It's pretty strange how similar our situations are.

However my anxiety manifests in the form of guilt rather than grief. But it still without a doubt effects my relationships and thought-process. 

Honestly, therapy, a decent diet, exercise(when i'm not lazy), the right supplements, acknowledging addictive tendencies and just working on recognizing how my mind functions, trying to be objectively aware of my thoughts and how they arise, maybe where they stem from, has helped me with moving on in life.

This is when to do deep breathing and then you picture something or someone that you hold to compete happiness. So for me it’s my dog.

This is when I do deep breathing and I picture myself sitting on a nice grass hill. In front of me is an empty freeway. Instead of cars and trucks going by I picture my thoughts. There are rules to remember on this one. It’s ok to have thoughts come and go. The same thoughts can pass by. None of them stop. After a bit, you will feel separated from your revolving thoughts 

3: happy place meditation  

This is unique to you. There is a moment in my life that I think about. Breath deep, then I always picture myself in this place, in that time. In my head I go through the actions within that place that made it so special to me. It’s kinda like having a good lucid dream that you control.

I didn’t start attempting to drive until I was 18, but that was when my anxiety went haywire and it was better for me to put off driving for a bit. (I drove on a country road with my mom and pretty much sobbed the whole time....)

When I started again in February 2018, I knew I had to take specific steps to ease into it. First I drove in the cemetery, then an empty parking lot, then a development, then around my town, and finally I began driving more on actual busy roads (I didn’t tackle highways until this past september). I think with each step I took 2-3 weeks on. It’s something I had to commit to, because I couldn’t allow myself to ignore it and become scared again. It was definitely a process. 

I’m still scared somewhat of driving. I’m not a fan at all. But if I had to drive somewhere right now as an emergency, I could do it. Which is a huge, huge accomplishment from even 2 years ago.

This without a doubt will bring up the very feeling of having a panic attack the way thinking of a loved one will bring up sensual or romantic or joyful feelings. You recall what it was like to have panic attack, you re-imagine it as it was, you feel the sensations that occur when you have a panic attack, your memories of your previous panic attacks bring about the very sensations of being in a panic attack. It's a slippery slope, and the best thing to do in my experience is to snip it in the bud, sometimes i'll literally tell myself to shut up, or i'll do something absurdly random and shake my head or my body rapidly and close my eyes to help let it leave my mind. 

Practicing it over and over is helpful. It's about you telling yourself a story. The story starts with a thought and how you react to that thought or thoughts. You have a sensation (maybe a small random pain in your chest), then you react (oh no what is that? am i having a heart attack? a stroke? cancer?) and then the physiological symptoms set in, increase heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, nervous movement, it happens very fast. But if you can learn how to cut it off, or how to teach yourself to not tell yourself the story that spirals you into panic by doing everything you can to either draw attention away from those ideas or objectively see how absurd and irrational they are, or talk yourself out of it (i.e. saying ""how many times have I said this before and been perfectly fine afterwards?""), you can learn how to stop it in its tracks, and although its kind of a ""band aid"" approach where it's just a superficial way of mitigating the anxiety, eventually it actually works as a deeper way of impacting your daily wandering panic-inducing thoughts",,1590636790,{},fs1vutl,False,t3_grxts0,False,True,t3_grxts0,/r/Anxiety/comments/grxts0/why_does_anxiety_about_panic_attacks_bring_them/fs1vutl/,1590644628,1,True,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,0,[],,,,,

* There *will* be an increase in cases. That's going to be inevitable, regardless of whether we open now or say, three months from now. But that doesn't mean things are going to rapidly spin out of control. At this point, we understand this virus a lot better than we did back in March, we have better treatments and medicines, and we know that social distancing measures work. As we head into these next few weeks and months, we have a better capability of handling this thing.
* If the number of cases *do* increase dramatically, governments have measures in place to pull back and enforce more social distancing guidelines.
* Make sure you still obey social distancing guidelines when you go out, wash your hands frequently, stay home if you're sick, all that jazz. Like I mentioned in my first point, those things *do* help. You're doing your part. Plus, going out every once in a while will do wonders for your mental health.
* Do your best to not worry thinking about a second wave. I know, easier said than done (I worry about this sometimes myself). But we have no idea what's going to happen these next few months and like I said before, we're learning more and more about this virus everyday. I actually found an article where Dr. Fauci said a second wave isn't inevitable as long as we keep doing what we're doing: [https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/499715-fauci-says-second-wave-of-coronavirus-infections-is-not-inevitable-we-can](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/499715-fauci-says-second-wave-of-coronavirus-infections-is-not-inevitable-we-can)

Edit: addendum--something important that I forgot to add earlier: I recommend looking up how your local county/government is counting tests before you jump to conclusions looking at numbers of cases. A lot of places have changed how they're keeping a count, such as counting 4 tests done for one person as 4 tests instead of just one.

I’m not sure if I have COVID, but I know 100% I have anxiety.

Anxiety can cause fatigue, occasional shortness of breath, dry your mouth and trigger cough reflexes,  even psychogenic fevers - all of which are symptoms of COVID. 

However, anxiety is rarely TRULY painful. Except in cases of muscle tension and headaches. Instead anxiety is typically just uncomfortable, distracting and painful to you psychologically. 

Focus then on physical pain. Asses if the fever you’ve been feeling has been persistent. Assess how bad the body aches may be. Determine if you have a dry cough. If it doesn’t meet the pain threshold and instead feels just like a minor annoyance, it’s probably not COVID, and even if it is, it’s only a minor form. 

Don’t waste time ruminating over what it could and cannot be and please don’t google the random symptoms. If you get it, trust me, you will probably know it. And if you get it without knowing it, congrats, you’re now immune with little hardship to get to that point.

I'll be fasting for a month starting tomorrow.  This year, I've made the personal decision to ""deactivate"" from all things COVID.  Unfortunately, that includes this thread.

It's been **so** helpful, but I also recognize that I have a tendency to check it multiple times a day, especially when I should be focusing on work, etc.  Some days are better than others, but I'm going to challenge myself and try to avoid it entirely for the next month.  It's going to be difficult... honestly probably more difficult than the food/water aspect.  If you see me back here before May 23, I must've encountered a wild Doomer and needed ammo to defeat it. :)

I'm also trying to recognize that at this point, no amount of good (or bad) news will change what I have control of in my own life.  I hope to return back and check in late May... hopefully by then we'll see countries have gradually reopened, life returning to normal, more successful vaccine and treatment trials, high antibody % results, etc.  Regardless, one thing is for sure: **what will be, will be**.  I hope everyone here stays safe, and most importantly, sane.

u/Anistmows \- thank you for this thread, and for everything.  You've helped more people than you could ever know.  I hope you are doing OK.  u/BaconFace2736 \-  thank you for starting the initial thread two months (??) ago, for searching through all of the doom and gloom early on and finding the positive and rational... you saved so many from spiraling.

I often dreaded classes with group work and presentations?! I tried to avoid any classes that required this (but I don’t recommend doing this Bc you miss out on good professors!) 
I would say give the online video classes a try. I personally think it is much, much easier than in person classes. I had one this previous quarter, it was the only one of my four classes that actually met up on zoom. At first I dreaded the thought, *why couldn’t this class just give me the online discussion / weekly hw like every other online class*, but something about not physically being in a room of people, it was actually easier to speak - also I felt like I learned a lot more by going to the classes then just learning on my own from text. The good thing about online class/ meetings is that if you have the answer and you’re scared of stumbling through when you say it, just write everything down on Microsoft word and read it word for word. That helps me because my worst fear is blanking out, and if you have everything you want to say written out then hypothetically you can’t mess up right? Also idk if you’re class requires your video on the entire time, but usually people can’t see you and you can kind of do whatever (less pressure then if you were actually in a classroom)
I know school is tough, especially with anxiety but there are resources to help as well that you should see what your school offers. also suggest emailing your professor and let them know what’s going on, at least they will have an idea and can possibly compromise such as no video, etc.

Here’s what I do when I get into a situation like that. I tell myself that what’s done is done - there’s nothing I can do about it, why worry myself about it?  What will happen will happen.  That helps me put it into perspective and forget about it.  When I inevitably start worrying about it again, I do that again.

But your anxiety doesn’t define you as a person. In fact it’s a very small part of your story. An analogous way to see it is like looking human life’s existence in relation to the birth of the galaxy. We’re designed to endure fight or flight, and you’re constantly being triggered by the state of the world as well as your own issues. 

Your anxiety won’t let you slow down because time is it’s enemy. 

I hope you find some peace. I don’t claim to know the answers, but I find and found comfort in knowing people went through the same thing.

This approach - derived in part from mindfulness - requires work, and I'm still learning, but it's already done wonders for me.

The natural inclination is to try to ignore, dismiss or ""fight"" this critical voice. Just like we try to avoid, suppress or fight anxiety itself. 

But that just feeds it.

Believe it or not, the voice is your friend. It's just a deeply buried, terrified, confused and angry part of you, and it's trying to help, in its own (ineffective and harmful) way.

Instead of trying to silence it, try observing it as it speaks up. Listen to it non-judgmentally, without accepting or agreeing with what it says. Sit with it. Treat it with kindness. Befriend it.

I’m not sure if part of it IS BECAUSE I have actually hurt people in the past due to my unaware actions and comments that I’ve said (I’ve lost a lot of good friendships this way, makes me depressed to think about all the people I’ve hurt by mistake or at the time was being cruel).

I’m so so critical of myself because I worry about scaring someone off, I worry I’m talking to little, not enough, am I talking too much about me? What should I ask them? They’re judging me, I’m saying “like” to much, my voice is too weird sounding, I must have did something for them to not like me, I said something I shouldn’t have, I’m too blunt, I’m too cynical, no one likes to be around a negative person, am I overstepping my boundaries, stop it, no wonder you’re alone, you’ve hurt a lot of people, this is why you have very few people left, the list could go on, but these are the thoughts that spiral through my head- usually right after a conversation or during one with other people. I often get even more anxious if someone displays off putting body language, but after I try to convince myself maybe they had a bad day, maybe they’re going through what I am too and struggle with talking to people.

I’ve always hated public speaking, I can’t stand being the center of attention, and it’s become so difficult for me to make friends. I’d really love to make new friends, the ones I had from high school- I was a poor friend... The ones in college- we grew apart. I often blame myself for not keeping in touch more (although one friend we do chat casually online from time to time).

It’s hard because when I have shown my true self to people it’s quite intense, judgemental, and often cynical. I’ve been trying to work on that, but it’s like how do I approach anyone? How do you even make real friends anymore? I have interests I’m passionate about and I’d like to connect, but I’m not sure how to find people locally. I’m terrified to use one of those apps, and I’m a bit of a coward myself. I keep to myself because I don’t trust people, I often doubt kindness and see it as a facade to get something from me. I feel like I come off as awkward and cold too, even though the few people I know closely say I don’t. But my anxiety likes to tell me oh yes, yes I am. Anxiety loves to remind us all of how we will never be good enough for anything, that because we aren’t perfect (which not one living thing is) we don’t deserve anything.

I have my good internet friends, but it’s a bit lonely at times when I’d like to just do something or go somewhere, but often lately I’m too drained to commit to plans or “show up”. I’m not sure if it’s just this year or getting older, but I’ve been so so exhausted lately. I’ve dealt with anxiety since I was in elementary school, and I know how tiresome it can be, but lately it’s like a battle of I need to do something, I’m “insert shitty self comment” if I don’t do it, then I push myself to do it and I end up being burned out even more.

My personal experience is that anxiety is weirdly almost like egotism, but coming from the other direction - our fears make it all about us when it doesn't have to be. I've seen people who are afraid of dogs cower and exclaim in fear and surprise, but the dog, who was minding his own business, suddenly encounters this weird being who behaves differently from other people, and therefore becomes interested, which of course makes the scared person even more scared (when he didn't have to be before).

I've lost at least one job this way because I felt paranoia and fear about how I was being treated because I felt my contributions were marginalized. I reacted based on this fear and I'm pretty certain that what wasn't a problem became one because of how I acted on my feelings. It's basically a self-fulfilling prophecy.

It's taken me decades of struggle and growth, but for me, I've found some comfort in the 'fake it till you make it' approach. Everytime I feel scared or threatened, I remind myself that I'm overreacting and people don't think of your mistakes, or oversights, or what you could have done better, and are not criminalizing me for it. I find that unless there is incontrovertible proof that they hate/despise me, it's all in my head. Yes, I could be right that they did indeed hate me, but that probably happens one in ten or twenty times. Why sabotage the other nine or nineteen times by reacting badly, right?

[],,40jbaby,,,[],,,,text,t2_7lgnlzrr,False,False,[],"Hey, you don't sound ungrateful at all! It might seem like a minor issue, but when you have anxiety, you overthink it and it can cause feelings of stress. I completely understand where you're coming from, my friend recently gave me her laptop which is much better and faster than my current one. And I was very overwhelmed by the idea of transferring my files and setting up, etc. I'm used to transferring phone files but I've only ever had one laptop so no need to transfer. 

What I did was I plugged in my 36gb USB, went to file explorer on my laptop and basically went through all the folders and files there, copied and pasted them onto my USB folder. I didn't have enough space to transfer all my files so I used my 2nd USB, and once I transferred all the files and knew it was safe to unplug the USB, I did so and plugged the USB into my new laptop, basically copying and pasting the files onto the folders on the laptop. So now all my files are on my new laptop. If you want extra certainty that your files are backed up and safe, you can upload as many of them as possible (start with most important) to Google Drive, OneDrive, Cloud, etc. So now if you happen to lose them physically, you've got them online. 

Change is also hard for me to deal with and thinking of all the new things I have to do overwhelms me a lot. My advice to you would be to do all of this in a calm environment, maybe on your own, play some relaxing music in the background, or just music you like, eat some takeaway, etc. Basically create a chill, relaxing environment so that you don't have the pressure of time and you can really take your time to sort everything out and do what you need to do. I find that when it comes to situations that I'm very stressed and anxious about, if possible, it's best to do it in an environment where I am relaxed and there's nothing else around me to stimulate and fuel my anxiety. Hopefully this works for you too!! If something goes wrong, take a few deep breaths and go to the Internet to search for answers to the problem, if you can't find a solution then you can take a break and come back to it later.

Put your laptops side by side and try and recreate the same thing on your new laptop, same background, same layout, same apps etc. The laptop that my friend gave me is a smaller lenovo whilst I am used to a 15inch HP, there are quite a few differences in the new laptop, but I've tried to deal with this by making the new laptop feel like it's mine and making it the same as the old one as much as I can, which means having my layout the same, using Opera as my browser, having a cute background, ordering my apps/software same as before, etc. Get some laptop stickers or a skin cover to make it feel like it's yours. 

Overall, my advice is to just take your time with it, you can start planning in advance how you want to go about it or you can look on the Internet for tips. Take your time, chill with it, and keep reminding yourself that it's for the better. Learning to adapt to new situations is a huge part of dealing with anxiety. Hope this works for you! Sorry for the super long reply, I know for me sometimes big walls of text can be super confusing and even more stressful to decipher and breakdown, so if you want a more simplified version then you can just message me, I'll be happy to help you out!! 😊 Never feel like you're overreacting or being ungrateful, etc. Certain situations can make us feel overwhelmed and stressed no matter how minor it may be to someone else, and that's okay, it's just about finding ways to manage it.",,1602390007,{},g8fi2zz,False,t3_j8f3km,False,True,t3_j8f3km,/r/Anxiety/comments/j8f3km/overwhelmed_by_the_idea_of_buying_a_new_laptop/g8fi2zz/,1602397110,2,True,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,0,[],,,,,

Pure O is all intrusive thoughts no obvious compulsions.. While I'm not saying you have OCD, but it is an anxiety disorder so some of the tips I learned might help you.

First you can't argue or interact with intrusive thoughts. Say I have thought of getting some rare disease pops into my head and I'm afraid of dying. Instead of trying to reassure myself that the disease is rare, I'm feeling healthy, I just had a doctor's visit, etc. I simple go ""Hmm, that's a thought"" I acknowledge it's there. I acknowledge how it makes me feel, but that's it. Arguing with the thought, and seeking reassurance just feeds the thought. By not engaging it and labeling it as an intrusive thought you are starving it. Your teaching your subconscious to recognize to only react to non intrusive thoughts. It can be hard to set with those feelings, but the thoughts and feelings eventually go away.

I hope that makes sense. I'm glad your seeking professional help. It is helping me a lot. I found the you tube channels Therap in a Nutshell, Dr. Rami Nader, and several others very helpful for me to fill in the gaps between therapy sessions. I also know some good book recommendations if you want.

The short version of my story goes like this: 
-got depression at puberty 

-started Prozac at 15

- I got paranoid about being on meds and quit them. 

-about 5 years later I started meds again, but a different one. 

-again I got paranoid and stopped taking them. 

-another 5 years later, I was finally ready to really commit to the process. I started  taking Zoloft and immediately saw improvement. Whenever I have doubts or think it’s not working, I email my doctor immediately. I’ve had my dose gradually increased over the years, and I’m finally at a level where I can go months without having an episode of any kind. Due to current world events, I’m back to struggling a bit, but am keeping myself accountable to being honest with my doctor every step of the way. 

I’m definitely a meds success story, and the only reason that I wasn’t one sooner is because both times I stopped taking them without telling my doctor how I was feeling.

This is r/anxiety after all, it's not as if I don't understand this sentiment. However, I have measured my blood oxygen level both wearing a mask and not wearing one and it is the same. If it is the sensation of being smothered, I advise you find a lighter clothe mask or surgical mask. 

\&gt;  i guess i am selfish when it comes down to it.

Yes, that is what you are being right now. Are you able to cope with the fact that you may end up killing somebody because of this, or will you change your behavior to minimize this risk?

\&gt; i dont want anyone to die and i dont want to be the reason anyone got the virus but

Yeah, well, hopefully you don't kill or maim somebody by the time this is over. Ohio is experiencing an exponential increase in cases. I live in a currently case-stable state with an impending increase, and I personally know of over 20 people who have had it. Perhaps you don't know many people. 

\&gt; i just cant help what i believe. i just dont think the masks are necessary.

You can, actually, help what you believe, because you can't have an opinion on a falsehood. I'm telling you things that are true, I'm not going to ""respect"" your ""opinion"" because an opinion means something is debatable. ""Masks work but I don't want to wear one because I don't believe risky populations are worthy of my effort"" is an opinion. ""Masks don't work"" is a falsehood. You believing that is simply willful ignorance. Like, if you put a barrier in front of something, it stops projectiles. Do you not also believe in bulletproof vests?

\&gt;  i rarely leave the house due to my mental health issues so i'm really not affecting or being affected by all this stuff for the most part.

Except for when you do. When you do enter an occupied, enclosed building without a mask you may be affecting people.

I got a prescription for klonopin as needed, buspar daily, and zofran for when the nausea is just too much.

It hasn’t gotten rid of it but it has made it a bit more livable. I can usually have 3-4 smaller meals a day of bland things now so I’m not currently losing any more weight.

Applesauce is great too. 

I’m not sure how the healthcare in the UK works but across the pond most general doctors will give some basic non controlled medicine like buspar or hydroxyzine for daily anxiety. It won’t cure you but it can help hold you over until you can get to a psych.

You need specific help for your specific circumstances, and to understand why your anxiety is triggered by sex. For what it's worth, sex can be a very vulnerable act, and if you're afraid of vulnerability or strong emotions, it might be the last thing you want. Focus on rekindling friendships, developing healthy platonic connections, and establish a supportive, healthy romantic relationship before attempting to have sex with a person. Tell a prospective partner about your anxieties during sex, and agree beforehand that either of you can say ""stop"" at any point and end it. Talking about it, normalising your fears, and minimising the drama of it can help.

I have a lot of anxiety around sex, probably for different reasons to you. My anxiety is usually fine during the act, but a day or so afterwards, I experience massive anxiety and paranoia. I know this is due to past events and gender dysphoria, and I know I'm not being rational, so I talk with my therapist and try to stay calm.

You don't need to avoid people. Having friendships and healthy relationships isn't synonymous with needing to have sex. I don't have sex with my friends. In fact, I rarely have it, because the payoff isn't usually worth the freakout. But (and this is just my tactic) I do occasionally have one-night-stands just to prove to myself that I can. That has, weirdly, helped to reduce my anxiety. There are no emotional expectations beyond one night, and I use another person as a way of experimenting. (They're using me too, so it's mutual.) It's almost like a business arrangement. We meet, we do this thing, then I never see you again. I have an experience, and I see how my anxiety responds. But that doesn't work for everyone.

I *highly* advise seeing a therapist if you can’t get this managed in your own (which, admittedly, I should probably see a therapist too but... I am much more comfortable in-person than over zoom or Skype). 

I’m currently 20 but funny enough my thanatophobia developed right after turning 18- it was the end of senior year and all I could think about was “Holy shit, all this fun stuff and happy times will end one day.” Which, like... yeah- they’re ending with the school year but my mind went to death. I also got screwed over and took a gap year but was unemployed so I basically spent a whole year locked inside my house with my fear of death and nobody to talk to so... you can see how things went out haha.

Basically by 19 I was spending every night restless, in the bathroom, silently sobbing and was gently banging my head on the wall because it’s the most I could do from spiraling. Now, 1.5 years later and I’m a lot better!! I DID develop anxiety this year, but it was anxiety related to nausea and my belly-button (long story) so... at most semi-related? It’s so funny because I MC had an anxiety attack and it’s very different from those “fear attacks”, they left me feeling hopeless and in despair- anxiety leaves me feeling pain and misery if that makes sense? Still...

I’m not “over” my thanatophobia, and I’m sure there are support groups online for it. What helped me though was finding... not “spiritual” but “death acceptance” thing? Like Cloud Atlas for example- a beautiful book, a great movie. In the middle of my death-crisis I was VERY secular, but prior to that I had always believed in ghosts and that psychics or witchcraft might have some truth to them, wasn’t religious though. Now I’m... mostly secular. I say I’m 1/2 skeptic and 1/2 enthusiast when it comes to spirituality and whatnot.

Still, Cloud Atlas scratches some itch for me and helped out. So did the show “The Magicians”, the movie “Avatar” (the blue-people one), the show “Avatar” (the Airbender and Kora one lol), and oddly enough the show “Big Mouth” on Netflix REALLY helped with my anxiety??

I'm in the architecture/design field so a lot of what I can do is possible remotely with the exception of site visits which has been the exception to the WFH. There have been some pros and cons and I've definitely learned a lot about myself.

I tend to have anxiety related to work and I feel like I constantly have to be ""on"" and never really relax while I've been WFH full time. When I commuted I had a really definite boundary between work and home life and that has kind of blurred in a way I don't love. The few times I have gone into the office I feel a lot better later in the day because I don't feel like I always need to catch up. It's also helped to have a defined space to work that I can close off.

One of the major benefits is not having my anxiety affect my attendance. I started this job back in February of last year and I had been missing a lot of work at my previous job due to anxiety. For the most part, on the days I feel crappy I can roll out of bed and get my work done and not have to interact with anyone save for a few scheduled meetings so there isn't any real reason for me to call in. My office has been awesome about accommodating us and it sounds like when things are back to ""normal"" we'll all be WFH part time (2 or 3 days per week). This is definitely the ideal setup for me personally.

Because again, the hardcore Reddit types are too busy shaming us behind the keyboard, and even the big #staytfhome people I know irl are starting to soften up.

Since my state ended its lockdown, I've visited a friend (1 person other than me), I've visited my parents (2 people other than me), and I've been to a restaurant albeit alone and during off-peak hours (multiple people other than me, but only 1 interacting with me at a time, and only momentarily).  And I've been to the grocery store, which of course has a bunch of people, but I wear a mask for that and interactions are only momentary).

I couldn't bring myself to go to a Mother's Day meal at my grandparents' house, where both my parents and aunt/uncle would be attending.  That's 6 people other than me for more than momentary, which is more than I feel comfortable handling at the moment.

Right now being out in public feels like walking on eggshells.  Is this REALLY allowed?  Even if it's legally allowed, is it **socially** allowed right now?  Am I REALLY safe?  Why is THIS restaurant still closed for dine-in while these others are open?  Will they open when we go to phase 2?  Will I get yelled at if I don't wear a mask?  Will I get yelled at if I AM wearing a mask?  Is that person actually 6 feet away from me or is it really more like 5 feet, 10 inches, and does it even really matter?

I've noticed a lot more tension between me and my dad due to the fact that I'm trying to convince him that COVID is real and that precautions need to be taken. Its gotten better, due to other family members agreeing with me and making him comply, but it definitely feels like he doesn't actually believe that things are getting real out there.

**I'm wondering if anyone else feels my pain/frustration here?**

Sorry for the rant, but I've definitely had more arguments with people here at home, explaining to them that no, rinsing your hands with water for 5 seconds is NOT going to kill the virus you MAY have picked up from bringing in groceries. Or that you NEED to use soap for 20 seconds and get under those fingernails. Or that you NEED to keep track of what you are touching when your hands are 'dirty'/unwashed. Because, there is no point to washing your hands after coming in if you've already been touching all the doorknobs and cupboards and stuff in the house, including your phone/keys/wallet. Or that we can't just go to the grocery store to 'see the shop' - essential trips only (ie. if you're not buying, dont' go walking around the store). Or to wear a mask/face covering/gloves. Or that, because all luxury/social places were open a month ago doesn't mean they are open now, so saying that 'everything's running as normal' a million times isn't going to make it true, as much as we all wish that could be safely achieved right now. Also, saying that 'the neighbours went out and are socializing with friends with no distancing so see, everything's normal and we can do the same' isn't responsible or safe. The constant 'temptation' from neighbours (who are completely NOT following distancing or any safety precautions whatsoever) doesn't help because I get told that 'the neighbours are doing it and they're having more fun than us, who are locked up inside when there is clearly nothing to worry about because we've not seen them sick yet so its ok'. Anyone else have neighbours that aren't following rules? Do you think this creates temptation or a sense of false security to those who ARE quarantining properly? Do you think its a source of family tension (ie. when one member sees neighbours outside having fun with friends and argues that its ok) ?

I'm not badmouthing my family in any way, i understand they are likely stressed and anxious about the situation as we all are and maybe that's how they cope-by avoiding acceptance. But its definitely hard on me who has to deal with it. I've explained many times, that no, I am not implementing rules because I don't 'want my family to have fun', that its for safety and that if one person in the household gets the virus, they will bring it home.

Weeks have passed since preliminary results from the NIH’s clinical trial on remdesvir were released via press release. Last Friday, the full, peer-reviewed data were published by the New England Journal of Medicine. The findings are based on data from the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) sponsored by the NIAID.

The randomized, controlled trial enrolled hospitalized adults with COVID-19 with evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement (generally moderate to severe disease). Investigators found that remdesivir, made by Gilead, was most beneficial for hospitalized patients with severe disease who required supplemental oxygen.

In recent days, Illinois health officials have begun posting a “recovery rate” on their coronavirus data website, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker discussed the new addition to the state statistics on Wednesday.

During his daily coronavirus press briefing, Pritzker said that the percentage was designed to relay the message that a COVID-19 diagnosis “is not a death sentence,” and that a vast majority of individuals who test positive for the disease recover.

“What we’re trying to do is to make sure that people understand that when you get COVID-19, it’s not a death sentence,” Pritzker said. “In fact, about 80 percent of people who get COVID-19 experience mild-to-moderate symptoms, then recover. It’s really 20 percent or so that get it and have something more serious.”

According to the IDPH website, the current “recovery rate” stands at 92 percent.

“What we’re talking about here is trying to report a number that shows how many people have already had COVID-19 that have recovered,” he said. “The 92 percent is a reflection of many people who’ve recovered and have gone about their lives and haven’t gotten COVID-19 again. So that’s what we’re trying to do: to give a number we had not before provided.”

City-based pharma firm Raghava Life Sciences Pvt Limited (RLS), which is into API production, on Wednesday claimed Favipiravir antiviral drug has been producing better results in treating Covid-19 patients compared to Remdesivir which is current under clinical trials in the US. ""The clinical trials done using Favipiravir have so far shown positive results. Published results of a clinical trial of Favipiravir indicate that out of 80 patients, 35 who took the drug demonstrated significantly shorter viral clearance time compared to those who didn't. The recovery period was shortened by four days from 11,"" Lohit Reddy P, Director, RLS, said in a statement.

The seven-day day clinical recovery rate also increased from 55.86 per cent to 71.43 per cent, he added. Favipiravir, an antiviral medication used to treat influenza in Japan, is a generic version of Avian. At present, the drug is being studied as an experimental drug in treating the novel corona virus disease in China and other countries. Reddy said that RLS is one of the first few companies in India to commercialise Favipiravir API (active pharmaceutical ingredient). ""We are in talks with major formulation companies within India and outside the country to manufacture Favipiravir tablets. It is a better and cheaper alternative to Remedesivir,"" he said.

New Jersey's largest and most comprehensive health network, has utilized its large observational database of more than 3,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients to show that the touted malaria treatment, hydroxychloroquine, does not improve survival for hospitalized patients. **However, another drug, tocilizumab, appears to improve survival among critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients. If confirmed, tocilizumab would become the first medication improving survival from COVID-19.**

These major findings were released today on the online platform medRxiv, which allow researchers to share critical scientific information rapidly prior to publication in peer-reviewed journals. Given the potential lifesaving findings of tocilizumab the Hackensack Meridian Health researchers believe that sharing this information rapidly is important. The results are based on the new data analysis platform - the HMH Universal Observational Database for COVID-19, or RECOVERY, which compiles outcomes from 13 Hackensack Meridian Health hospitals throughout New Jersey. This database enhances the understanding of this disease and helps rapidly identify effective therapies.

""I am so proud of our Hackensack Meridian Health clinical and research teams who are helping to tackle this unprecedented global challenge,"" said Robert C. Garrett, FACHE, chief executive officer of Hackensack Meridian Health. ""This groundbreaking study will help our hospitals, as well as hospitals throughout the world, better understand the effectiveness of certain forms of treatment and the impact of certain risk factors. Our researchers' observations that tocilizumab may improve survival among the most critically ill could alter the course of the pandemic if confirmed in randomized trials – and Hackensack Meridian Health is participating in those randomized trials as well.""

Can say, I've been hypersensitive about this because I notice it in myself and others. Especially in online communities. It's just in the last 2-3 weeks that I've been trying to work on this in my own speech habits. And be assertive when others use more judgement-laden speech pattern. Which I do feel are likely not intended.

Wish we would've all been taught this type of thing in school:

- Using I statements instead of you statements
- If what someone said isn't clear, watch out for self-assumptions and practice asking clarifying questions if needed
- Problems with the word ""should""

There's a whole curriculum there. And I wonder how much happier communities might be if they learned skills for more effective communication. By ""effective"" I'm trying to say truly hearing each other and understanding each other's perspective instead of judging.

The irony being that I'm running around judging other's communication style. Do strive for ""question assertively and not judgmentally"" which is tricky to manage.

Cheers and thanks for a respectful dialogue. Glad you're on here trying to help others. I agree that for me anxiety is a daily hell and it's tough figuring it out.

I recently (finally) stopped Wellbutrin myself, after taking it for about a year and a half. I took it in hopes of addressing both depression and anxiety,  and chose this one because it’s the only med that is not associated with weight gain. I found that Wellbutrin effectively addressed my depression, but ended up exacerbated my anxiety, and worse, caused my old OCD and impulse control disorder I’d made so much progress with to re-emerge. (I’ve struggled with trichotillomania, was treated with hypnotherapy, and literally stopped for 8 years before I took this med - then boom - right back to where I started). My before bed routine became 45 mins + of checking and rechecking doors, locks, closets throughout a 4 bedroom house in a painfully specific order that I often “messed up” and needed to start over again 🤦🏻‍♀️

I spoke with my doctor about all of this, and she confirmed that Wellbutrin has a strong tendency to exacerbate anxiety disorders. I know everyone responds differently, but just wanted to let you know this is what I’ve heard and experienced. Just something to consider if your primary treatment goal is to address anxiety... Wellbutrin may do the opposite. 

It’s really amazing how powerful these medications can be, and how different each can impact our lives and emotions. I usually give a medication one month, and then assess it’s benefit of lack thereof. Try to talk to your doctor as soon as you can, the more info they have the better they can try to pinpoint a medication suited to your needs.

A good therapist is gold. But a ""good therapist"" depends a lot on the patient. How open are you willing to be? Remember, regardless of the ""type of therapy"", if the patient is unwilling to open up, there is nothing there. 

I was actually meaning more scientific.Therapy is not very scientific . It is still very much helpful. The thing is, with therapy, each individual case is going to be so very different from the next. Its all subjective, which plays a massive role when it comes to medications. All meds are given based on symptoms, which vary wildly. We seriously are in our infancy, but we are getting there.  

Many critique medications , as if they expect us to have the ability  to customize them, thats not possible.



My suggestion to any new to therapy, or considering it, is to be as open as possible. Leave your shame at the door, pour your heart out, cry, whatever. They are not going to see you as anything but one in pain, and they deal with it on a daily basis, plus, as an added bonus, a therapist is also human.

SSRIs do not change your brain, who you are, or how you think. They are a tool that helps break the cycles of depression and anxiety so that you can begin to help yourself get better. They work very well when coupled with changes in lifestyle and therapy. They take time to work and to adjust to - usually at least a month or more - and any side effects can usually be resolved through adjustments in dosage, what time you take it, or what medicine you end up on.

Try to treat your anxious thoughts and feelings as a seperate entity from you. Acknowledge the thoughts you have when they pop up in your head (don't try to ""resist"" unpleasant thoughts), and label them as just ""anxious thoughts"". 

Remember, you are not your thoughts, you are just the awareness of your thoughts. This will help you seperate yourself from these anxious feelings.

In summary:

\- 87% recovery and discharge rate for COVID patients

\- 1/4 of their COVID patients were transfers from nursing/care homes

\- Performed COVID tests on over 4500 pre-procedure and emergency patients, less than 1% tested positive.

\- Most importantly: "" Because of careful planning and management of resources, Cedars-Sinai has bed and staff capacity to care for all patients and is ready for a surge should it occur. ""

It was something that I was so excited to start as soon as I turned 16, but those dreams were very quickly smushed by my anxiety. It got worse earlier this year when my boyfriend got in an accident and totalled his car on our way to the grocery store, fortunately nobody was hurt, but it scared me a lot. 

I used to think I was just being a baby for not being able to drive, or that I was useless for having to depend on people. I worried that people my age would think I was being a “bum” or that they would think I was immature. But once I stopped looking at it from a self deprecating perspective, and instead from a medical perspective, I realized that anxiety is a medical condition, one that I always had, and always will have, and it should be treated accordingly. There are tons of disabilities and conditions that can prevent people from driving, from visual impairment, physical disabilities, epilepsy,  intellectual disabilities and anxiety. All of those people still have inherent value as people, and can still go on to achieve many things in life. Driving isn’t the deciding factor to a person’s worth, or their ability to succeed in life. 

Some people NEVER drive, and that’s okay (Especially if you happen to live in a city with at least decent public transportation). People will tell you that you have to, and they’ll tell you it’s easy, but in the long run, making statements like that only adds to the difficulty and stigma that we have to face. I’m not saying that you never will, or that you shouldn’t try, but I want you to remember that it’s your choice, and if it’s too difficult or too painful you don’t have to put yourself through it. Take things at your own pace. Push yourself if that’s what you feel like you need, but don’t overdo it.

The past few months have been the worst its ever been, and I've been trying to learn to manage it ever since I've been home from school because of Covid 19. 

Anyways, there are a few things that have actually helped me out a lot. First is I think that having a good diet and working out can really help. I'm not a gym rat or anything but I started working out more regularly and it can really reduce my anxiety. 

When it comes to my health anxiety I started making lists of my different health concerns that I have had, and it helps me visualize that these fears and paranoias were never valid. So when a new symptom pops up I can more easily work out in my mind that I'm just panicking and probably not having a heart attack at 20 years old lol. Also it's important to note that the mind is very powerful and anxiety can actually create a lot of physical symptoms.

STAY OFF GOOGLE!!!! I have spent so many hours browsing horrible illnesses and symptoms and it always does more harm then good and makes anxiety worse. 

And lastly, this goes for guy and girls, but dealing with these issues as a guy can come with its own challenges. For years I wasn't even honest with myself with my own mental health issues I was dealing with. Even to this day, none of my friends or family really know the extent of my anxiety.

I have been struggling with anxiety for a long time now. Started the treatment last year and everything was starting to work out but then... pandemic. I also have ADHD so my academic life right now is below shit. I’ve been missing on taking my meds, I feel basically numb to everything that I SHOULD worry. I started a relationship 5 months ago, right before the pandemic started (he lives 2:30 hrs away so we barely see eachother) we talk everyday most of the day, he helps me sleep and since I’ve been with him my anxiety towards most things has “vanished” (I’m kind of just ignoring them, that doesn’t help, but I manage to do with without having a breakdown about procrastinating). Although I’m getting better towards everything else, I’m a mess in the relationship, it seems like all of my anxiety, overthinking and insecurities have shifted towards the relationship itself. He is my first boyfriend, so I am in new territory here, I’m having trust issues and insecurities about my body, what I mean to him and all of it. He doesn’t suffer from anxiety like I do, so my overthinking can be suffocating for him, I try to channel and talk to friends about what he does and my worries, and bc of that most of my friends have this terrible image of him (that doesn’t reflect how he is, although what I tell them is true, I mostly tel them my worries so they only see the bad part). I’ve been needing him to give me affection and attention, and it doesn’t match his personality, he is colder, but that brings up so much.... I’m not even sure where I wanna get with this, I just needed to vent I guess....

Anxiety forces us to think of the worst possible scenarios always anyway, so for me it helps to “face it.” Being in a relationship and having anxiety is definitely tough because our minds always “go there” and it often takes a toll on us and the relationship as a whole. 

Unfortunately life is unpredictable, and that’s something we can’t control. It’s helpful to try and focus on the things we can control and try not to let our minds wander too much. For me, when i feel myself starting to spiral into an anxious thought, I’ll tell myself, “I’m not going to think about that right now” and concentrate on directing my energy elsewhere.

Something my counselor suggested to me to try was to say out loud the anxious thought that you think is true ie “I have something the Doctor’s missed Bc I know I do”. Say it out loud to yourself (preferably somewhere you can get some peace and quite) so you hear yourself say it. Repeat this. The point of this is that the logical side of your Brain will engage the idea from hearing it and you will start to bring your self to a place where you start questioning how untrue it sounds.

Officials confirmed a further 248 patients had beaten the virus as the recovery tally climbed to 54,863.

No patients died for the third consecutive day, as the death toll in the Emirates remained at 351.

The latest infections were identified after an additional 27,811 tests were carried out.

The number of coronavirus cases nationwide now stands at 61,163.

The UAE has conducted close to 5.2 million Covid-19 tests since the outbreak began.

Tests are being carried out at sewage plants across England as the government tries to get a ""head start"" on where new coronavirus outbreaks may happen.

During the trials, experts at 44 treatment works will be analysing samples of wastewater for fragments of the disease.

Tests can detect the genetic residues of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

The residues could be used to discover the presence of the virus in the population, including among those who do not have symptoms or before they develop them.

People infected with coronavirus are believed to shed it in their faeces.

The World Health Organisation has said there is no evidence that COVID-19 has been transmitted through sewerage systems, but scientists believe nationwide monitoring of them could be a good way to identify future hotspots.

I will be a senior at the University of Arizona in January 2021. During the Fall 2019 semester, I sought out the help of a therapist because i was really struggling with anxiety and panic attacks. I am sorry that you are experiencing panic attacks. I think that it is important to first acknowledge to yourself that you are having a panic attack and that you will live through it. next, i would try to get in some deep controlled breaths (if you can). I know that it can be hard to catch your breath when your heart rate is bouncing all over the place during a panic attack episode. When you are feeling better, perhaps tomorrow or another day, go to the store and buy some Natrol 5-HTP tablets. Whenever i am having a hard time managing my anxiety, I take 50-100mg of 5-HTP and it calms me down significantly. 5-HTP is a precursor to serotonin. After 5-HTP is ingested and broken down, it crosses the blood-brain barrier and converts into serotonin. If you need a sleep aid, i would recommend Natrol melatonin. The melatonin tablets come in various doses, but i get the 5mg time release tablets. I take 15mg of melatonin (three 5mg tablets) every night before i go to bed. After a panic attacks subsides, i also break every hour down into 15 minute increments and take my day minute by minute.

But recently due to a toxic and extremely abusive relationship ending I became suicidal. Now mind you I don’t believe I could ever hurt myself and do that to my loved ones, but it was one of the scariest things that has happened in my life. I took to Facebook and made a post asking for help. About 10-12 people I haven’t seen or talked to in 12 years reached out to me to offer support. I was absolutely blown away, I didn’t think anyone would actually help me, but a lot of people did. There are people out there who care for you, guaranteed.

As far as anxiety goes, you need to remember that it is impossible for someone without anxiety to fully understand. They either don’t understand or they think they understand. The best therapist in my life told me he’s been studying and doing this for decades and he flat out said that he’s studied it but there’s no way he can ever truly understand what I go through because he doesn’t have anxiety. He thinks he understands. There is no true understanding of mental health disorders unless you suffer from them. Keep that in mind because people care but they don’t truly understand so they have a hard time helping you.

Do not feel guilty for your anxiety, it’s a black hole that you did not choose to have. I’ve wrestled with guilt over my anxiety before but then I realized, why should I feel guilty for suffering? I’m the one suffering from it, and I didn’t ask Santa to give me a mental health disorder for Christmas, so what is there to really feel guilty about.

Anxiety is hell, Owl. But there are many people out there who also suffer from it. Take this subreddit for instance. In that sense, you are certainly not alone and there are indeed many people who experience things exactly similar to you everyday. That’s why you’re posting here in the first place, is it not? To get help from other people who experience similar things?

What I’d recommend if anxiety is really messing with your life is to get into a CBT, DBT or combination therapy group to learn to cope with your anxiety, because it’s unfortunately not going to just go away on it’s own.

Continue to work with professionals to find out what's going on and find something that works for you.  The good news is, it may very well be anxiety.  I also go through periods where I have trouble breathing for large chunks of the day for days on end.

Since Covid has disrupted my usual work schedules and routines, I've had a lot of anxiety.  Otherwise everything is great and I'm not too worried about anything.  I've always been uptight/anxious, but never diagnosed.  About 5 months ago I started having heart palpitations and some trouble breathing and went to the doctor.  The did an ECG and some labs and said it was just anxiety (GAD) and recommended an SSRI.  I've since been exercising more, eating better, cut out caffeine and dairy, gotten into a steady sleep routine, read a lot on it, talked with therapists (which isn't something I ever planned to do).  That may have helped some, but I continued to be anxious about the anxiety and it seemed to be getting worse.  About a month ago, after 4 months of making all the life changes I could, I finally started an SSRI (something else I never wanted to do) because I continued to get worse.  I talked with my doctor and explained that I would be willing to take for six months or so, but then I would want to wean off and see how I did.  I've had friends do just that successfully.  Too early to give results, but I am at peace with the decision.  I share all of this just to say that I wish I had started the meds a couple of months ago.  In retrospect, it's not much different than taking something to block pain for a hurt shoulder.

As for the shortness of breath, I realized that what it really was is a really excited (or anxious) feeling in my chest.  Kinda like you haven't seen your best friend for a year and your waiting for them to arrive. Just a super-excited feeling.  It's not a bad feeling at all, but it causes me to feel like my chest is heavy.  I suppose it's just the adrenaline making me super-excited. I find it helps to talk to myself and my body that ""I am safe"" and ""thank you body for trying to protect me, but I am in no danger so you can relax"".  That and rubbing my chests where I feel the excitement in a circular motion seems to help alleviate it some.  I've also found that sleeping with a heating pad on my chest on the nights where it is keeping me up helps.

Another good trick is to use ice.  Take an ice cold shower to help shock your body into focusing the physical.  Put an ice cube on your neck or something.

But don’t let it get to you too much.  It’s tough I know but know that it can’t hurt you.  And if you want to truly take hold of it, you will need to develop these mechanisms to help you face it head on.

Eventually it will normalize.

[],,lookprettysinking,,,[],,,,text,t2_ifa5rmz,False,False,[],"Part Two:

**""CALL A FRIEND:** Don’t suffer alone. Call a mate - someone who’ll listen while you have a bit of a rant, or a cry, or a general wobble. Someone you can trust not to judge you and who’ll just sympathize. And if you get one of those calls, just be nice to them. You only need to be kind. You can’t fix what’s going on so just give them a bit of space to rant and tell them they're normal and doing great. And if you’re OK, call your friends and check in on them. Especially if they’ve gone silent.

**LAUGH**: it doesn’t matter what is funny – laughter is a huge releaser of endorphins. Silly memes, silly jokes, stand-up, rolling around with your kids – videos on youtube. The sillier the better. Also v good for bonding with friends, which will also help you feel less alone.

**DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR HANDS.** Yes you can meditate if this is your bag, it’s amazing. But if it’s not, and personally I’m rubbish, then trying to start when you’re already anxious is really hard. So do something instead with your hands, that you have to focus on to get right. Cook. Tidy. Knit. Draw. Bake. Garden. Mend things. This is what nice middle class therapists like me call Mindfulness.

**TREAT YOUR BODY:** We hold stress in our bodies at least as much as our minds. Take a bath or a shower. Put on things that feel good on your skin. Use nice smelling body creams. Stretch. Skip. Do yoga. Dance. Eat healthy but delicious things - fresh if you can get it. All of these will help calm you down.

**SUNSHINE.** It’s SPRINGTIME amid this horror – enjoy it. If you can’t go outside, open the windows and feel it on your face and breath it in. If it’s safe for you to go outside (maybe you live in the country) do it, while of course observing social distance. Go for a walk. Being outdoors, connecting to nature, is hugely calming.

**STEP AWAY FROM SOCIAL MEDIA/THE NEWS:** All it will do will scare you more and make things worse. Turn off the telly and for gods sake avoid the psychopathic digital wild west that is Twitter. Stick to sensible sources like the BBC and the NHS, and limit yourself to short need-to-know bits a day. You’ll feel better immediately. Talk to friends instead - this is physical, not social distancing

**STEP AWAY FROM TERRIBLE COPING MECHANISMS:** They will all translate as BEAR!! to your poor brain. Especially don’t get drunk, especially if you’re alone (BEAR!!!), take drugs (BEAR!!!), stay up all night reading (BEAR!!!), get sucked into conspiracy theories (BEAR!!!), pay attention to ANYTHING Donald Trump says (BEAR!!!). See? Stress levels going up already. Breathe.

**BE KIND**: to yourself and others. Now is not the time to go on a diet. Nor is this the time to start on Proust or makeover your life. You'll probably struggle to concentrate, fail and make yourself feel worse (hat tip Laura Gordon for this bit). Don’t make this more stressful than it already is. Think comfort books, comfort telly, comfort everything. Personally I re-read children's books. Everyone is wobbly, everyone is going to have a meltdown at some point. Understand that if someone is angry or aggressive, then they are also just scared. And eat more cake. Cake makes everything better.

So, there we go. Hopefully a bit less BEAR!!. Now, that kettle should have boiled by now. Go make a nice cup of tea, sit by a window and drink it in this lovely morning sunshine. We are British after all. And save me some cake ❤.(imogen wall)""",,1597970051,{},g29xq5s,True,t3_idmi2r,False,True,t3_idmi2r,/r/Anxiety/comments/idmi2r/if_you_feel_like_you_are_constantly_at_100/g29xq5s/,1597976827,1,True,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,0,[],,,,,

I have had similar things and have tried to explain it to people as the body doing something different to the brain!!! So apparently anxiety feels like there is a tiger ready to attack you when really there isn't. So you can be sat at home or as you say on the phone etc. It sounds like you are just as confused as I was! Its about getting yourself back into a good rhythm, acupuncture has been known to work well (and did for me after my body seized up for a few days after being poorly and getting scared), and reminding yourself that you are safe, surrounded by the people or things that you like and love. The one thing that I used when I first found out was the 4-7-8 breathing technique (breathe in for 4, hold for 7, out for 8), it felt for me like a manual reset, so even if I was panicking there was something I could do to physically calm down. If the 4-7-8 doesn't feel right, remember you do know how to take a deep breath.

Would it be any help if a bot or a human robo-posted some links as a default response, but one that contained links to actually useful resources?

Or would it upset you more, that someone did not bother to respond to your particular specific post?

######Superfast therapy for anxiety and panic:

Fear is meant to be your friend and to protect you, so if it starts hurting, it defeats its own purpose. Don't let it be like that. Make friends with your cautioning brain.
Magic words to constantly repeat: **Stop / wait / hold / no / safe / slow**; **slow down, then slow down some more; look around; there are always options;** it's OK, I'm OK; **discomfort is not danger, what you think is danger is actually only discomfort**; symptoms of nerve defect not really danger; there is no danger; you are safe; there is safety; **don't bully yourself, don't threaten yourself, don't caution yourself**; bullying yourself does not solve anything, it creates more problems; excitement is bad, peaceful is good; why hurt yourself; inanimate objects don't have mind of their own; things cannot be predators; situations don't have mind or purpose; shit happens with everyone; nobody's plans work out; life happens; people are not always wise; repeat trauma is stupid; **play stupid games, win stupid prizes**; support yourself, love yourself, be gentle with yourself; don't be a predator, be peaceful; **don't turn everything into combat; take a step back and pause;** imaginary is virtual, not real, and does not exist outside your head; breathe deep and breathe slowly, relax your body; go with the flow; thoughts come, let them pass; you're allowed to say ""pass, next"" to your thoughts; thoughts are not special or great; **absolutely everyone thinks weird stuff without exceptions**; your brain needs to think weird stuff to identify it as weird; repeat trauma is self-harm, so why?; **if the danger is inanimate, it is harmless; anxiety is all lies**, repeated, convoluted, thorough and convincing lies.

######Everything needed (apart from medication) to reduce anxiety by 80-90% is in here (it's quite a bit and it takes time, but it is worth it):

I feel a bit calmer than I did earlier but still not great. I haven't been taking care of myself. It's hard for me to exercise because I've got CFS, plus a few other conditions as well, but there are other things I could do. For example, I have too much caffeine and sugar, and not enough fruit &amp; veg. Plus, I would benefit from getting back into meditating again but that's been hard because I sleep so badly! To be honest, I am my own worst enemy at times!

I do limit the news and am staying away from Twitter.

As for my online friend, thinking about it, I don't want to be unkind as she's a lovely person, but no-one else, even real life friends, check in with me quite that much! I usually find once a week to be ample. Her messaging me every day at around 6 am with almost exactly the same message does seem rather OCD-ish. I have my own compulsions so I know what it's like.

You're right about feelings of grief and fear. I didn't mention it in my OP, but I lost my husband 7 years ago and have found it really hard to move on since then. I feel like I've been in a state of suspended animation. My parents kind of swooped on me after he passed, and can be very controlling. I don't have much energy but they made sure I spent it all with them - I have to visit them once a week, every week, and talk to Mum every day on the phone. She's seriously ill in hospital at the moment so I don't resent checking in every day, to see how she is, but in a funny sort of way I feel kind of relieved I'm not having to visit every week for a while, if that doesn't sound too awful! But I have found myself behaving in the way I feel that a good daughter should, rather than how I really want to, as an individual.

I didn't stay on it but a month because my new doc at the time wanted me to try Buspar. So, I weaned off the Zac cause I didn't want to take both drugs. My doctor was cool with that. I did the Prozac bridge off of the Pax. Prozac was MUCH worse for me than the Paxil.

You should be fine moving forward. It gets a little worse, then the anxiety starts to slowly fade every day. Stick with it if you can. My old doc told me he had put over 100 patients on SSRIs over the past couple of years and the majority had less problems with Paxil than anything else they tried.

Accountability and having others study with you, or even be in the same room as you as you study will help too. If this isn’t an option then maybe you could try FaceTiming or Skyping someone? If that’s too embarrassing for you, there are also “study with me” videos on YouTube that might help..

Also, try to sit down with your anxiety and really try to find the root of it. More than likely, it’s the fear of failure that’s overwhelming you to the point of not even wanting or being able to begin. Failure is an inevitable part of finding success. If you don’t do a task well, that’s how you learn to do it better the next time.. it’s just part of the process. Don’t let perfectionism cripple you if that’s what you struggle with! Perfection is impossible to achieve without experiencing failure first. If you don’t understand something, don’t be afraid to dissect that misunderstanding into tiny questions. Everything can be understood and achieved, you just might have to break it down first.

The only thing that has worked for me to help in that direction is mediation and exercise, diet and sleep. But meditation is something I have to prioritize for myself so I never get completely fucked in an anxiety spiral. Anyway I hope that can help you even a little.

I was an only child, an anxious child, and always had trouble making friends. I spent my free time with animals, books, computer games... you name it, but I rarely was invited anywhere with peers, and it only grew worse when I hit puberty. Suddenly I was interested in boys, but I was too awkward and quiet, and although it took a little while because I wasn't even cool enough to have access to have alcohol until I was almost 20, pretty soon I was drunk all the time because that was the only way I wasn't so painfully shy and awkward that I could tolerate being around people. 

Fast-forward ten years that I can barely piece together, and I find myself THIRTY but, without the alcohol, that same anxious child with no social skills. And you may think that men have it worse in some ways, because emotional baggage isn't as acceptable, but you also have it better in some ways, because you have a whole lot longer to get your shit together and start a family. 

It wasn't my fault that I was sheltered and awkward and bullied. In fact, even though some days I still feel like I am about six years old, I take pride that I also have the heart of a six-year old. :) I know what it's like to suffer, and just because I haven't been to war or survived cancer or lost a loved one in some horrible accident, my suffering was real, and I don't hate myself for the way that I reacted to it. 

It's not your fault that you have been sheltered, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. You sound intelligent and capable, and you sound ready to challenge yourself and let the world see the best parts of you. The hard part is that people will judge you, but just give yourself credit for being brave!

I give you a lot of credit. Just by how clearly you think and you much you OWN your situation, I'm sure you will be just fine and accomplish whatever you can clearly set your mind on.",,1606786448,{},ge7poq1,False,t3_k1ig5z,False,True,t3_k1ig5z,/r/Anxiety/comments/k1ig5z/i_should_have_grown_up_now_i_am_30_years_old_with/ge7poq1/,1606792879,1,True,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,0,[],,,,,

I'm a parent for one and everything that has to do with school related info is done through Facebook. I almost missed a yearbook pickup which I paid for last year because I didn't see their post in time. It wasn't until one of the heads of the PTA posted ""Last chance for yearbook. Pick up was last week but have a few left"" Didn't see the first post and if I didn't see the second, guess I wasn't going to get one? And so many other examples like that. It is also where parents have each other for resources with the school. Without it, you're just out of the loop (as if it's not clicky already). And that goes for many other pages. Neighborhood page, organization pages, etc. If you aren't seeing it on there, it's like you're behind. Not to mention your family that doesn't get to see you, and friends that don't live nearby. I remember signing up in 2009 and feeling like I finally can be ""in"" on everything happening. Get in touch with those I hadn't seen in a while or where life just makes it difficult to be in touch.

A part of me does want to leave though. I can't stand the constant flow of information that is so all over the place. You will just be scrolling and see back to back posts of so many different things. All within a matter of a minute you could see the following: a news story about covid, a feel good dog story, a post from an acquaintance about their vacation, a story about an abused dog, one about an abused child, a friend complaining about their computer having problems, a friend who does a copy and share about cancer, a friend that posted a bunch of selfies, a story about a shooting, and on and on. Your brain goes from one thing to another. Emotions up and down. It's insane. And honestly probably not healthy in many ways.

But again the problem is that loop. Leaving that loop means being out of it again. Not knowing about school things, community things, work things, life things. The biggest issue is probably the fact that all these use FB to communicate in the first place. That probably needs to change first. But it doesn't see anytime soon.

First of all, how're you doing lately? Hopefully you're doing fine in the middle of this covid mess.

I have performance anxiety in my work, because I felt like I haven't done much at all. But once you've start working on your job, do take note of the small accomplishments that you'll be achieving. I'm still learning on how to not beat myself up too much, and try to appreciate the things that I've done right.

This. Like it or not, you are already that advocate in her life. The fact that you went to your sister to talk about it is proof of that. Your niece needs someone looking out for her, and it sounds like you're doing a pretty good job.

You keep talking about your parents' mistakes, and that's why your sister is the way that she is. She's obviously making some pretty serious mistakes in parenting. But now that you know what your niece is going through, you have to break the chain. If she can't go to therapy, is anything stopping you from listening and being there for her? You probably understand a lot of what she's going through, and if you make yourself available to talk about these things it would probably help her a lot.

It's not overstepping to be a listening ear. It is overstepping to insist that she needs to be in therapy and on medication unless she's the one expressing a desire to go to therapy. Most of us here know that therapy can totally work. But it's not up to you what her parents choose to do for her.

If you can, I would suggest taking lower level high school classes, as a way to boost GPA, it's less stresssful, and you can have more time to apply to colleges, get a job, have extracurriculars and improved social life. You can try to transfer to a class one level lower (think AP to honors, or honors to level normal) if it's midway through the semester. Certainly pressure from family and peers has a huge impact. You might discuss things with a school counselor or friend too.  
Try to relax as much as you can over break. If you need 12+ hrs of sleep, go for it. Take meds regularly.

I cried then I was like, I will join in 5 minutes. I joined back, then I heared 3 of my classmates saying ""she probably got embarrassed or shy"". My heart dropped when I heard that.

1. Most people response to it. For some reason there is a group of people who does not. Reason unknown. May be its the formulation? Not all l-theanine and manafacturer are equal. Hence why I think the very least get it from a reliable company ( now, jarrows, etc) and GMP if possible. Also if you could try getting suntheanine which is basically l-theanine patented because of the way its extracted and has both isomers.
2. i joke that if it works and if you mix it with cofee than I envy you because the first time feeling the sensation of the nice kick + the calmness from ltheanine is going to feel good. Like a hyped up zen master!
3. try smaller doses first, I find that typically formuations are around 200 mg however I find that even 50 mg works well from me, so I just simply take the pill and split it. and take a 150mg in 3 doses split so 50 mg each time througout the day. But of course it varies, some people require a lot more eg &gt; 200mg.
4. also dont froget magnesium this is good stuff although it can cause some GI issues unlike theanine but its really good as well if not for days you want to layoff the theanine to help your body cycle the l-theanine.

There are various scales and assessments used to evaluate for the different types of anxiety and other mental illnesses, they'll ask a bunch of questions about symptoms and severity and frequency, onset etc.

This is the diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, just one of the types of anxiety.

A. Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), ***occurring more days than not for at least 
6 months***, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).

B. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry.

C. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least 
some symptoms having been present for more days than not for the past 6 months):

Note: Only one item required in children.

1. Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge.

2. Being easily fatigued.

3. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank.

4. Irritability.

5. Muscle tension.

6. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep).

D. The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, 
occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, 
a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).

F. The disturbance is not better explained by another medical disorder (e.g., anxiety or worry about 
having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anxiety disorder [social phobia], 
contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation from attachment 
figures in separation anxiety disorder, reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, 
gaining weight in anorexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived 
appearance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety disorder, 
or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder).


A panic attack includes at least four of these symptoms (as you can see above, panic attacks are NOT a requirement for GAD - panic disorder is a separate diagnosis and some people do have panic attacks, but don't have them frequently or severely enough to be classed as ""panic disorder"" - panic disorder also has its own criteria that must be met, which is as follows:

A. The individual experiences recurrent unexpected panic attacks, which are abrupt feelings of intense fear or discomfort that reach great heights within minutes, during a time in which at least four of the following symptoms occur:

- Palpitations, pounding heart or quickened heart beat
- Abnormal sweating
- Trembling or shaking
- Instances of shortness of breath or feeling smothered
- Feelings of choking
- Chest pain or discomfort
- Nausea or abdominal pain
- Dizziness, unsteadiness, light-headedness or faintness
- Chills or hot flashes
- Paresthesia (numbness or tingling sensations)
- Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (feeling detached from his or her self)
- Fear of losing control or “going crazy”
- Fear of death

B. One or more of the attacks were followed by a month (or longer) of one or both of the following:

- Persistent worry about having more panic attacks and/or their consequences (e.g., having a heart attack)

- A significant abnormal change in behavior in response to the attacks, such as ones intended to avoid unfamiliar situations.

C. The disturbance cannot be attributed to the physiological effects of a substance, such as a drug or medication, or another medical condition.

D. The disturbance cannot be better explained by another mental disorder, such as social anxiety disorder or specific phobia, which may involve panic attacks.",,1614116453,{},goieyy0,False,t3_lqtdtw,False,True,t3_lqtdtw,/r/Anxiety/comments/lqtdtw/im_not_self_diagnosing_just_asking_are_symptoms/goieyy0/,1614277875,2,True,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,0,[],,,,,

Like she has some chaotic vibes, and is messy and doesn't have much trouble speaking up for her needs from my experience.

I don't intend on living here long, I pay month to month so it's no lease, I really want to live alone because I've only ever had shared living experiences and I NEED to experience having full control over decor, lighting, sound, cleanliness, clutter levels, etc.

The favors do drive me crazy, and she interrupts when my partner is over all the time. Like just because I'm in the common area doesn't mean I want to talk. She's the type to be like ""omg you have to see this"" and make me come over to look at a picture of some random ass baby and I'm like ""neat"" but inside I'm like ""I don't care, that baby is kinda ugly, you just interrupted me, aghghgg""

That sounds TRRRIBLE, the spit... I am so grossed out thinking if it, I'm so sorry you have to deal with that. I don't blame you for getting nervous with her being near food. Also sorry for the coughing annoyance, personally I get jumpy about it just because of covid.

It makes sense, she's not doing that on purpose and maybe something like the way it sounds when you scratch your head or how fidgety you are during a movie or something is annoying to them but it's all subconscious and you can't expect people to change stuff like that. It would be like telling someone with a lisp to talk different.

Well I am not good at hiding my feelings unless I'm literally hiding my whole self (being in my room all day). If I'm in a bad mood, whether it has to do with her or not, she feels the need to call attention to it and be like ""I could tell something was up, you had a vibe"" and it's like she verbally vibe checks me and I just want to have my feelings in peace without being called out for emoting, especially when we are not close enough that I would want to share the cause anyways. If she does something big that bugs me, I will speak up, like asking for her to take out the recycling I'd it's been a while since she's done it, or to clean some clutter soni can use the table. Honestly, a lot of this stuff is not specific to her but just comes down to I hate having a roommate regardless of who it is, at least that's my current standing.

Going to a psychiatrist and starting meds was the best decision I ever made. Every person's experience is different, I can only share my own. The hardest thing about psychotropic medication is that it is usually not a quick fix, more like a scavenger hunt. You have to find the ""right"" medication for you, the one that works for you is unique to your disorder, genes and brain chemistry. If you take the wrong one, it may work but have intolerable side effects or may in fact actually make your anxiety worse even after the first few weeks of adjustment have passed (some only temporarily worsen anxiety, but that stops after a few weeks and then it improves past baseline).

I have GAD, panic disorder, trichotillomania and phobias. I'd been in therapy for about nine months before I took the plunge and gone through two therapists. Both of my therapists were upfront with me after I'd been in treatment for a while, like ""in your case therapy is not likely to be sufficient"", they told me they could only be so helpful when anxiety is very severe. Does therapy help me manage my anxiety? Yes. Does it help me *stop* it? Hell no. I wanted my anxiety *gone* and that's not something CBT is capable of, that's not what it's designed to do. It just teaches you to cope with your illness.

Because of that, on therapy alone it's basically an endless, futile, fruitless fight between my coping skills and reframing and whatnot...and my brain. My anxiety has a *huge* impact on my functioning. Therapy, exercise, meditation, all those things have their place, but they also have their *limits*. It's not a panacea. None of that shit could stop the infinite storm of anxiety in my brain, the ruminating, the panic attacks, the nightmares and insomnia and compulsive hair pulling to the point of bleeding. Medication was the missing piece for me. I work at a mental health agency IRL so I don't have the fear of treatment and medication that some seem to. Medication and therapy combined are clinically proven to be the most effective treatment for anxiety.

I take Citalopram/Celexa and it's magic. I have zero irrational anxiety - the sickening pit of dread is gone. I also take hydroxyzine for insomnia and for occasional panic attacks with success. I have widespread brain damage which may contribute since any damage can cause mental illness, but whatever is wrong with my brain that causes this anxiety and panic - Celexa fixes it. It's basically magic. Sometimes there's a biological cause, a difference in your brain, and medication gets to the root of the problem, and therapy and lifestyle changes only help manage the symptoms.

SSRIs typically take 4-6 weeks to work and for the first few weeks, Citalopram did nothing. Nothing good, nothing bad. And then all of a sudden one day it *worked*, I realized...I'm *calm*. I'd forgotten what that felt like. It had been sixteen years since I'd known that feeling. And I'm going on two months and that feeling has persisted. It's *beautiful.* I feel *normal.* I feel like *me* and I'd forgotten who that was, the person who isn't constantly hounded and crippled by anxiety and panic. I still get stressed in situations that would cause a normal, non-anxious person anxiety, but the constant, sickening pit of dread is gone thanks to my medication. I can't say enough good things. The day I went to the psychiatrist for the first time is the best day of my life, no contest. 

I didn't think this was possible. I'd been  in therapy and while it helped with behavioral things, like coping with panic attacks and distracting myself, choosing behavioral alternatives to pulling my hair to self-sooth, therapy alone didn't and *couldn't* help as much as I wanted. It did nothing for my irrational, panicked brain - because that's just the nature of my brain, fundamentally. It's a disorder. I didn't know that *calm* was an achievable state for me anymore. I began therapy after a breakdown during a panic attack...I tried to amputate my fingers and realized there was no more denying it, this was obviously a disorder (turns out, a lot of them actually) and not an unfortunate assortment of flaws and personality quirks like I'd spent fifteen years desperately trying to convince myself. Starting medication was easily the best decision of my life and had a huge impact on my happiness, my functioning, every aspect of my life. I was constantly making myself sick with worry over the *stupidest* things, and even over absolutely nothing, and I knew it was stupid but I *couldn't stop*.

I once had to bail on most of my accounting final because the professor banned us from leaving the room for any reason and I suddenly *had* to go - I threw the exam on her desk and bolted from the room as fast as I could, barely made it in time. I've puked in my fair share of trash cans and bushes.

Peppermint or ginger tea can help. Anxious nausea is typically due to an overproduction of acid so antacids can help.

[],,larki18,,,[],,,,text,t2_mvl8z,False,False,[],"I have widespread brain damage resulting from an acquired brain injury (ABI), bilateral intraventricular brain hemorrhages as a very young child, grade 3 and 4 (4 is the worst possible). Naturally, brain damage makes me high risk for all sorts of mental illnesses, including depression and anxiety. I seem to have ended up with a bunch of fear-related conditions - GAD, panic disorder, phobias, and trichotillomania which is a misguided attempt to cope and self-soothe. My therapist has been zero help for my GAD. CBT has been helpful for learning to cope with panic attacks and reduce my hair pulling, but not for GAD...when you're unreasonably anxious about everything and nothing and you know it but you can neither stop it nor ignore it, there's no rationalizing it away. Medication was the biggest help for my GAD, not therapy, the only thing that treats the root of the problem. Sometimes therapy and meditation and coping skills are just band-aids, they just treat the symptoms.

Going to a psychiatrist and starting meds was the best decision I ever made. Every person's experience is different, I can only share my own. The hardest thing about psychotropic medication is that it is usually not a quick fix, more like a scavenger hunt. You have to find the ""right"" medication for you, the one that works for you is unique to your disorder, genes and brain chemistry. If you take the wrong one, it may work but have intolerable side effects or may in fact actually make your anxiety worse even after the first few weeks of adjustment have passed (some only temporarily worsen anxiety, but that stops after a few weeks and then it improves past baseline).

I'd been in therapy for about nine months before I took the plunge and gone through two therapists. Both of my therapists were upfront with me after I'd been in treatment for a while, like ""in your case therapy is not likely to be sufficient"", they told me they could only be so helpful when anxiety is very severe. Does therapy help me manage my anxiety? Yes. Does it help me *stop* it? Hell no. I wanted my anxiety *gone* and that's not something CBT is capable of, that's not what it's designed to do. It just teaches you to cope with your illness.

Because of that, on therapy alone it's basically an endless, futile, fruitless fight between my coping skills and reframing and whatnot...and my brain. My anxiety has a *huge* impact on my functioning. Therapy, exercise, meditation, all those things have their place, but they also have their *limits*. It's not a panacea. None of that shit could stop the infinite storm of anxiety in my brain, the ruminating, the panic attacks, the nightmares and insomnia and compulsive hair pulling to the point of bleeding. Medication was the missing piece for me. I work at a mental health agency IRL so I don't have the fear of treatment and medication that some seem to. Medication and therapy combined are clinically proven to be the most effective treatment for anxiety.

I take Citalopram/Celexa and it's magic. I have zero irrational anxiety - the sickening pit of dread is gone. I also take hydroxyzine for insomnia and for occasional panic attacks with success. Whatever is wrong with my brain that causes this intolerable anxiety and panic - Celexa fixes it. It's basically magic. Sometimes there's a biological cause, a difference in your brain, and medication gets to the root of the problem, and therapy and lifestyle changes only help manage the symptoms. 

No amount of CBT in the world could do what Celexa does for me. The only problems I still have are my trichotillomania and uncontrollable nightmares, both of which have been my constant companion for sixteen years now. I have nightmares all night, every night, and wake up every 60-90 minutes usually in a cold sweat, shaking or crying, I've woken myself up by screaming, I've been convinced someone is in my room standing over me. They even reoccur throughout the night, when I wake up and calm down enough to go back to sleep, the dreams will often either reoccur or simply continue where they left off. I am so tired of it. I do not want to go to sleep. I just recently had my very first good dreams in sixteen years and I suppose I can thank my Celexa for that (honestly a miracle), but before that I couldn't remember the last dream I had that wasn't a horribly disturbing nightmare. Therapy was useless for it. I found nothing to help. I am considering asking my psychiatrist about Prazosin, a medication used for nightmares in people with PTSD. 

SSRIs typically take 4-6 weeks to work and for the first few weeks, Citalopram did nothing. Nothing good, nothing bad. And then all of a sudden one day it *worked*, I realized...I'm *calm*. I'd forgotten what that felt like. It had been sixteen years since I'd known that feeling. And I'm going on four months and that feeling has persisted. It's *beautiful.* I feel *normal.* I feel like *me* and I'd forgotten who that was, the person who isn't constantly hounded and crippled by anxiety and panic. I still get stressed in situations that would cause a normal, non-anxious person anxiety, but the constant, sickening pit of dread is gone thanks to my medication. I can't say enough good things about my experience with Celexa. The day I went to the psychiatrist for the first time is the best day of my life, no contest. 

I didn't think this was possible. Let me repeat that: I *work* at a mental health agency, and I was so far down the hole that there was no light. I'd been in therapy and while it helped with behavioral things, like coping with panic attacks and distracting myself, choosing behavioral alternatives to pulling my hair to self-sooth, therapy alone didn't and *couldn't* help as much as I wanted. It did nothing for my irrational, panicked brain - because that's just the nature of my brain, fundamentally. It's a disorder. I didn't know that *calm* was an achievable state for me anymore. I began therapy after a breakdown during a panic attack...I tried to amputate my fingers and realized there was no more denying it, this was obviously a disorder (turns out, a lot of them actually) and not an unfortunate assortment of flaws and personality quirks like I'd spent fifteen years desperately trying to convince myself. Starting medication was easily the best decision of my life and had a huge impact on my happiness, my functioning, every aspect of my life. I was constantly making myself sick with worry over the *stupidest* things, and even over absolutely nothing, and I knew it was stupid but I *couldn't stop*.

When we have an anxiety attack, its basically the result of a snowball effect of stress. You've accumulated so much anxiety and stress that your body cannot take it any more so for me the healthier thing is just to let my body get it all out. Kinda like vomiting when you have a stomach bug.

[],,OwlLights,,,[],,,,text,t2_132pcxh5,False,False,[],"Dude, I feel you. I got my license when I was almost 19, I went on my first date at the beginning of this year. (I’m 20, now.) I had to almost break up with the guy afterwards because I got such bad anxiety thinking about our relationship and the unknown future. It (the anxiety) was effecting my job that I loved, and I didn’t want a guy to come in the middle of that. Like, I had an anxiety attack that last for like 30-45 minutes and I literally could not do anything but sit there and wait it out. I knew that before I could go back to dating that I’d need to get better at managing my anxiety before I could go back to dating. (Not saying that you should do that, but that was my experience.)

I also struggle with depression, to which I say that anxiety and depression are a special kind of mental hell. A couple of things that really help me during this time:
1. Talking to someone about what’s going on in your head.
I highly recommend seeing a counselor or a psychiatrist (or a medical professional in mental health, doctor, psychologist, etc.), to which I didn’t think that talking about my issues and experiences in life would help me, but I honestly look forward to seeing and talking with my counselor. A benefit to that is they can offer advice about how to handle anxiety/depression. Breathing exercises, grounding techniques, common sense filters, etc. Super helpful for me. The someone could also be a friend who you can talk to about this. I have a couple of friends who have experienced what I’m experiencing that I can be like, “here’s what happened to today, what do you think?” It doesn’t have to be someone who understands mental health, but it certainly helps. 

2. Find a routine. 
This is necessary for you and your mental health. Even if you think routines are stupid, it seriously helps. And it doesn’t have to be this elaborate set schedule or ten step process, it could be as simple as getting up and making a cup of coffee or tea, or changing into different clothes, taking a shower, etc. Because with this, your “normal” is not a what is tangible right now, because we live in a very different time of life. 

3. Physical activity. 
You said that you were working out at home, that’s fantastic keep doing that. Something that helped me was going on walks /outside/. It really improves my mood if I’m having a rough day. Or if I don’t want to go out to the world (I have social anxiety too, yay) I walked and/or ran on a treadmill at home. I much prefer going outside and getting out of the house. 

4. Find a hobby or a distraction to get your mind off everything. 
When I was younger, I coped with my anxiety and depression by reading books. It was one of the best things that I did for me. I would always be reading books, and still prefer it over watching TV. But now I have no motivation to pick up a book and start reading, so I’ve been gravitating to videos, whether that be TV, Movies, or YouTube. If I start reading, I’m usually fine, but it’s just actually starting is the hard part. (Just try not to watch something that may be triggering for you).


One day this will all be over. One day your anxiety and depression will be much more manageable. But, you have to be there to see it. Stay strong, it’ll be okay. 

TL;DR: 1. Talk to someone. 2. Find a routine in the midst of chaos. 3. Physical activity, preferably outside. 4. Find a hobby or a new interest to distract yourself from all the things. 5. This will end, and it’ll be okay.",,1589159255,{},fq863jj,False,t3_ghap58,False,True,t3_ghap58,/r/Anxiety/comments/ghap58/how_to_not_feel_depressed_and_suicidal_due_to/fq863jj/,1589163226,1,True,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,0,[],,,,,

It makes it hard to focus, I feel like my head is stuffed with cotton balls and it’s hard to think about the positive aspects of life. It’s important to remember, you are young. Think about how long it has taken to reach 26 and know it will take that exact amount of time for the next 26 years and the 26 years after that. Sometimes I think about my grandma who is 87 and think that she was my age (32) in 1965, before the moon landing! I have to remember all that happened between 1965 and now and it seems like an eternity of changes and experiences. Many people say life is short, that’s not entirely true. Our perception of life changes but remember that time hasn’t changed. A year now is the same exact length of time as a year when you were 10.

I was actually in a very similar situation to yours. I was living with my 3 roommates at college, but decided to go home at the end of April because I felt trapped in that apartment, and it was only worsening my anxiety. 

My mom is also high risk, which made me reluctant to want to go back home, but my mom was insisting. I am worried about her health, but ultimately it’s her decision on whether she wanted me back in, and she did! 

In terms of anxiety, I do my absolute best to keep my mind off of covid-19 related matters. I was having trouble sleeping at my apartment and would be incredibly restless, but at home now, I take long walks or skateboard around the neighborhood, play with my dogs, and I’m currently self teaching piano. I think getting some solid exercise during the day is super helpful (even just walking), and finding a hobby that challenges your brain helps sleeping at night be a bit easier :) 

In terms of the higher blood pressure. I too have slightly high blood pressure, mostly from unhealthy eating, and I vaped nicotine for about a year of my life, and just recently quit. If you’re able to, try to eat healthy-ish type meals, that are a bit lower in sodium :) that combo’d with light exercise and drinking plenty of water has helped me keep the BP down.

A Chinese laboratory has been developing a drug it believes has the power to bring the coronavirus pandemic to a halt.

The outbreak first emerged in China late last year before spreading across the world, prompting an international race to find treatments and vaccines.

A drug being tested by scientists at China's prestigious Peking University could not only shorten the recovery time for those infected, but even offer short-term immunity from the virus, researchers say.

Sunney Xie, director of the university's Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, told AFP that the drug has been successful at the animal testing stage.

""When we injected neutralising antibodies into infected mice, after five days the viral load was reduced by a factor of 2,500,"" said Xie.

""That means this potential drug has (a) therapeutic effect.""

The drug uses neutralising antibodies -- produced by the human immune system to prevent the virus infecting cells -- which Xie's team isolated from the blood of 60 recovered patients.

Patients who test positive for the coronavirus weeks after recovering from Covid-19 probably aren’t capable of transmitting the infection, research from South Korea shows.

Scientists from the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied 285 Covid-19 survivors who had tested positive for the coronavirus after their illness had apparently resolved, as indicated by a previous negative test result. The so-called re-positive patients weren’t found to have spread any lingering infection, and virus samples collected from them couldn’t be grown in culture, indicating the patients were shedding non-infectious or dead virus particles.

The findings, reported late Monday, are a positive sign for regions looking to open up as more patients recover from the pandemic that has sickened at least 4.8 million people. The emerging evidence from South Korea suggests those who have recovered from Covid-19 present no risk of spreading the coronavirus when physical distancing measures are relaxed.

I see myself in everything you said. I also have GAD and OCD intrusive thoughts. I'm also on Luvox.

First of all, be ready for recovery to take a long time. It's just how the brain works, it takes a lot of commitment and hard work to change the brain. So it's quite normal that you don't see a huge improvement right off the bat, but since you're committed to getting better, a couple of years you'll look back at this moment and think: wow, I was in a really bad place and look at me now!

The medication will not interfere with the blood tests so I don't see why you should ween off the medication if you're seeing improvement, even if it's small. My psychiatrist told me that Luvox doesn't have any permanent positive effects if it's not taken for at least 6 months, that's how long it takes to see change in the brain.

With that said, request the thyroid tests and consult with a doctor if there's anything else you should be checking that could be the root of depression and anxiety issues. If the tests show an issue, make another plan then, but for now I'd stick with the meds.

Stick with therapy, the meds do help but to see consistent, lasting improvements you have to put it the work to alter thought patterns. Try mindfulness and breathing exercises, it's hard to being but once you get the hang of it you really learn how to calm yourself down.

Try to take a small moment to just appreciate that you are here seeking help, that you took the step and acknowledged you want to get better and are willing to try.

As for the interview not going well, hey it happens! Now you can learn from it. What made you anxious? Why? What helps you when you get anxious? Why? What allows you to center yourself when you are stressed? Is it counting items in the room? Breathing? Pausing?

First step is acknowledging you are anxious. The next step is determining why. The third is usually finding out how to slow yourself down and bring yourself back to center.



One solution for next time could be, ""oh, wow that's a great question. Let me quick come up with a game plan in my head as to how I would approach that as I often like to think things through before I speak.""

Vaccine trials normally have a 90 per cent failure rate and can take a decade or more to develop. Seventeen years after SARS emerged in 2003, there is still no vaccine against it.

But there is real hope that COVID-19 is different. And with thousands of brilliant scientists working hard on developing vaccines and treatments to fight the novel coronavirus that has turned our lives upside-down, it’s quite possible that we could see a vaccine that works by early next year.

A Halifax lab has joined the fight.

A promising vaccine trial is being held by the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology in Halifax. Developed by CanSino Biologics of China, the vaccine has already undergone trials in China, with encouraging results. Trials there are into a second phase with hundreds of volunteers, but the Canadian trial will be an initial phase with a small number of subjects.

Agreements with the Canadian government will permit the vaccine to go into production and distribution rapidly if it proves effective. It will be the first Canadian trial for a COVID-19 vaccine.


Then there’s the Moderna vaccine, which made noise earlier this month in the U.S.

Moderna’s vaccine technology is new, using genetic material from the virus called mRNA, and has never produced an approved vaccine. Nevertheless, the company hopes to conduct a trial with thousands of healthy participants in late summer and have a vaccine ready for production by the end of 2020.

That’s only two of almost 100 trials being worked on all over the world in an unprecedented scientific race to beat the virus. Multiple vaccines will be needed in order to satisfy the demand. Billions of doses will eventually be required for a worldwide inoculation program, and that doesn’t get manufactured and distributed overnight.

There’s enormous pressure to act fast, with 5.5 million confirmed cases and almost 350,000 deaths worldwide caused by the virus, which is still in its first wave in many places. The economic blow has been severe, shutting down millions of businesses and leading to a recession that is likely worse than the financial crisis of 2008-09.

One reason scientists are so hopeful is that the virus does not appear to mutate to the extent that researchers feared. A New York Times story last week reported that it has proven to be “clumsy prey” that is easy to attack because its rate of mutation is slow.

And early work appears to indicate that the vaccines under study are safe, which is one of the reasons the trials are moving so quickly.

All of which is welcome good news to a world weary of illness, death and economic hardship.

In the general sense, I started to see a therapist. I realized the life I was living was really constricting, miserable, and life-draining. 

In regards to situations, I try to get myself in a different physical setting if I’m able. Preferably outside (as long as the weather is nice) and try to ground myself (focus on what I’m physically feeling, seeing, etc.). Relaxing or motivational music is also helpful to me. I also like to journal. I used to journal my frantic, anxious thoughts, but now I tend to just journal rational ones, as if I’m talking back to my anxiety. I find it powerful and influential to see my thoughts actually written down in front of me.   Other things include watching a funny tv show, playing with my dog, and forcing myself to dance and sing to music. 

If I can’t get myself out of a situation..... well, that can be tough. this past week I was really really anxious but I was in the backseat of a car and couldn’t get out.

New Zealand has had no new cases of COVID-19 for five consecutive days

New Zealand no longer has a single person being treated in a hospital for the coronavirus, health officials there announced Wednesday, as the country celebrates five consecutive days of no new cases of the virus.

Ashley Bloomfield, the head of the country's health ministry, told reporters that the last patient with a confirmed case of COVID-19 had been discharged from Auckland's Middlemore Hospital.

""I think this is the first time, at least probably in a couple of months, that we haven't had somebody in hospital,"" he said, ""so that's another good position to be in.""

There are just 21 remaining active cases of COVID-19 among New Zealand's 4.8 million people, Bloomfield said.

The country has had a total of 1,504 confirmed or probable cases of the virus and only 21 deaths.

""We are really well-placed, and we are making good progress,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a Facebook Livestream on Wednesday.

[],,iamnotbart,,,[],,,,text,t2_5cy84ix6,False,False,[],"The theory behind it (I'm not a Dr., but I will play one on Reddit) is that when we face certain trauma in our lives.. even when it happened at a very young age.. those memories get stuck in our short term memory, and so we are constantly affected by them. For example, I've dealt with a lot of bullying as a kid, was beaten up a few times.. really humiliated other times. For me, those memories were stuck in my short term memory.. probably as a defense mechanism. So whenever I found myself in social situations with my peers..like how school was.. it would trigger the fight or flight mechanism in me.. and I would consider the situation a threat.. even though the people I'm with now as an adult actually like me.

It's like.. if you were constantly being attacked by bears.. your mind keeps those memories fresh for your so you are always on the lookout for bears. The problem is if those memories don't leave your short term memory.. they stick with you and constantly affect you.

The theory of sleep is that your mind will process all of your short term memories and put them into long term memory. Think about this, have you ever had something stressful happen to you during the day, but once you woke up the next day, you felt a lot better about it? It's because those stressful short term memories were placed into long term memory where they don't affect you as much.

The way EMDR works is it tries to jump start the mind to put those traumatic memories into long term memory where it won't affect you as much. During REM sleep, the right and left brain will alternate back and forth.. which is why your eyes will jump around when you sleep. When you use the vibrating paddles, or you follow the person's finger left and right.. they are trying to trigger the REM process in your mind while you think about the traumatic memory. They are trying to get your mind to process those bad memories into long term storage were they belong. 

It took me about a year, mostly because I became numb to my emotions in general after dealing with that for so long as a kid (almost every day for 6 years) but I thought about one memory during  a session that made me break down and cry. I was fine literally 5 minutes prior, I was actually in a good mood that day. For the next few days I was nothing but sad and angry about the whole situation I've dealt with as a kid. About that, the anxiety was  about 95% gone. Every once and a while it comes up.. but to be honest, I feel like a completely different person now. I feel like the person I was meant to be without all of the anxiety.

EMDR is not nonsense, even though it doesn't seem like it at first, it's actually a very technical way to get your mind to do specific things to help you process trauma. When you take meds, all you are doing is trying to help you deal with those short term memories, but they are still there. It's like taking pain meds for bad knees, when you might need surgery to fix the underlying problem. 

I would say, try EMDR if you can, it changed my life.",,1585492309,{},flu0eyf,True,t3_fqycuu,False,True,t1_fltdfrx,/r/Anxiety/comments/fqycuu/how_to_deal_with_regret/flu0eyf/,1585492311,1,True,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,0,,,,,,

It's all fine and dandy thinking about things that you want to happen to your life, but what about the things that you don't? It creates a spiral. I think it's unhealthy for people who have anxiety, and it is also unproven. LOA is not science, just remember that. Yes, there is a certain effect where if you are looking out for something, you suddenly see it a lot more, but that's down to the mind's own filtering abilities. For example, when I got a new car of a certain model, I'd see that model more than I did before, because it was relevant to me - suddenly that thing was a part of my life, so I paid attention to it more.

I know this isn’t an answer you’ll like, but a common way to get over it is to face it, over and over and over again, until it’s not inciting a debilitating reaction from you. This is extremely difficult because the physical sensations, like the dizziness, are so unpleasant that we all do our best to go out of our way to avoid them. I mean, why would we WANT to make ourselves miserable? I know it’s much easier said than done, giving advice is simple compared to following it, but there is some science regarding the exposure therapy. 

My advice, not like im a doctor or anything, is to practice being in these places for very small increments of time. Go on a higher level and either walk around the floor or have a seat. Build up the amount of time spent there. Document how you feel before, during and after. Reward yourself afterwards even if you think you “failed”. That’s a big one, I don’t seem to find things successful unless they’re PERFECT. My husband always tells me “don’t let perfect get in the way of better” and that’s true. Just focus on improvements, that’s really all you can do.

As for anxiety being worse after getting off, my best advice is to spend your time on the meds looking for a good therapist that you trust. Once you have that, you can start to make a plan for how to manage once you're off the meds. My personal experience was that my anxiety didn't spike or rebound after getting off the meds, but I was in therapy at the time. 

I went back on meds about a year later for personal reasons that were more related to depression that was fueling my anxiety, but I likely would not have done so otherwise. 

If you're super worried, start small. Break the pills in half and do half doses for the first week or two. My PCP recommended this for me.

Bedtime seems perfect for my anxiety to creep in. After a while, I’ve realised that it happens at this time because there’s nothing else left for me to do (apart from lying there with my racing mind and inconvenient worrying thoughts. GREAT!).

But guys, having read some of the comments here, I think it’s worth sharing a few things I came across during my anxiety journey. I don’t know what stage you are at yours, but I hope this can shed some light and give you some reassurance.

The first time a doctor told me I was having panic attacks (and not a heart attack) was three years ago. At the time, I had them pretty bad. Multiple times a day, every single day, for weeks. I just couldn’t get my head around how the hell I ended up going through that. I was mentally and physically exhausted, tired of crying. I looked at myself in the mirror and I saw a stranger. I asked my mum to take me to the ER multiple times because I “needed to know I was OK” (sounds familiar?). In other words, I was a mess. If you’re feeling like this, I want you to know that you are stronger than you think you are. And I mean this literally.

I know we worry a lot about our physical symptoms when they show up. But I can  tell you, as a Scientist, that I know how our bodies work pretty damn well. And honestly, they are amazing! Every discomfort that you’re feeling (sweaty hands, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, shaking) is a product of millions of years of evolution, and all of them combined are part of a perfectly well-tuned system that your body activates to get you out of trouble when you enter “fight or flight” mode. We’re no longer hunters in the middle of a dangerous forest like our ancestors but this is a primitive response that gets easily triggered in sight of danger. This brings me to the core issue here: your mental health.

Our brains are extremely powerful and each one of us have different triggers for anxiety. As bizarre as this can sound, anxiety is the one thing that will keep you alive in a real life-threatening situation. So if you have it, at the end of the day, it means that this vital feature in your body is working. What you don’t want though, is to experience anxiety in the absence of threat. And that takes me back to that initial, core point: your mental health. 

I struggled for a long time to accept this, but if there’s anyone that can do their very best to take you out of this situation, it’s you. And I don’t mean this in a way that takes your support network or doctor for granted (absolutely not!). What I mean is, only you can recognise your triggers and work on them. For me, it’s “big life changes”. Three years ago I had graduated, was getting married and about to start a life in a completely different country. Interestingly, my mum mentioned that I had similar shortness of breath episodes when I was 10. That was when my grandad passed away, and I was moving to a different school. Right now, it’s working from home, away from my family and friends, and in the middle of a pandemic. 

In my honest opinion, the best way to look after your mental health is to take the time and process what the voices in your head are telling you. Don’t fight them, just listen to them. Say everything the are saying to you out loud. Then ask yourself: Does this make sense? Break every thought into little pieces and scrutinise them. If they come back, do it again. This habit will eventually build your confidence. The best thing I had against anxiety when I needed help the most was knowledge. For example, a very good book that I can recommend is “Overcoming Anxiety” from Helen Kennerley. It’s very easy to understand and has excellent exercises to help you get to the root of what triggers your anxiety.

Now talking about tips, I find ASMR videos really helpful. The Calm app is also amazing. On both of these you can find tailored sessions to help you during panic attacks. Another two things that have massively improved my sleep are: exercise (any time of the day, in or out of the house) and a warm bath (before bed). They guarantee me a decent night of sleep on the bad days, and a perfect one on the good days. Also, reducing your screen time! I can’t emphasise this enough. Use your social media wisely, set limits for yourself and strictly follow them. If you’re in bed and start feeling shaky, a good way to slowly stop it is tensioning all your muscles for a bit and then relaxing them. Do it repeatedly. It’s important to accept that you’re having panic attacks as well. After a couple of episodes you’ll be able to feel them coming. Finally, make sure you’re belly breathing when taking deep breaths. This will significantly reduce your shortness of breath and quickly bring your heart rate to normal! It works wonders.

I know this was a super long post but I hope it gives other anxious minds like mine a little help and a little hope! Be kind to yourself, try as hard as you can to focus on the present and live one day at a time.

[],,phonetic_luck,,,[],,,,text,t2_6fqxrv3h,False,False,[],"Sometimes being compassionate with yourself is really all that is needed. I've found through personal experience and experience with many others that being critical of yourself only leads to self hatred which further perpetuates the hurt. When we learn to have compassion for ourselves and allow ourselves to feel, give our body what it needs, and understand that it is ok to have ""bad"" days, age regress, take a day off, not be a ""real"" adult, etc that we learn to love ourselves and from there comes positive change and growth. I personally believe our value comes from being human and that humans are innately good and that we only do bad things out of hurt, hate (for self or others), sadness, because we dont know what else to do, etc. But that our ""bad"" actions are really just stemming from desires for good. 
  
For example, I also used to self harm. Self harming though a ""bad"" behavior was done out of my desire to feel something other than pain and out of a hatred for myself that I felt sadness. I wanted to feel happiness and love and tons of other feelings other than sadness and anxiety and self hatred. Having a desire for happiness is a good desire. However, the more I hated myself for feeling sad or self harming the more I self harmed. I wasnt able to stop self harming until I was able to give myself compassion for feeling anxious and sad. I allowed myself to feel those emotions and do things that comforted my inner child such as take a day off and just draw or cry while hugging my childhood stuffed animal. The minute I had compassion and chose to love my inner child the more I began to love myself and no longer had a desire to self harm. From there came a lot of growth and realization and insight into many other actions and behaviours in my life. I also journaled through all of this and it helped me keep track of my thoughts as they grew and changed. 
 
I understand your desire for what a typical adult life may look like but I don't believe adult life is the same for everyone. It looks different for everybody. And like you said, going to try to live a typical adult life may bring you more harm right now. Life truly looks different for everyone and having compassion for where we are right now is what truly allows us to be where we need to be. For example, right now I'm also not working and as much as I may want to be seen as a contributing, functioning adult, I know that due to the world right now and my anxiety that I shouldn't be working. I have been practicing compassion towards what my body is needing and it has really lowered my anxiety and allowed me to grow so that I will be ready to start working when the world starts opening back up. 
  
Also, if you are interested in these concepts I would suggest looking into Alfred Adler. He was a psychologist who believed that we all have an innate need to belong and feel significant. He discusses lots of stuff on this. Also, the holistic psychologist on instagram has a lot of great tools and resources for listening to our inner child.

My advice is learning your triggers and do your best to stay away from them when possible. Some employers frown upon frequent breaks but it wouldn’t hurt to ask or speak to a manager you trust. They may be able to accommodate you. If you’re triggered by hot conditions and tight spaces fast food may not be the best job for we you. You’re very young and it may take a while to figure things out and that’s ok. Trying to force yourself into a position that triggers you will make you burn out fast.

During his departure, co-workers held signs that said, “We Love You, Dr. Pruden — Heroes Work Here.”
Pruden, a 70-year-old Teaneck resident, who was in charge of emergency preparedness at the hospital, issued a brief statement.
“Your care made the difference for me and enabled me to beat this virus,” Pruden said. “I implore every health care worker across New Jersey to keep the faith and stay strong. You are giving everything — for people just like me. You are truly our heroes.”

I had a loss of appetite on it at times but that was a temporary side effect.

So if you want to gain weight, probably a different medication would be a better choice over Prozac.

One thing that’s a little complicated with antidepressants and weight gain is that you have the effects of mental illness on weight as another factor. So if a medication improves someone’s depression it would hopefully impact both over and under eating. So it’s hard to say in the studies, did they gain weight from the meds or gain weight from their depression improving?

Prozac is also approved for bulimia and used off label for binge eating, so I would say it’s typically a better choice for those who overeat over those who undereat.

I think there’s not conclusive evidence on one SSRI being superior to others, so I think most doctors will choose the first one based on the side effect profile. Thought Lexapro, Zoloft, and Prozac seem to be most common first choices to me.

So these talks about social distancing even lasting through the fall seem ridiculous to me.  You can't simply continue to have a functioning society if you do this.  This would only lead us to a police/surveillance state or mass economic collapse.

To combat this Harvard study, there was a study by ETH Zurich (a public research university) that concluded the spread of the virus (in Switzerland) began slowing down **prior** to the lockdown measures, simply from general hygiene measures \[behind a paywall... sorry [https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/ansteckungsraten-flachten-bereits-vor-dem-lockdown-ab-809893127675](https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/ansteckungsraten-flachten-bereits-vor-dem-lockdown-ab-809893127675)\].

So I never had super severe OCD, but enough to significantly impact my life. Like I very much understand that OCD is hell lol.

I feel like my obsessions and compulsions are reduced. Some of my compulsions seem sort of ridiculous now lol. It’s weird how certain things that would have previously induced some degree of OCD meltdown are just...fine now. Like I had a really hard time grocery shopping before because I had all these “rules” and now I just...go shopping like a normal person? I can just throw things away without my OCD convincing me that I’m a bad person if I do?

Also noticed I had an easier time focusing because I didn’t have so many mental compulsions happening.

The effect on my OCD did take longer than on my anxiety, and I think increasing my super low dose definitely helped (10mg to 20mg). I still do struggle with my OCD but it’s a lot better.

It is kind of similar if you talk to a cop.  They deal with the bad stuff in society all the time.

U is Understand that this is just your body's  natural response to fear, T is trust your body's decision to panic because you'll probably feel better afterwards anyway, and A Accept the uncomfortable feelings and panic sensation.
