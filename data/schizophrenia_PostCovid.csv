I'm a 32 year old schizophrenic/schizoaffective patient (I don't really get mood disorders being medicated, but still the occasional delusions. I've been ill since I was like 20.

So, here's the run down of what happened to my enjoyment.

Untreated, it was impossible for me to focus on games or any sort of mentally engaging things. I was stuck, wrapped around the ideas in my head.

I think if you have embarrassing delusions or have a bad experience with something you enjoyed, such as 'this game is about me', can cause you embarrassment when the delusions are gone. It's impossible to predict what twisting of reality your friend will experience.

Now, that I'm currently without major symptoms, I find that I have trouble enjoying games. When I was 22ish, it was easier. 23, little less easy. 24, little less easy... etc. I don't know if it's the medication I'm taking or whether it's my schizophrenia causing lack of interest or maybe underlying depression. That's tough to say. I don't really play video games anymore, but I'm content with watching people play games.

So, there are traumas induced by experiences with schizophrenia, there are effects caused by the medications, and there are effects caused by the residual symptoms.

Schizophrenia is sooooo complicated, that your friend may have a completely different experience. I can't promise he will be completely the same. I'd say, be a good friend. Don't let yourself turn into a persecution delusion for him. You can control what he thinks of you, by being generous and giving space and listening. When he's back up 100%, your friendship will be stronger and he'll probably enjoy playing those games with you.

I hope you and your friend find peace and love in this difficult time for both of you. I'd love to have somebody treat me with the care and compassion that you have shown in this post.

It still pathologizes mental health by stating that our disability is something that is afflicted on us who would otherwise be an able bodied person. It puts the focus on being able bodied over identifying with your disability. 

My point is let people choose how to identify and not to make the distinction for them. Sure you may be a 4th year psych student, but some of us have 14+ years of experience actually living with the disorder. 

When I identify with my disability, I am not saying that it is some monster, I am just saying that my disability has affected my life in such a way that my life is really different from someone without a disability. 

A good blog that I generally agree with [is this one/](https://thebodyisnotanapology.com/magazine/i-am-disabled-on-identity-first-versus-people-first-language/)

Too often those of us with severe mental illness are viewed as something to be cured and thus return to no longer being disabled. This mindset I find is unhelpful because the goal should not be to remove the illness from someone but to find a way to live their life in a way that they are content with in life. The point should be to give those with the disability the best quality life they can have and sometimes that isn't a cure. 

Something around 30% of cases of schizophrenia are considered treatment-resistant. Even those outside of the 30% can experience very unpleasant side effects from medication treatment. The goal to completely eliminate symptoms very often fails or puts someone in a position that is also unfavorable and living a life that is miserable.

Now, i'm not advocating for no medication, but I do think that we need to see the illness as part of the person and focus on living the best life we can rather than aggressively trying to cure it. 

Seperating the person from the disability entirely denies our life experience of how our disability affects our life. Chronic illnesses need to be treated differently from temporary illnesses like the flu or something like adjustment disorder.

The main reason is that symptom re-occurrence after treatment start is very common. In fact the majority do see relapse after first psychosis. Treating the whole person and learning to live a life with your disorder rather than seperating from the disorder can help people cope with such. In such, it no longer becomes about aggressively increasing meds during a relapse or changing them, but rather teaching people how to cope with their episodes so as not to feel as distressed while minimizing the amount of episodes they have to cope with. Some people like me are treatment resistant and live with chronic psychosis.

Learning coping skills and ways to positively manage my psychosis has done a whole lot better for me than any medication has. When I was treated with the intent to completely get rid of my psychosis I was constantly suicidal, but now the place where I live at treats my psychosis as part of my experience and encourages coping skills over all else and I am much happier.

So i'm a little offended that someone saying identity first language is viewing it as a monster. It is often viewing the person as a who they are as a whole, rather than trying to seperate out some part of them as not being a part of them.

Overall it is up to the person on how they identify. Using things like ""objectively"" better is wrong. Same with your dismissive comment on the opinion of someone who actually lives with the disability.

I understand that some people are not comfortable with identity first language, but the answer shouldn't be to automatically assume that they don't identify with it. It should be to ask someone how they refer to themselves.",,1593556766,{},fwix8fl,False,t3_hilesx,False,True,t1_fwiao2c,/r/schizophrenia/comments/hilesx/i_dont_apply_to_this_but_im_looking_and_like_i/fwix8fl/,1593562302,1,True,False,schizophrenia,t5_2r828,,0,[],,,

Because it's extremely hard for some people to share their difficult times, I would like to congratulate you because you're brave and you need to know it. The fact that you're here is so important.

Here we can't say if you're schizophrenic or not, but we can help you if you have some questions. My boyfriend is schizophrenic and I try to read books about this illness to have a better understanding of it, and I think I can help you if you need someone to talk and get advices. Even if you're not schizophrenic in fact, you may have symptoms that are similar to this illness, so any advice you get can help you.

Otherwise, your life is a mess these days and you need help for sure. The first thing I need to say is, you're not the problem or a burden, but you might be a ”special needs” person so for people it's difficult, okay? And not all people are nice, unfortunately. The most important thing to do now in your life is to know what's currently hurting you and what you can do about it so that you can improve your environment and feel better.

But please, **don't be alone**. It's the worst thing you can do for yourself! You must need some alone time, but don't be alone all the time. There is always the possibility of seeing a new psychiatrist, because it's rare to know everything with only one or two or three psychiatrists...

Apparently a lot of my quirky mannerisms kids just love. I'll be goofy and make funny faces or other stuff to make them laugh. I'm a man so I tend to take a wide berth of kids I don't know (don't want to end up on the Stranger Danger segment of the news), but when my friends/family bring their kids around, everybody always wants to talk to me or get me to do things with them. Which is cool at first, but... damn, I want to do stuff with the adults too.

Another thing I've noticed is that we schizos will be better listeners on average when it comes to kids. We can talk to them about their ""imaginary friends"" while kind of keeping it on the DL that those 'friends' are not so nice once you move on to adulthood. A lot of what I assume NT people perceive as nonsense coming from children makes sense to us. We can play pretend with them and really get into it.

The fundamental underlying nature of conventional SZ is that we have a psychotic break that erodes the line that almost everyone's mind draws naturally as a young child (~5 y/o) that helps them distinguish fantasy from reality. Even as adults, we are still capable of understanding reality as children do.

Whether or not this is a question of parenting is a different matter. If you are fairly deadset on your decision to not conceive, then I wouldn't dwell on this too much- parenting is not exactly sunshine and roses revolving around whether or not your child likes you, *but* if you have the insight to maintain a functional degree of sanity, it is more likely that you would be able to communicate effectively with your hypothetical children. I've got a little girl myself, and while I am *obviously* not unbiased in reporting, I hear from everyone who talks about my parenting say I'm a good dad.

The problem with schizophrenia is that especially when paranoia is intense, people can get paranoid about absolutely anything and everything. Just a simple text message saying ""hi hope you're okay would love to see you"", and I'm not talking about your boyfriend here, just in general, could easily trigger thoughts like ""this person wants to see me so they can kill me!!!"" and they're really terrible terrible thoughts to have. Again I'm not talking about your boyfriend, but this is the kind of thing that can go on in the mind of someone with schizophrenia, especially when it involves delusions of paranoia and persecution.

I don't know how close you two are and it's not really my place to ask, but I think letting his family know you're there for them as well as him, is such a better and more genuine way of standing by his side, because these things are rough on the family too, it's so hard to see someone you love struggle and I'm sure you understand that. It could very well be they don't want your support and are just thankful for the kind wishes, but on the other hand they might be really greatful and may even bring you and your boyfriend closer together.

I have to say, none of this is advice, I can't tell you what to do, but if I was in that situation the only people I would allow to make decisions about what is best for me would be the doctors and my family, and even then people with schizophrenia can reject that aswell. So it's a very delicate situation, there's a lot of mind fuck going on.

In all the studies done on sarcosine, researchers generally use 2g/d without any problems and with improvement. It was a rare side effect for that single individual.

Similarly, there are numerous studies done with piracetam @ 3 doses of 1600 mg throughout the day (morning, midday, night).

A lack of sleep influences someone. So does upbringing, education, an insecurity, a negative interaction, a virus, etc. It's even more complex than that. Society puts so much attention on singling out a reason why someone behaves a certain way. The reality is that it's never one reason alone.

All these medicines still may make you gain weight, but they’re a lot better for it than risperidone or olanzapine.",,1596500824,{},g09x3nl,False,t3_i34wky,False,True,t3_i34wky,/r/schizophrenia/comments/i34wky/did_anyone_experience_massive_weight_gain_from/g09x3nl/,1596510382,1,True,False,schizophrenia,t5_2r828,,0,[],,,

I am conducting an online experiment on \*Motor Performance in First-Degree Relatives of People with Schizophrenia\* as part of my Psychology Honours project, at the University of New England.

The aim of the study is to determine whether relatives of people with schizophrenia have different motor performance compared to non-relatives.

The experiment involves completing a short questionnaire, an online interview (if you have a relative with schizophrenia) and a simple finger tapping task which is being hosted by an online platform (Inquisit).

The experiment will take between 20 minutes and 1 hour (depending on whether you have a first-degree relative with schizophrenia or not – if you do, we will conduct an online interview with you).

If you are 18 years of age or older, understand written English, and have access to a computer or laptop please take the time to participate in my study!

This project has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of New England (Approval No: HE20-065)

If your risk of being a victim goes from 4% to 8% it has also doubled and it can be said that you are at greater risk of being the victim than the perpetrator but that doesn't nullify the statistic that you are still multiplying your risk of violence due to mental illness. 

I can agree with some of the OP's points on people who don't have mental illness committing crimes for different reasons and possibly being subject to more greed and vice than a mentally ill person who acts out of distress or desperation. My thing is that mentally ill people are still further removed from reality, are generally less productive, and suffer short and long term from an illness that doesn't just make them special or unique (though I'd argue for neurodivergence in the case of autism, it's not that simple in schizophrenia). For me this has been a crippling illness. However, there really are sociological aspects to this illness that make it both more prevalent in certain marginalized groups and harder to address and treat.

 A very close relative of mine, suffering from Paranoid Schizophrenia, it took alot of different medications ( in patient care for months) until one of them had a positive effect.

Aripiprazole was a game changer for her. She said that it was like a black cloud lifting off her mind.
However, as I said in another comment, what works for one person has no effect on another person with exactly the same illness.

Psychiatric medicine is a bit of a tombola in a way. But don't lose hope. Talk to your Doctor about medication. Sometimes tablets take awhile to kick in &amp; side effects make it difficult to chop &amp; change quickly. 
That means fingers crossed that one medication will be the one that will work for you.

If you feel that it isn't having any effect, it's important that you speak to your CPN or doctor so that they know &amp; can adjust dosage or change your medication.

Wendan Decoction

A fairly affordable traditional Chinese medicine treatment for schizophrenia. Been used for over 800 years. Studies approve of it for SZ too (see link.)

https://forum.schizophrenia.com/t/wendan-decoction-affordable-traditional-chinese-medicine-with-antipsychotic-properties-edited/212359

Amyloban 3399

It's a good antipsychotic supplement with studies backing it.

https://forum.schizophrenia.com/t/amyloban-3399-lions-mane-discussion/152533

About $80 a month. I don't take it anymore but I did when I was worse off.

Vitamin D3 megadosing seems helpful too, it reduces gluten sensitivity bigtime and fixes a leaky gut lining. Might also fix a leaky blood-brain barrier. I am exploring this at the moment.

Medication doesn’t work for me and makes my quality of life unbearable, so I haven’t taken it for a couple of years now and try to muddle through as best as I can. 

The sensations I get include my skin fizzing, bugs crawling on my skin or wiggling about underneath it, feeling stabbed by tiny pins, this weird whooshing air-cannon-type sensation in my legs, and my body being on fire. I’ve gotten used to it for the most part as it’s been going on a long time, and I use distractions and remind myself that it will pass, and I’ve survived the awfulness many times before.

Some people say that using other sensations to block out the tactile hallucinations helps, like you mentioned with ice cubes, but I find that too much stimulation makes it harder to cope with. So when the sensations are bad, I try to have clothes that are comfy, not too tight and not too baggy to flap about my skin when I move, and stay fairly still to avoid making it worse. I make sure my skin doesn’t get too dry as that can make the fizzing worse. Basically, I try to reduce all outside skin stimulation so it’s just the tactile sensations to deal with, and then I distract the hell out of myself until it eases off.

The exception to that is the fire: there’s not enough distraction in the world for your body being on fire! I find cold helps numb me, so either cover the area that feels on fire with ice packs (not ice cubes as the melting sensation of water trickling makes the fizzing worse), or sit in a cold water bath, and then add the distractions. One time, the first time of fire, I damn near lost my mind; couldn’t sleep, was having a total meltdown, but then had the thought to sit in a cold bath. Within about 5 mins, I was calm. It was amazing. I sat there for hours, watching Netflix on my phone.

I started having dreams that would happen later starting when I was around 6th grade. When I was young i used to pray everyday the Lord's prayer and that God would grant me the ability to see the future like the prophets. I eventually gave up after years of praying for that. The first dream I had was about 9/11 at the same time that it happened. I didn't start hallucinating until I was in my senior year of high school, but I believed in crazy stuff sometime around 8th and 9th grade. I had my first dream of the future before losing faith and trying to stare at candles and do telepathy. I don't believe that the dreams of the future come to me by my own power. I think it is probably coming from something else spiritual. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I'm being honest I bought a book on prayers for exorcists to do on people suffering from demonic possession and read it to myself in a whisper while playing gregorian chants in the background just to see if something would happen. Even being on meds I had a vision. I was staring into someone's or something's eyes and in it was of a circle with little flames being spaced out between each other on the circle from a distance. Then a couple of days later I saw the same circle while watching sid roth's it's supernatural and it was an image played for a second during an episode where a guy was talking about going to hell, and then later to heaven. I normally only see snippets of the future in my dreams, not while awake. While I was trying to do the exorcism on myself, it actually felt kind of pleasant. I was disappointed then as I have been when I take communion and the schizophrenia doesn't go away or manifest. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure that schizophrenia is really spiritual in any way, but I have dreams aside from that that show me the future sometimes and I believe that that most certainly is.

Anatoly Yevgenyevich Karpov (Russian: Анато́лий Евге́ньевич Ка́рпов; born May 23, 1951) is a Russian chess grandmaster and former World Champion. He was the official world champion from 1975 to 1985 when he was defeated by Garry Kasparov. Karpov played five matches against Kasparov for the title from 1984 to 1990 without ever defeating him in a match, later becoming FIDE World Champion once again after Kasparov broke away from FIDE in 1993. He held the title until 1999, when he resigned his title in protest against FIDE's new world championship rules.

While as far as is known Fischer was never formally diagnosed,[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer#cite_note-LifeGame-16) there has been widespread comment and speculation concerning his psychological condition based on his extreme views and unusual behavior.[\[498\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer#cite_note-Ponterotto-505) [Reuben Fine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuben_Fine), psychologist and chess player, who met Fischer many times, said that ""Some of Bobby's behavior is so strange, unpredictable, odd and bizarre that even his most ardent apologists have had a hard time explaining what makes him tick"" and described him as ""a troubled human being"" with ""obvious personal problems"".[\[499\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer#cite_note-506)

Valery Krylov, advisor to [Anatoly Karpov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Karpov) and a specialist in the ""psycho-physiological rehabilitation of sportsmen"", believed Fischer suffered from [schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia).[\[498\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer#cite_note-Ponterotto-505) Psychologist [Joseph G. Ponterotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_G._Ponterotto), from secondhand sources, concludes that ""Bobby did not meet all the necessary criteria to reach diagnoses of schizophrenia or [Asperger syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome). The evidence is stronger for [paranoid personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_personality_disorder).""[\[498\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer#cite_note-Ponterotto-505) Magnús Skúlason, a chess player, psychiatrist and head doctor of Sogn Mental Asylum for the Criminally Insane, befriended Fischer towards the end of Fischer's life.

He was at Bobby's bedside as a friend, to try to do anything he could for him. Because of his training, however, he couldn't fail to take note of Bobby's mental condition.

Encouraging a mentally ill person to play the blame game or that it is their responsibility to campaign for change is a terrible idea. The only responsibility a mentally ill individual has is to manage their symptoms day to day and try to get better.

If a mother tells their child the FPS game they're playing leads to violence then there are, survey says, a handful of statistically likely thought hierarchies accumulating over a lifetime when a positive ideation would have been so much better.

1. I was in the prodromal phase for about 5 years we think. I had negative symptoms on and off for that period of time but the big red flag I see now (in hindsight) that was prodromal is the anxiety. It’s hard to be sure because:

2. I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder the first time I sought help for what was my first psychotic episode. Granted I was young (20) and was completely not honest towards the psychiatrist I saw at the time. I also had a diagnosis of depression and anxiety. The anxiety turned out to be the big prodromal thing - who knew anxiety could be a precursor to a schizophrenic/affective etc disorder.

3. I did have some insight into my symptoms. It was why I initially sought help. I knew I was manic and sought help for that predominantly. The psychosis I wasn’t aware of much, but gained insight over time. 

4. The build up was pretty gradual. As I said, negative symptoms starting around 20/21 and the psychotic episode that got me my diagnosis didn’t occur until I was 26. So it was a pretty long time for me. But when I became manic, the psychosis came on pretty rapidly, if that makes sense. 

5. The psychosis is a weird one for me. It came on gradually, and my delusions became more entrenched over a couple of months. Though this is where the whole thing becomes a bit murky because I have had hallucinations/delusions that lasted the whole of the prodromal period too. Things I thought were my reality but I’m still coming to terms with them not being real. One such example is a worm in my head which I can feel moving around. Been going on for years and it was only when I was acutely unwell that I realised it might not be real.

Hospitalization, especially without consent, is the absolute last tool that a psychiatrist will use, primarily because it is extremely invasive, and because it can be traumatic. The only situation where it will even be considered is if you're actively a threat to yourself or others, and even then it's still only a last solution that is used after everything else has been tried. As you say yourself, you're not a threat to anyone, so there's no need to hospitalize you.

Due to how schizophrenia and schizophrenic people are portrayed in popular culture, it might seem like the diagnosis means you will be locked up and treated like a horrible person, but it's simply not true. The psychiatrists, and everyone who work with them, are there to help you, not to punish you, and most of them are kind compassionate people who just want to make sure you're safe.

If you feel like you might be experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia, or any other disorder/mental illness, please don't be scared to talk to your psychiatrist about it. They won't judge you, they'll simply do what they can to put you on a path towards getting better.",,1593539691,{},fwhxfg3,False,t3_hikei4,False,True,t3_hikei4,/r/schizophrenia/comments/hikei4/is_it_possible_to_get_a_diagnosis_without/fwhxfg3/,1593541795,2,True,False,schizophrenia,t5_2r828,,0,[],,,

For many of us schizophrenia really affects our whole life and we would be a completely different person without it.

I am a schizophrenic, it is not objectively better to say a person with schizophrenia. 

Even if you were to remove my schizophrenia from me, the effects it has had on my life would not disappear. The experiences that have shaped me would still be there. If I never had schizophrenia I'd be a completely different person than I am today.

In general you shouldn't correct someone who has schizophrenia from calling themselves a schizophrenic because self-identity matters.

To me, person first language denies how essential the status of disability plays in our life. It shapes our relationships, our life path and how we see ourselves.

Unfortunately a lot of mental health training is done by people who are able bodied and are forcing language upon disabled people about how they should identify which I think is quite ableist.

I understand that schizophrenic is used as a slur by many, but that is to me more of a reason to reclaim it. There shouldn't be shame in having schizophrenia and saying a person is seperate from the disorder is really well...troublesome to me. It reinforces the default being someone without a disorder more than it helps humanize people.

You can even write your own words to use during the meditation, if you or when you feel like it. A quick google search will give you the instructions. It's pretty simple and only takes ten to fifteen minutes. My favorite is Dr. Emma Seppälä's Loving-kindness meditation on YouTube.

If you like an even more focused approach, write a Loving-kindness mantra. Mantras are supposed to protect your mind from stuff like that anyway, right? For instance, I like the mantra, ""May you all always be absolutely happy."" Or, you could write, ""May all of you other beings in the universe always be absolutely happy."" If you like longer mantras, you could write, ""May you all always be absolutely well, happy, and without suffering."" You don't have to use the words, ""always, absolutely,"" as it's not typical to include them. That's just something that I enjoy doing with my mantras.

Choose a way to practice the mantra. From my anecdotal experience, there are six ways to meditate on a mantra. Eyes closed and in the mind, which is probably the most common, eyes closed and out loud, eyes open and in the mind, which is probably the most difficult to do for a sustained period, eyes open and out loud, during Zazen and in the mind, which I've found the most effective, and during Zazen and out loud. Zazen is Zen meditation that involves staring at a spot on the ground in front of you and remaining motionless for a set period.

I recall you saying she was on Invega and that it was making her slow? That's not the only injectable though. If she's hearing voices in the tub maybe she needs a higher strength shot. The slowness is manageable, as long as she doesn't have negatives and can maintain herself.

Maybe convince her to try a higher strength shot, then consider a different med if that still doesn't work. Like Clozapine is great for this.

Fully treating SZ is a grind, it takes time and requires a lot of compliance with the treatment. Getting her stable is the first step, otherwise she won't follow through.

The act of dissociating ones self out of the shared human delusion is a protective one for people and allows the mind a safe retreat or distance. ISPS for psychosis has a lot of webinars if you are looking to learn more. Jung has done a lot of good work as well around working with people with psychosis. Hearing Voices network is mutual aid support that helps people understand the content of their experiences. 

We need to shift away from prevention and toward healing.  The prevention and disease models paint psychosis as an abnormal almost
Subhuman state, not an experience where a person is trying to make sense of the world. What this does is take a eugenics view of human experiences and deem them as acceptable or
Those that need to be erradicated. So instead of being helped through psychosis, the treatment is to subdue and deem it disease. 

So it’s not wrong that someone experiences psychosis - it’s very normal. What we do about it is a huge problem - because without context people just think the answer is meds and cbt/DBT or symptom management without actually getting to the root of issues. So then nobody really heals because the methods don’t actually provide any healing. 

On the other side, psychosis is also not always about the types trauma we think are trauma like physical or sexual abuse. It can also be societal demands, restrictive culture, oppressive gender roles, rigid education system, etc. 

What reduction to the disease model does is just try to adjust people to or tell them they should be better adjusted to these systems that are harmful - instead of showing them that it makes perfect sense that they are feeling or experiencing the things they do. And what that does is create a culture where the ability for the people most affected and hurt by the systems are stripped of power to change them - because they are instead just labeled crazy.",,1589143512,{},fq79hwh,False,t3_ggkl2b,False,True,t1_fq74fm6,/r/schizophrenia/comments/ggkl2b/not_taking_my_medicine_on_purpose/fq79hwh/,1589146118,2,True,False,schizophrenia,t5_2r828,,0,[],,,

The book is academic. The author explores the question, ""Why does schizophrenia exists?"" What we know now is that schizophrenia is genetic, but it's not one gene; it's a combination of many. From anthropology, we've observed that schizophrenic symptoms have existed since tribal eras. People with what we now consider to have schizophrenia have been 1% of a given population. Since we see how debilitating it is, why has it continued to exist? The author argues that there had been evolutionary advantages to it. For one, shamans were most likely schizophrenics. They were spiritual leaders communities deemed necessary and regarded with high esteem. Self-proclaimed prophets and other religious leaders were most likely schizophrenics. Yes, Jesus, Mohammed, Joseph Smith, etc... That makes a lot of sense to me cuz I and many others have had that Jesus delusion.

The breathing is just the thing to REDIRECT YOUR ATTENTION, away from the thoughts and back to the physical reality of the present moment.

Do you ever try other techniques like sub-vocalizing?  Obviously it is not perfect, but when you use the parts of your brain necessary to speak out loud you are actually using the parts your brain needs to generate voices.  Dealing with mental illness is very much a game of taking away the illnesses resources sometimes.

However, I fell into a nap and while the plane was taking off I woke up to the worst panic attack and at that time I haven’t experienced any panic attacks for my whole life. Everything was surreal, I didn’t know if I was actually on the plane or am I hallucinating? Did the plane crash and I was sent to a different  me in a different universe? 

To this day I do not know how or why these thoughts started to race through my mind but what I know after literally been haunted by it for months that it was consuming me and I would follow up with thoughts and think of other reality-doubt stuff 

I got depressed, the flight and first time experience was months ago and I still feel like I’m on that plane. I also doubted that I’m developing schizophrenia. 

Then I figured out that I’m stuck on this loop of doubting my reality and feeling weird all the time and said fuck all this stuff I’m gonna get rid of this loop 

First thing I did was I get a deep breath everytime this thoughts raced so I could relax 

Second thing was everytime and I mean it EVERY SINGLE TIME i get one of these thoughts or started to feel weird I would shut it off and INSTANTLY think of something beautiful or remembering a fun day, just think of anything that makes you happy. At first couple of days it wasn’t really working but I kept doing it. 

2-3 weeks later I noticed that I’m feeling better, I’m not thinking about it all the time. I started to think of it when I’m bored or before I sleep and I got so fucking happy that i saw improvements.

By 2 months since I’ve done the two steps I said I felt A LOT better and these thoughts would come once in a week and I would shut it right off to think of something else followed by a couple of weeks It disappeared.

Honestly this is literally one of the worst thing ever happened to me and it was so mentally exhausting.

As for explaining it to other people, I’ve had most success with trying to explain it as very extreme pattern recognition.

While this could be a sign of schizophrenia, racing thoughts have been found in plenty other mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, OCD, etc. Even people with no diagnosed mental health disorder can experience them. So don't jump to conclusions and torture your mind with ideas. 

You can also look this up as ""mind pops"". 

I find that the best thing that has worked to control my racing thoughts was to keep stress as far away as possible. Also found that not taking them seriously and laughing at their randmoness works, as well as getting enough sleep (very important this one).

Another problem is, that the one's trying to help you have no clue into what you are going through, and they have no idea how to treat it. They only think of treating the positive symptoms too.

Another thing is, I think schizophrenia affects cultural society in a way as well. It's like some cultures are built on delusions, and has thrived for as long as it has come into existence. So having schizophrenia is like a culture clash depending on where you live.

Idk, I don't just don't pay attention to it anymore, people are going to believe what they want, and it's not like I can convince them otherwise to what my schizophrenia is. It's like the older you get, most people become disconnected from too, and they have no idea to tell the difference anymore.

From my few months living here I've noticed there seems to three main sorts of people who stay at hostels. The first kind are foreign tourists here on a working visa who are into backpacking culture and move from hostel to hostel. The second kind are locals (Aussies) who travel for work and want a temporary place to stay close to their work so basically a domestic version of the first kind albeit less touristy. And the third kind are people like myself who have had a bit of a rough past and needed somewhere cheap to stay that doesn't have as much of a commitment as say signing a lease. It's cheap but homely.

You get the occasional asshole or troublemaker and I wouldn't claim to say I'm friends with everyone here but it's a very commonal place to live and you almost feel like one big family that is always changing. You meet many different people from many different cultures and most people are friendly and nonjudgmental so you can form bonds quite quickly if you put yourself out there.

Something to keep in mind in general going forward: Schizophrenia is not a dealbreaker in and of itself. Neither is any other mental illness or physical health condition. What COULD be a dealbreaker is if the person isn’t willing to admit that they have the issue or refuses to seek/stick with treatment, get help, take proper care of themselves, etc. Again, this is true for ANY condition, not just schizophrenia, because the result will be an unhealthy and exhausting relationship for both people.

I’ve become a little more functional but I still feel ‘slow’ cognitively. Just not sharp like I used to be. I was taking Latuda, then Vraylar. I’ve since tried Sertraline, Venlafaxine and I’m on a high dose of lithium. Somewhere along the line my libido went too. 
I’m so nervous about trying Prozac and especially another antipsychotic. Heard so many bad tales of Prozac killing sex drive even more and more numbness.

Abstract

Despite the toxicity of tobacco smoking, preclinical and epidemiological studies suggest that nicotine may protect neurons against neurodegeneration. This action is attributed to the activation of neuronal nicotinic receptors that, via influx of Ca2 +, trigger intracellular pathways to block cell death mechanisms including apoptosis. Furthermore, due to its high membrane permeability, nicotine penetrates into the cytoplasm to bind nicotinic receptors expressed on mitochondrial membranes to activate, through an ion-flux-independent process, enzymatic cascades preventing cell death. Because of the deficit of central cholinergic systems underlying Alzheimer's disease, the use of nicotine or a related agonist to promote the activity of cholinergic signaling might be a tool to treat this disease. On brain stem motor networks overexcited by glutamate uptake block, nicotine protects motoneurons from excitotoxic death by uncoupling their electric gap junctions and curtailing their collective excitation. Overall, these results suggest that nicotine or related drugs might represent a strategy to counteract neurodegeneration.

The Wunderink study had a sample size 28% larger compared to the average psych study. Harrow had a sample size double the average sample size.

The studies used to claim these drugs “work” are studies that abruptly put the non-drug group through withdrawal.  58%-85% of psych studies abruptly withdrawal the non-drug group (For antipsychotics it is 58%). 90% of antipsychotic studies used a very fast withdrawal design.

If everyone does understand withdrawal why are people with financial and moral conflicts of interest claiming studies finding the drugs cause withdrawal mean the drugs are good?
Did they never actually read the research and therefore have no clue what it says or are they being dishonest? 

The evidence says the drugs worsen all outcomes and your response is, “I doubt people with financial and moral conflicts of interest can be wrong and/or dishonest.” 

You shouldn’t reject what the evidence and data says because of a bandwagon logical fallacy.  If society took that approach we’d still be doing blood letting, lobotomies and using mercury as a cure all.

Quite a few of the studies that I've seen here also have quite a small sample group.

Drugs like Seroquel have no long term benefits. They increase psychotic symptoms by 250%, decrease cognitive functioning by 40% and worsen all outcomes.

There are zero tests for mental illness because there are no known biological differences among people with these labels. 

The reason people claim these drugs are good is because there are studies that take people addicted to them, withdrawal half and claim that since the drugs cause withdrawal they must be good.

Quitting them will likely cause withdrawal (though some people don’t experience very bad withdrawal). The major strategy to reduce withdrawal is to slowly reduce the drug dosage over many months.

1. Honestly the best thing you can do, considering he's not getting treatment, is let him know that you love him and will be there for him even while he's paranoid or delusional. Let him talk about the delusions without freaking out or getting mad, because sometimes talking about them can calm us down, and if he's confused and wants to wander keep an eye on him. Help him get treatment without his father knowing if you can, since meds are very very important to manage symptoms.
2. Do NOT let him buy guns. Guns and delusions are a bad mix. I'm not saying he is violent, but there are times you get so confused that you can accidentally use a weapon without intending to or start firing at hallucinations and accidentally hurt someone. It's best if someone is in charge of his money until he is on medication
3. The best gift is something that might calm him. Maybe a nice scented showergel or a jigsaw puzzle to help calm his mind? Stuffed animals sometimes work, but I've also had times where I was convinced an angel is possessing mine and telling me things.

I really urge you to talk about your concerns around medication with your psychiatrist, a psychiatric nurse, etc. to see if there's a comfortable solution you guys could figure out. 

That said, there are other things you can do that will help you stay healthy, in addition to medication. They don't and can't replace medication, but they're still good things to do. Physical health and mental health are super correlated. Eating as well as you can (whole grains, chicken and fish, lots of vegetables including dark leafy greens daily, berries, few desserts or fried foods) makes a huge difference in how you feel. Since schizophrenia may involve a neurodegenerative process, look into the MIND diet. 

Get daily exercise--it's good for the heart and brain. Try going to the gym daily, and alternating weights and cardio. Try to go on long walks outside daily. Consider taking vitamins. Most people should take a B complex, Omega 3, and vitamin D. My psychiatrist also says there's some slight evidence that coenzyme Q10 might help a bit with symptoms of psychosis. Get a good eight hours of sleep every night.

Get frequent social interaction. Join some classes at the community centre. If there's a schizophrenia support group in your area, go to it. If there's a peer support centre or resource space for people living with mental illnesses in your community, go there. Hang out with your friends. Talk to your parents. Work if you're able to. Don't become isolated.

Absolutely, 100% get therapy, *especially* if you stay unmedicated. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy works wonders. There's good evidence that CBT can help reduce symptoms of psychosis, especially paranoia. 

Find healthy ways to express and cope with your feelings. Art is a really common outlet among schizophrenic people, as is poetry, music, journalling...whatever works for you and helps you feel better and calmer.",,1605288198,{},gc6496i,False,t3_jti51k,False,True,t3_jti51k,/r/schizophrenia/comments/jti51k/hi_fellow_people_with_schizophrenia/gc6496i/,1605292507,2,True,False,schizophrenia,t5_2r828,,0,[],,,

Hydrate. 

Be it hot drinks, cold drinks. 
Showers or baths, I like baths in dark rooms. 


Eat many different food groups every day.
Fresh cooked greens, 
Proteins, 
Cooked fresh or dried fruits. 
If you're picky, it's treating yourself worse; extend your diet to what's available to you. 


Sleep: for goodness sake don't skip it. 
It makes everything worse when you don't sleep. 


Light PT, whatever brings you joy. 
Even a few stretches and a little dance is better then nothing. 


Holding yourself accountable to one chore a day. 
Did dishes but couldn't do much else? 
Still valid and counts. 

I look at cute photos right before bed. 
Kittens and puppies snuggling. 
Neat new character concepts from around the world. 
Beautiful places and art. 
Even scary art and memes are good brain food right before sleep, when you're wrestling with life.


All this being said...
If you're seeing stuff constant. 
And panicked, scared? 
Meds are the best thing to give to yourself, with a sympathetic doctors care. 

Please change hospitals, if you don't like your care team. 

Try calling a health line, if you're unsure where some are in your area. 


(While I'm unmedicated, I don't recommend it. 
It's only due to life-threatening corn allergies. Corn melts where it touches, if it's in meds it's 3 days of melting through my digestive tract and organs. 
98% or more of medication has corn in it. It's horrifying, and risks my life on a single dose.)

So I take my self care like a pirate getting paid for it. 

I spend 1-2 hours every day putting as many food groups as I humanely can into breakfast.
A braised hash with nuts, seeds, fresh and dried fruit, fresh and dried vegetables. At least 7 kinds, every day. 

Fresh fruit, cut up. Sometimes cooked, too. I've got hundreds of scars in all of my organs like spiderweb, cooked food is easier to digest. 

Sometimes meat, sometimes eggs, sometimes oatmeal or porridge. 

A fresh pastry or homemade cookie, a frozen waffle, rice? The variety in every bite really, really counts. 

I add a pinch of almond flour, coconut flour, sometimes pistachio flour to my coffee. 
I've tried oat flour too. 
A spoon of cocoa powder in my coffee  grounds too. 

Makes it more like porridge, the body feels the nutrition.

One of the reason for the tracker is he has denied permission for any information about his treatments, or anything really to be discussed with the family. Makes it very difficult help with medications when we don't know what he takes or the correct doses! 

We are usually limited to his location (if on ward or at residence etc) and if he is physically safe. 

Good thing mentioning including him though as that wasn't the plan (don't think he would react positively). It might be worth building one for him to have access too and log himself like you said. He doesn't like talking to us at the best of times but maybe that's a good work around. Let him choose to log how he is feeling and we can react accordingly (give him space etc). I think I'll wait until he is in a better state before thinking about bringing him into the main one. 

From the outside perspective I'd say he definitely prefers to be alone and quiet. Blankets and hot tea also but usually gets quite irritated if you try to talk or distract him.

Here are a list of long term studies and their findings.

Harrow: Drugs decrease cognitive functioning by 50%, increase anxiety by 300%, increase psychotic symptoms by 250% and cut employment by 2/3.

Wunderink: At the 7 year mark those who were once addicted to the drugs and withdrew had 3 times higher full recovery rates

Rappaport: Using the drugs increased symptoms by over two times and increased hospitalizations by 9 times.

Retrospective studies from hospitals: Drug use is tied to twice the relapse rate over 5 years.

Cross culture WHO studies: Countries that barely used any drugs had almost two times better outcomes. 

There is not a single long term study that finds these drugs have any benefit unless you confuse withdrawal and/or impairment with a drug benefit.

Another study found that at doses used for psychotic depression almost a year of use resulted in brain damage equivalent to 4 times the brain decline that occurs over a non drugged persons entire lifespan. 

Agitation and anxiety are effects of these drugs and also effects of withdrawal. Meaning over time the longer you’re off them the less likely you are to be feel agitation and anxiety.

Don and Mimi Galvin seemed to be living the American dream. After World War II, Don's work with the Air Force brought them to Colorado, where their twelve children perfectly spanned the baby boom: the oldest born in 1945, the youngest in 1965. In those years, there was an established script for a family like the Galvins--aspiration, hard work, upward mobility, domestic harmony--and they worked hard to play their parts. But behind the scenes was a different story: psychological breakdown, sudden shocking violence, hidden abuse. By the mid-1970s, six of the ten Galvin boys, one after another, were diagnosed as schizophrenic. How could all this happen to one family?
     What took place inside the house on Hidden Valley Road was so extraordinary that the Galvins became one of the first families to be studied by the National Institute of Mental Health. Their story offers a shadow history of the science of schizophrenia, from the era of institutionalization, lobotomy, and the schizophrenogenic mother to the search for genetic markers for the disease, always amid profound disagreements about the nature of the illness itself. And unbeknownst to the Galvins, samples of their DNA informed decades of genetic research that continues today, offering paths to treatment, prediction, and even eradication of the disease for future generations.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to say something really quick.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You seem very smart and I respect you for one reason. and that reason is because you've decided your major NOT because it has a lot of money or whatever

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

BUT you followed your passion and decided to follow something you LOVE. not many people do that and a lot just study to get a job that they don't even enjoy.. but do it for the paycheck...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

anyways when it comes to music i really listen to a lot of different stuff and my taste changes over time BUT Nirvana has always been a band that i can listen to all the time.. their music had such an influence on me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Slowdive, Joy Division, Radiohead are also bands that have had a HUGEE impact and influence on me and inspired me to start writing music..

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And when it comes to physics, it's my passion, I've been reading books about science in general and physics specifically since I was in 4th grade.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm generally curious and physics just keeps me excited

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

it gives me the feeling of a 5yo seeing a magic trick at a birthday party

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My favorite musical artist is Regina Spektor and my favorite songs of hers are Eet and Human Of The Year. Her music has been very impactful for me. I’ve been listening to her since middle school and I’m 24 now. While other musicians and genres have come and gone in my life she’s the one artist I’ve listened to consistently since I first started to form my own musical taste. I’ve been playing piano since before I started listening to her but she’s my biggest inspiration to keep playing. 

My philosophy on life... wow that’s a big question lol. I’d say my philosophy on life has been largely influenced by eastern philosophies that I have studied in school, especially Buddhism and Daoism. I consider myself a Buddhist, though I haven’t officially converted yet since all the temples are closed for Covid. As far as Daoism goes, I take a lot of inspiration from a Daoist philosophical text called the Zhuangzi. 

I decided to study religions simply just because I found it interesting, but it’s been one of the most important things I’ve done I think. It’s not only impacted my personal philosophies, but I think the most important part of religious studies is the fact that it forces one to recognize that other people think differently then oneself. That’s been a big epiphany for me. And I think that I knew on a sort of intellectual level that other people think differently long before I studied religions, but religious studies forced me to internalize that and really think about how other people think. Hopefully that makes sense.

NEVER, be ashamed of it. It does NOT define you or make you who you are



If people react badly to you being schizophrenic, then they’re a bunch of goonies who don’t even deserve your time



You’re strong, and you’re unique



Your existence is a miracle



Just don’t care what people say, just follow your own way, be simple, be nice, be yourself



People who are worth it and deserve your time won’t judge you for anything, they will love you for who you are



Just surround yourself with PURE souls, not toxic idiots...

Nonstop full color VR overlays on reality. 

(CBD makes my brain swell when it's over 0.10 % )

CBG goes straight to the ocular nerves, makes my eyes ache and sometimes see stuff. 

I like Indica for pain, nausea and inflammation. 

I don't get extra delusions or hear stuff on Indica. 

... but I don't overdo the products in a day, either. 

I have a severe corn allergy. 
It melts where it touches.
Corn is in 98% of all medication.

My back broke for a 5th time on January 1st.
I've got hundreds of scars through all of my organs. 
It gives me a bad quality of life, always on the edge of blacking out from pain. 

I've got less range of movement and stamina then my grandmother. 

But I have a long, wooden Gandalf style pipe after meals. 

Sometimes I'll try tinctures, edibles or drinks when the pain is really bad. 

You gotta try just a little bit at a time an wait an hour for anything edible, the body processes it differently and it can go from nothing to a scary roller coaster with no warning. 

It'll last hours with edibles, about a hour with smoking green, and varies with vapor pens. 

I prefer my long medicinal pipe where the people at the medicine shop tell me I smoke like a grandpa. 

Or a drink or candy to come with me, if I need to travel and I know the pain from the vibration of the vehicle can make me black out in public. 

That gets everyone in trouble, blacking out in public. 

But I'm told my reactions to CBD are extremely uncommon, CBG as well. 

If you haven't tried it, please start in small doses.

Best case, your friend goes to see a doctor, is honest with them and accepts their diagnosis.

But, if you think it's as simple as that, then YOU'RE the delusional one.

One thing I learned is that it's not as easy to talk someone out of a delusion as you might think.  For example, put yourself in this scenario: You mention the pigeons you saw on the way to visit a close friend. The friend looks at you strange and asks what you are talking about. ""Pigeons,"" you say, ""I saw a few on the way over."" The friend laughs nervously and says ""You're messing with me, right?  Pigeons aren't real."" Now you're convinced that HE is messing with YOU. ""Ok, whatever"" you say, it's obviously a stupid joke and you don't even know why this conversation is happening.  ""No, Hold up."" your friend will not let you blow off this conversation about pigeons. ""Are you seriously telling me that you think you saw pigeons on the way over here.  Like for REAL, honest to God."" He's not laughing anymore. He looks scared and dead serious.

You, of course know that pigeons are real.  You've seen them, you've heard them, they may have even shit on your head.  There is nothing your friend can say that will convince you that pigeons do not and have never existed.  Does he not know about pigeons? Is he playing a trick on you?  Is it a weird joke? You will come up with 25 reasons your friend is telling you lies before you even start to consider that maybe the pigeons were never there.

This is how your friend feels when you tell him that none of these things are happening. You become less trustworthy and they may start to think that you are in on it.  You can't lose that trust.  It's a balancing act. Don't confirm that these things are happening, but don't just say that it's impossible or crazy.  The most I would recommend doing is to suggest alternative situations or try to help debunk theories.  For example, if ""The CIA was snooping in my apartment again last night, because my mail was thrown on the floor."" respond with ""This window is open a crack, maybe a gust of wind just blew it off the counter.""  You aren't confirming that the CIA was involved, but you also aren't telling them that everything they know is a lie.

Your friend will need support, and it will take time for him to trust you enough to think ""Hey, maybe I should look into these pigeons.""",,1612362292,{},glv3ef7,False,t3_lbktt2,False,True,t3_lbktt2,/r/schizophrenia/comments/lbktt2/mentally_unstable_friend_need_advice_please/glv3ef7/,1612667442,3,True,False,schizophrenia,t5_2r828,,0,[],,,

He never told me about his family history of schizophrenia. And we used to smoke weed and I would say that you shouldn’t smoke if your family has a history of mental illness, I was very big on drug safety when I used to smoke and stuff, even though weed generally is safe anyway.

Long story short, one day my mate started acting really odd with me. He was ex military and could squash me if he wanted to, and he just randomly said “let’s squash this problem then”. I asked what problem, he started saying “ you know what I’m talking about, you don’t like me anymore and you want to kill me” or something along those lines.

As this went on for hours, I was nearly crying trying to tell him I loved him like a brother and him accusing me of wanting him dead, and shit. And him threatening to beat me up, eventually we split ways. Next day he said we’re cool but he still didn’t trust me. Over the month or two he started to get small anxiety attacks, and he would randomly flip out on me when I was just sitting minding my business.

A bit later, apparently he got kicked out and moved into Southampton to live with his dad. By this point he’d told us that he thinks he is developing schizophrenia, but wouldn’t accept any help. He got kicked out (I found out a little while ago) because he punched his step-dad. 

When he got home, him and his dad (who used to be really close) started to sour, and eventually he got kicked out again from his dads home for beating him up I think, although it might have just have been a small fight. Police were called on him etc.

Nowdays he’s homeless. And he calls my freinds and says that he wants to kill me. Somehow he blames me for a lot of what happened to him. There was an incident where we got jumped and they stole my car, and I managed to get away but he got stabbed and beat up by about 14 people. It was a case of mistakes identity because we was just visiting the area. But he blames this on me, and always says he’s gonna get me back for it.

All this could have been prevented. Writing it out you can so obviously see where every mistake is.

First, he never admitted to having a family history of schizophrenia, because he knew I wouldn’t smoke with him.

Second, when it got obvious he was getting ill, and he even started to admit it, he never saw a doctor.

Third, it got so bad, and he never saw a doctor at all to the point where he got into physical altercations with his family. He was usually extremely respectful.

Fourth, his family kicked him out, without seeking help for his mental health.

Fifth, his dad kicked him out leaving him completely homeless. And his mum didn’t notice at this point that this behaviour must mean he is struggling. 

And finally, even with the knowledge he is mentally ill, and seeing the spiral his life has gone down, he still doesn’t try to better his situation. He’s now living with gangs, and as I said, is obsessive over his old life. Constantly for years threatening me and my family. He knows where I live, because we were so close and I don’t know where he lives because he is homeless. Scary situation. I know he’s been arrested for a stabbing and possession of knifes 2 times now.

I also believed that I had psychic powers and that I was living in a simulation.  This went on for a few days until one day I woke up and something felt, different.  The voices were quieter and I could think more clearly, my thoughts weren’t fuzzy anymore, and I hadn’t realized that they had been fuzzy until they weren’t anymore.  I also felt more relaxed, not so agitated, which also hadn’t noticed till then.  I then “heard(again, not actually heard, you know what I mean)” the thought”the government is putting thoughts in your head” and for the first time in a few days, it sounded silly.  I then felt very embarrassed and like I had been a fool to believe such silly and that I’d wasted days obsessing over something that was all in my head.

it began with a lot of religious thoughts, especially about hell and thinking I was dead or that i was being punished - that was pretty constant for a few months, but then i started becoming agoraphobic, which led to my first persecutory delusions. at the same time, i started having deja vu constantly, and began to view my life as a sort of book that i could figure out (like finding foreshadowing and analyzing it and not tempting fate), which just led to even more paranoia and fear. after i had this “i can analyze my life hard enough to solve it” thought train, it really began to spiral, with connecting dots that didn’t even exist, magical thinking, increasingly persecutory delusions, until it was just in a totally different reality

2. The problems of pol? Do you mean 'politics' by 'pol'? Well, the problems of politics, the organisation of society, change, and have changed. Your view is defeatist and is a false notion of 'human nature' as some stagnant, rigid, unchanging thing - this is not true, demonstrably so. And just because things like hunger and war have existed in the past and exist today doesn't mean the nature of those things haven't changed or are somehow inescapable. Human beings have not been around for very long. For the MAJORITY OF HUMAN EXISTENCE on this planet, we lived in primitive communist societies where conflict was relatively limited, the deprivation of millions of people when it came to things like food was impossible, and your worries about 'giving respect' was, well... an absurd notion. (Not that this was some utopian paradise.) To think that there has been no change whatsoever in the move from primitive communism to agrarian societies and to slavery and to feudal systems of exploitation, to capitalism, is just absurd. Even just talking about slavery, feudalism, and capitalism - they are all exploitative systems, but that doesn't mean there are HUGE marked changes from one to the other. Even looking back only say 1000 years, culturally and socially there have been changes that you probably can't even wrap your head around... And as for 'roman' - presumably you mean 'Rome' being one of the most advanced civilisations of the ancient world and your claim that all we have left of their legacy is 'utter desolation' - I have no idea why you think that and I can't even possibly imagine why anyone could come up with such a notion, it is factually incorrect and silly. I mean, it sounds like you want to be very concrete about it so... I'm pretty sure you take municipal sewage systems for granted right? Or does the Cloaca Maxima just not register with you?  

3. 'The problems of people never change. Never has, never will.' This is an assertion that doesn't seem to be backed up by anything, it is an unsubstantiated opinion that just reflects your own mind more than anything objective in the world. It's demonstrably untrue. Also, I don't see the connection between this statement and the idea that the legacy of Roman civilisation is 'utter desolation'. How are those two thoughts related? How does one follow from the other? 'Hey here's an example of how people's problems never change and never will change and that there's nothing new under the sun - Roman Civilisation fell and all that is left of their legacy is utter desolation!' Surely that contradicts the point you are making? 'Nothing changes, for example: look at this thing that changed!'   

4. 'People hate each other for no reason.' Well, I'd argue that people hate each other and there's always reasons. Why are you so sure there is no reason? Give some example of someone hating someone for no reason and there's almost certainly a reason - it might not be A GOOD REASON, but there's always a reason. Also, people have found themselves in conflict with other people in the past, hated each other, narcissism of small differences can seem intractable, yes, but it is not as if these things aren't filtered through different cultural and societal prisms, it isn't as if the reasons don't change or the nature and effect of people hating each other doesn't change. Also, it isn't necessarily a problem, the result of people hating each other (for REASONS) being nuclear catastrophe is a lot different to the result of people hating each other being whining about the other person at the pub after work.",,1592798880,{},fvlsnp0,False,t3_hddv8w,False,True,t1_fvlqzed,/r/schizophrenia/comments/hddv8w/so_apparently_pyscatrists_are_drugs_accirding_the/fvlsnp0/,1592798881,1,True,False,schizophrenia,t5_2r828,,0,[],,,

First, communication difficulties like you're describing are a hallmark feature of delusions and disorganized thinking... which, while commonly associated with schizophrenia, are by no means unique to it. To lump all of us in with those conspiracy theory nuts (like the oh-so-lovely QAnon) is rather insulting. It is of no more merit to say they are schizophrenic than they are OCD. That delusional rambling is very far from unique to us, even when we are very sick.

Second, conspiracies like that can be drug-induced (esp. meth, other stimulants, occasionally hallucinogens), and as much as I hate to sound like I'm gatekeeping, the difference between a schizophrenic and somebody have a psychotic meltdown is a diagnosis. You are not schizophrenic until you receive your diagnosis, until that point you have psychotic symptoms.

Third, What you are describing (briefly) is consistent with someone having a psychotic break, but schizophrenia is a relatively narrow type of psychosis. The person you're referencing could be bipolar. They could have SZ or SZA. They could have smoked a lot of meth. They could also just hang out in the conspiracy dens on the internet a lot.

Now, in the spirit of Father's Day, time for a sit-down chat. The reason you are rustling so many feathers is that you see one thing and automatically assume schizophrenia. There is *much* more to schizophrenia than delusions and rambling, and there is many other reasons for why someone would do that than just schizophrenia. Just as a matter of perspective for you to think about- I do not mean any disrespect- but I believe if we're keeping track that my grammar is better than yours, and I am quite mad.

What you have done is *stereotype* us- which is a type of discrimination. Whatever is wrong with that person is their particular problem, and we do not automatically find solidarity with everyone who is out of their minds.

Someone can get a positive feeling, a sense of trust and reinforcement, in a relationship that is bad for them. And when dealing with such an imbalanced relationship as a doctor-patient one, there is in most cases an implicit sense of trust that can be easily exploited - the 'white gown' phenomenon is, too, something that has been extensively studied. To take a less controversial example, if someone had cancer and they went to see a homeopathic medicine specialist who said their homeopathic treatment could treat their cancer, and the person with cancer, without knowing any better, agreed and they reported that seeing this person made them feel better, they had full confidence in them, and that they were positive that the homeopathic treatment was good for them and helping them - and on top of that, let's assume the homeopathic medicine specialist was acting in good faith and fully believed that they were acting in the person's best interest and that their treatment was efficacious - well, none of this changes the fact that there is no evidence that water is a treatment for cancer.

I was with you until you said this. 

So you found a textbook ""schizo"" and decided to check the official reddit community to see if we support him or agree with him or something? 

Many of us have delusions we can't influence or control. Most of us don't even recognize we're delusional or psychotic until an episode ends and we discover our brains have fucked us over again. 

Medication options are limited, difficult, expensive, and damaging. Some of us can't afford care or housing or food. Most have been abandoned by family and can't maintain healthy relationships. The condition itself is massively depressing because it ruins your stability on a regular basis, and unstable / insecure living is basically toxic to the entire human nervous system. 

Yes, that means people with psychotic disorders may have difficulty communicating as their symptoms intensify. 

And you present us with this trophy example of paranoia and delusion, expecting us to validate him or shun him or argue about him? 

He's us. He needs help, not mockery or examination by a peanut gallery. You're lucky you're not in his position, scared of your own home, constantly monitored, unable to sleep, doubting everything that once felt safe or made you happy. 

Have some empathy. 

Also, there's a fair number of people w psychotic disorders and severe mental health issues who are successful, happy, loved, and well cared for. We should all be so lucky. Don't think it's easy to pick a schizophrenic out of a crowd, or that we're all homeless tragedy actors.

The best thing you can do is breath deep when this happens and tell yourself it doesn't matter if it's real or not. You might have done some damage. It will probably get better. The real risk is that you have a susceptibility to mental illness and the stress from freaking out about these experiences you have causes it to trigger.

You need to get your stress level down, preferably without drugs. Walks, enya, hot showers, herbal tea. Keep a journal and document the experiences you have, and try not to freak out about them. It's unlikely to develop into schizophrenia unless you already had a predisposition - and then it's probably actually triggered from the prolonged stress.

When I get that way with others that means I’m really in a bad place.

Difficult situations are less frequent as I have gotten older and learned more about myself.

Otherwise, what you've described sounds a lot more like my experience with PTSD than with paranoid psychosis, which generally involved bizarre delusions of persecution. A general feeling of ""everyone is out to get me"" typically does precede the bizarre delusions though. 

Here is a study I found about PTSD with psychotic features, which can happen. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17637580/ I cant find a way to read the whole study, but I'm on mobile and the abstract provides some info. 

I'm definitely not saying you're not schizophrenic, you could be developing it and the trauma could be a trigger especially if you're at the right age and are genetically predisposed to it. But these symptoms can also possibly be explained by PTSD.

It's tough to describe, just anxiety slowly turning into paranoid ideas where I would spend more and more time trying to ""connect the dots"" in whatever was going on around me. Trying to figure out what was behind people's actions, stuff on television, things I was reading, traffic outside, everything. It was all slowly becoming hyper-interconnected in my mind. This developed into more elaborate ""explanations"" and ideas that grew more grandiose and developed into world-wide conspiracy beliefs. 

Eventually became delusional, then outright slid into psychosis. Thought actors on television were looking straight at me and sending me signals. I thought everyone in the world could read my mind. Everything was bugged, my whereabouts were tracked with GPS.During the delusional/psychotic stage, I wasn't eating much and had a huge problem with insomnia, went several days and nights with zero sleep.

I didn't become psychotic suddenly or totally, all at once, like a ""psychotic break."" It was a gradual deterioration. So maybe 10% delusion every day, to then maybe 30% of the day spent thinking about delusions, then 60%, etc.

I know now that's not true though. and in high school I thought I was destined to become the next school shooter which made me really scared and feel guilty to the point I wouldn't eat and kept throwing up. thankfully that started the last couple of weeks of my senior year so it went away after the final day but I still feel bad about it. 

there's been others but I think that gives the general idea what they're usually like. over the past few weeks they've started getting really bad. and I've started hallucinating for the first time, but little things like peripheral and like I feel bugs on me and people standing behind me

So residual now has been \~4 years, but before that it was over a decade of being symptomatic. I had some *real* deep-seated delusions, meds didn't even touch them. Legit believed I was a god (to some degree) for over a decade lol. Then the pure psychosis came a-callin' and it was time for me to do my divine duty... aaaaand residual.

We have been in a relationship since mid-January 2019, and he went through a psychotic episode in late September 2019. So not long, but through all that's happened in the last 6 months we have grown a lot closer through it. 

When we met he told me he was diagnosed with bipolar a few months beforehand but it didn't scare me off. But as we got to know each other I didn't believe it (I have a family member with bipolar and know the condition well). 

He was going through psychosis silently. No one, not even me, knew he was seeing and hearing things that weren't there. He broke up with me for 2 weeks because of the paranoia/suicidal thoughts. He couldn't tell me why when he did break up with me. By the end of the 2 weeks he reached out to me to tell me what was going on in his mind and how he was scared because he couldn't tell what was real and not real anymore. The voices were telling him I 'thought he was a joke' and 'everybody hated him.'  
It broke my heart when he opened up about what he was dealing with. And if he hadn't opened up to me, I would have lost him to a planned suicide by the end of October.

His mum and I took him to hospital and he was assessed and diagnosed with schizophrenia, then spent 3 weeks in a mental health ward to adjust to his new meds. But it was still hard and confusing and tense at times when he came home. He was still paranoid, told me he couldn't trust me but didn't know why, I watched him breakdown a few times. Didn't want to leave the house.

I knew when I met him, that he was my person. As cliche as it sounds. I'm also a pretty passionate person, I researched the shit out of this condition so I could/can try to understand what life is like for him. I spent almost every day at the hospital with him. Didn't leave his side. I knew that he was still there underneath the paranoia and confusion. I tried to make him feel normal when he didn't feel it in the early days back home from hospital. I've gone to one appointment so far with his psych (COVID-19 restrictions), I'll be going again to the next one in a few weeks because hes getting changed to his long-term meds. 

I wanted him to believe I am not going anywhere. That I wouldn't walk away because of the condition and that we can continue together, and we have. We have a long way to go. He's done an amazing job so far. We can even joke about it (tin foil hats and all that). He's even pretty social again. He has worked hard.

I guess a big part of it for me is trying to be understanding because I know that he has seen the world differently than I have.

I see a lot of recent ideas in the mental illness community that are literally complete nonsense, on every side. Literally someone could argue that your perspective is complete nonsense that is dangerous. And they could be right.

What a person does and what the consequences are... hmm. Taking antipsychotics, gaining a bunch of weight and hating yourself as a result? Convincing people that it's RIGHT to believe that they can be defined and stigmatized by a word for something completely intangible? I tried to commit suicide after being on Zyprexa for a while. It fucked up my memory, my creativity, my intelligence. My diagnosis invalidated who I was, my personality traits that make me the person I am. I'm an artist and have a passion for science and all these things previously stated are very important to me. **I'm not going to go around telling people that being labeled and using medications are good for people. But I also won't discourage someone who thinks medication will help them. BOTH SIDES can hurt/ help people.**

I don't even know what a sock puppet account is, but I am a human being, this is my personal account that I called ""temporarybsacct"" because my first post was an embarrassing vent in the depression subreddit (since deleted)... I tend to comment on mental illness posts because 1. I have had experience with mental illness which has influenced the things I choose to react to. 2. There is a way of thinking in the mental illness community where people believe that one ""side"" is inarguably and factually ""right"" and I think that that is very small unrealistic thinking. 

Also, forgive me for not feeling the need to comment and state my opinion on every single video of a puppy or person playing a synthesizer, and that the history of every single post I view is not available to you so you can see that I'm just a person...

I'm a human being with ambitions, emotions, trauma, joy and so on who has lived through these things, but so are you. I guess you can decide whether to take me seriously or not. But I'm also sick of people not even considering ideas that are outside of the norm for a particular community of people. Even ambiguous ideas that recognize the validity of all sides.

I could say this a billion times, for any human being reading this, in every single situation, THINK FOR YOURSELF. Listen to what other people have to say. They contain an entire world within themselves.

Other hallucinations can be more subtle or vague, like hallucinatory shadows.

You are worth the work it takes to heal. I was on the brink of death for a year and used drugs as an excuse for why I felt horrible, for why I didn't trust anybody or my own mind. Told myself it was just the drugs, not me.

Truth is I wasn't taking care of myself. Drugs were the quick way to a short feel good, but they slowly sapped my life until I had a break for a whole summer and ended up in jail multiple times as a result after being hospitalized multiple times. Finally they kept me in jail until I could go to rehab. It was exactly what I needed and I am thankful now.

What I needed personally was for my freedom to be lost in order for me to see that there was an unbreakable part of me that refused to die. I am a female, was 22 at the time, was only 120 lbs, and it took 5 grown male security guards just told hold me down so they could sedate me at the hospital. I had no idea my will to live was that strong. I have no doubt that I am not the only one with that kind of drive when pushed.

I still wanted to die when I first got clean, but now I'm over 2.5 years clean and I just graduated college with two degrees. It will get better if you stop digging a deeper hole for yourself.

It felt like something just shifted or changed, like my whole life I was living in a dark room and then a light came on. But it was more than that. Our normal conscious mind (where you can think and hear yourself internally) is like the tip of an iceberg, and our subconscious mind is the giant chunk underneath (everything we perceive being collected and gathered and relayed as information). It felt like my awareness of myself was now underneath the iceberg completely, seeing and hearing everything in full force yet feeling so disconnected from it. There were strings of thought and memories constantly flowing over top of each other. The constant noise, imagery and emotion was like a strange collection of things I was looking at, rather than things I was actually feeling and experiencing. it frightened me to my core and made my very being uncomfortable in my body, constantly desiring an escape, but there was none. The constant noise made it so I could no longer even hear my own voice in my thoughts. It got drowned out. All I could do was be crushed by the pressure of suddenly feeling like I was dead. And part of me did die. It was a necessary experience for me to be reborn as myself, as I spent most of my life lost and buried under my own fear, hatred, and many other internal knots and struggles. These experiences for me have been for a few years, they began at 18, currently 23, soon to be 24, and the experiences continue to taper off more and more each passing day. At 18 I was underneath the iceberg, and as time passed it felt like my awareness or sense of self was slowly rising back up to the surface, and now I’m just about at the surface again. I also had a lot of continuous synchronicities as well for a decent amount of time, some stood out more than others. But without a doubt, it’s been an incredibly strange and terrifying experience that has been very trying on the soul. But I’m grateful for these years of struggle, as I’ve become a much more humble and truthful version of myself compared to who I was before these experiences. And just as nature has its seasons, so do our lives. Being in that state caused me to remember many things I had forgotten. Just take one day at a time and know that fear is a lie, and Love is the Truth.

If you can’t think of anything, I have an exercise that might be helpful: it’s called 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique. 
Look around and in detail describe 5 things you can see. Tune into everything in contact with your body (if it’s the feeling of your body touching a chair, the clothes you’re wearing, etc) and name 4 things you can feel.

With a diagnosis of schizophrenia you can get a security clearance, which I think you would need to participate in certain committees, but it's much more difficult. They want to see several years of stability, and measures in place to ensure continued stability.

Getting into political office with a diagnosis of schizophrenia would be really difficult. I wouldn't say that it's impossible, but the stigma is real, and most people don't doubt that the stigma is deserved because they don't understand schizophrenia. Even though you're stable now, the question of whether you would stay so and whether you can be trusted would be called into question by your detractors.

With what kindness the destroyer of worlds looks upon us with

Her pestilence bears forth the sweet, fragrant flowers of death

They bloom on the gentle sleeping bodies of the tender beauties

Do not fear her
