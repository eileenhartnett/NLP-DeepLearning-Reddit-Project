You cover all the things I have been wanting to write about.

No matter, I WANT TO SAY THAT THE WHOLE QUESTION OF **NOT TAKING MEDS** IS A **TOTAL MYTH**!! **THIS IS ISSUE IS BS**!!!

There is a new trend to act 'cool' and somehow believe that taking meds makes you weak, and more importantly fucks you up even more.

**NO I. AM. NOT. PUSHING. MEDS. AS A MIRACLE CURE.**

But meds are so important to the initial steps to making a difference.  They do NOT cure you.  But they take the edge away from whatever your condition is that you then have just that little bit extra mental energy to use to fight back.

The key to success with meds is **DOSAGE**.  Yes, dosage.

Always start with the lowest dosage you can get.  FORCE your doc to go low.  The standard prescribed doses are just way too high for most people since they just start with high side effects.  

Then slowly increase the dose every 2-3 weeks.  Find the dose that works versus the side effects.

Also, READ, READ, READ....read about every drug you are asked to take..........BEFORE YOU TAKE IT.

I went to a private child psychologist since in my area there were no psychologists experienced with Adult autistics.  


First two appointments she thought I seemed more like Schizoid personality disorder. 5 appointments (and lots of tests) later she gave me the diagnosis “Asperger’s syndrome”


I wanted to be sure so I went to the only mental hospital in my city (which is public)


I got there, went to the reception and the lady asked what is my “issue”
They ask for your symptoms, you cannot go there and say “I think I’m autistic”


(It’s the only mental hospital I’ve been to so I don’t know if the same every hospital.)


So then they sent me to the child psychology area (even tho they have psychologists experienced with adults on the spectrum) 


I did some tests. Then I was sent to the child psychiatry unit and did more tests. 


Then I was sent to another psychologist to do other tests. 


Then I got my official diagnosis.

Just a few things about loss and grief, in case they’re in any way helpful;
- there’s no right or wrong way to grieve, just do what you gotta do (it’s totally normal to grieve for a short or long time, to do it publicly or in private, for weird things to remind you of that person, etc.)- you experience is unique and so will your grieving process
- 1hr of crying can be equal to 8hrs of physical labour, so don’t be surprised if you get physically tired from the emotions you’re experiencing
- loss of any kind can have secondary casualties, that’s normal (ie. loss of routine, loss of financial means, etc.)
- local crisis or distress lines may be helpful to have a supportive listening call for the feelings that come us as a result of this loss

As for therapist. I see her in person, I would love one I can just chat with as I'd likely be even a bit more open (something about crying in front of people always makes me hold back a bit) but Medicaid doesn't really cover much, last time I did a 'over the internet' therapist, one session was about 200 dollars (was not covered by insurance) and that's way outside my area of affordability. Sadly voice chat freaks me out too much, it kind of eats at my social anxiety more somehow when I can't see someone to know body language and queues.   
  
I'm a little intimidated by r/loseit I'm not sure if it's like r/keto where you get lambasted for asking questions deemed 'stupid' by the community and I was always afraid to ask anything because they would get rather harsh at times and it's silly but I find I need things sugarcoated a little when I'm changing my lifestyles or make mistakes. Otherwise it becomes this overwhelming feeling that everyone must hate me and I'm better off not saying anything, if that makes sense.

For a busy mom, that may be helpful. There are diff. Types for different situations. Journaling may be helpful, it’s a quicker way to get everything you’re feeling out. Also journaling will help you when you do finally have time to see a therapist because then you’ll have a time line, as well as possible things that make your situation worse. 
Reading in general is always a nice way to take your mind off of things, and is something that can be done with the baby around.
Also there are online counseling resources that you may want to look into. I wouldn’t put it off for too long because you want to be healthy and happy and able to function and do your best for your family. 
Look into mindfulness meditation! It’ll teach you how to be here in the present and let everything kind of just go by. As a busy mom this may be helpful dealing with the every day stressors or Work, and parenthood and life in general.
Exercising is always a good way to let go of pent up emotions. Even just 5 mins of cardio or yoga could be beneficial.

I basically got to the point where I was forced to address my perfectionism issues and let it go. I don't even remember what exactly I've done to address it, basically it has just been a process of ""letting it go"" every time my perfectionism has reared its ugly head which has made it lessen more and more as time has gone on. Why do you feel the need to do everything perfectly? What belief is driving your perfectionism? That is probably what you need to begin with. Because you likely have some sort of belief about yourself that makes you feel the need to be a perfectionist. It can also stem from childhood ""wounds"" a lot of the time, for example when people in your life made you feel like you weren't good enough so now you try to prove that you can be good enough by doing everything perfectly. You need to come to terms with the fact that it's okay to not do things perfectly. You need to learn to be okay with making mistakes.

JessTheTwilek,1510156496.0,,,,,,,,t2_hzqppxw,"So, I completely agree with quindi and have a little to add. Many of the things that the therapist did are totally normal and actually required by the ethics guidelines for therapists. Specifically, ethically he can't be both of your personal therapists. It's unethical because it would put all of you in a compromising situation and he may be forced to pick sides, which is unhealthy in a therapist-client relationship. Since he was her therapist first, he is required to refer you to a colleague. 

I think it could be good for you to go see the therapist. Just because the first one was dickish to you, that doesn't mean that the other therapist won't be a good, unbiased counselor that can help you. You could even tell him about the other therapist and how he made you feel. I personally am glad that I went to the second therapist that my first therapist recommended to me: The first one was a bit of a jerk to me, but the second one was amazing and really helped me turn my life around.

As for you and your gf breaking up, I can see how it could possibly be hard for her to work on her own issues and yours as a couple at the same time. It's a lot of effort to change your life. I think that if you worked on your own in therapy it is possible that you could eventually both be healthier, leading to you two having a relationship. But, even if it doesn't, it would help you deal with the loss and help you be the best possible version of yourself.

quietlyliving,1526568281.0,,,,,,,,t2_1e0e6pl1,"I completely understand how you feel. Trust me. I'd been in a toxic relationship for 2 and a half years before it ended 3 months ago. Reading this broke my heart because you are literally describing my experience from a few months ago. Please read what i'm about to share with you, i hope it will help you. Just like you, i gave this guy everything i had. I had all of my firsts with him, first kiss, first sex, you name it. I didn't care about what his actions or this relationship did to me, all i cared about was him, and how he felt. People around me kept trying to communicate with me, telling me that i deserved much better, and even telling me that they don't recognize me anymore, that they don't see me happy. They were genuinely worried about me and my mental health, but i didn't see it. I didn't want to see it. Just like you, i didn't listen to them or the voice inside my head, telling me that this is wrong. I truly loved him, with all my pure intentions. I fell hard. But I couldn't see that he didn't deserve this. Even when he cheated on me, treated me like garbage, i didn't see it. I made excuses in my head, i told people that i know him better than they do. I didn't listen at all. And I damaged my relationship with the people closest to me, with my family because of this. Like you're describing, i had constant breakdowns, sometimes around him or when i'm alone. I don't remember how many times i've cried myself to sleep because of the stress that this toxicity caused.  You saying that you might have a heart attack from the stress makes me tear up, because that's exactly how i felt, and i know what an awful and helpless feeling it is. But still, I didn't see that this relationship was the cause of all this, I thought that this relationship was all i had. He was all i had, and i had to hold on to him as strongly as possible. I couldn't have been more wrong. This went on for two and a half years, until he damaged me dramatically, causing me trauma. I then finally realized that this was killing me, and i had to end it. I hated myself that I still cared about him, when he didn't care about me, which was difficult to accept. But let me tell you what I've learned and realized since i broke up with him. I was manipulated. For the longest time, i thought to myself ""i know he's not treating me well but he has problems and he actually means well"" etc. etc. I learned that no matter the reason, he didn't have the right to treat me like garbage. Actions speak louder than words. He told me that i'm the love of his life hundreds of times, but you don't treat the love of your life like that. You deserve, at least the same ammount of affection and love that you give the other person. Toxic relationships can be really damaging. But once you get out of it, after you give yourself time, i promise you, you will discover yourself and your self worth. And i can promise you, your breakdowns will slowly reduce, if not fade away. I swear, reading your post made me tear up. It's funny how i've been through almost exactly the same thing. I also wanna say that i know how angry at yourself you might be feeling. But you only had good intentions, and you acted on love and care. None of it is your fault. We should always try to learn from the things we experience, and grow stronger slowly. Please feel free to message me whenever you want to, about anything. You're not alone, and you made me feel like i'm not alone either, so thank you for that. Lastly, try to listen to the people who care about you, and talk to them. Don't be ashamed or afraid of what they're gonna say, just talk to them. Trust me, it helps a lot. And don't settle for this, please. You can experience much MUCH better things, and you deserve a whole lot better.

That's great that you still have hope. That's what we have to hold onto and focus on. And it's phenomenal that you made an appointment! That is a huge step forward that just showcases your bravery. It is scary, though. I personally had a bad experience with the last therapist I saw, but I believe it is a rare case, and that the majority truly will do their best to help. If she is a good psychotherapist, she will not judge you. If she does, she isn't doing her job and that isn't your fault.

I really appreciate your informative response. I currently take propranolol and Zoloft (actually sertaline) daily. I do wonder if maybe those will help with the dopamine levels that the strattera wouldn't, although not a stimulant.

Also paradoxical, is that becoming addicted to a mind altering substance again is terrifying to me, meanwhile I'm taking 3 prescribed mind altering medications. I guess it's the lesser of two evils as they're healthier and non addictive. Ideally I can ween off them when I can get my life back on track.

What scares me about ridalyn ot adderall, is my mind is telling me that's what I should ask for. But my conscious mind feels that's just wanting the high that comes with it along with the benefit of increased focus. I'm not sure which is true, in fact it's hard to differentiate. Maybe the ""high"" is just how normal people think, but maybe the high is looking for an escape from my current mood. I'm excited at the prospect of my thoughts finally slowing down and focusing, and if the stimulants prove to be the most effective (if strattera doesnt work) that worries me. The overthinking was a big part of why I drank as much as I did, just to be able to shut my brain off. But here's to hoping the strattera does the job and I can start to live life again!

TrontRaznik,1510997567.0,,,,,,,,t2_lbeg2ki,"Roughly 70% of people with ADD respond to the first stimulant they're prescribed.  90% respond to the second (stats taken from Comer's *Abnormal Psychology*).  So in short, prognosis looks good.  People with ADD who finally get treated often say that it's like a light has been switched on that's been switched off their whole lives.

The only caveat here is that Strattera has somewhat less efficacy than the more prototypical stimulants like Adderal and Ritalin.  It still works, but it might not work quite as well, and it takes around 3 weeks to kick in.  If in a couple months you're not doing better, then talk to your doc about switching off to something else.  

Note that while Strattera is marketed as a non-stimulant, its mechanism of action indirectly increases the amount of norepinephrine available to the postsynaptic neuron.  This is still a stimulating effect, it's just not stimulating in the exact same way as e.g. amphetamines, which increase both dopamine and norepinephrine (and which also may modulate serotonin or act on serotonin receptors directly).  

I know you're worried about addiction, but if taken as prescribed (i.e. no snorting and no increasing dosage without talking to doc), these medications tend not to be addictive in the sense that alcohol is.  There is some abuse potential, but it's just something you have to be very cautious about.

spacec9,,,,,,,,,,"Hi there!
First of all I am sorry that you're going through this, I know from experience how fucked up it feels.  
 You are right that the fear you are experiencing right now is making it harder to get back to normal.  

Depersonalization is -simply put- an alternative to the fight/flight response, caused by intense amounts of anxiety and/or emotional stress. (I'm guessing you already know that, but I'll mention it anyway.) And it seems like the fear of the condition itself, fear of it being permanent, fear of it escalating into something new and terrible only prolongs the symptoms. 

Constant introspection and self-observation is what you want to avoid. Constant focus on symptoms and whats ""off"" compared to before only makes it worse. Your anxiety levels needs to go down, and working on acceptance is important I think. Cognitive Behavior Therapy might help. meditation might help (learning to sit back and observe without engaging in thoughts and feelings that arise) I've also heard that biofeedback can be beneficial. Engaging with something physical and focus your attention on it regularly like an exercise of some sorts might also help. Reassuring yourself that everything still is like it always used to, only your perception is off, can be useful. It is easy to start believing that nothing is real when the symptoms persist for a long time. That's all I have, I guess. I hope it gets better for you soon.

I also refused meds cause I didn't like the side effects and 'thought' if pyschodymanic therapy is helping it and that is all to do with one's childhood then.......why meds. 

But I was close to suicide and non functional so meds took the edge off and allowed me to do the therapy.

They can then help you medically and maybe refer you to a therapist,(again assuming there are some underlying mental health issues). But also, stop worrying about finding out exactly who you and take that pressure off yourself. Stop thinking about who you used to be and build on who you are now.

It's hard enough to seek help now, imagine how much more difficult it will be for teenagers or young adults to get the help they know they need when they have to fear being locked away. The institutions Trump was referring to were shut down because they were dehumanizing. Patients were stripped of all basic human rights and lived in absolutely disgusting conditions. The places that are around now are better, but there is still an awful lot of room for improvement. There are group home type places for people that can not live independently or are a danger to themselves or others. Start there. Improve it. The people that are hired to run the Patients' day to day lives are paid very low wages, and have no experience in psychology or any medical field. A GED or high school diploma is the only requirement. The patients' only see a psychiatrist maybe once a month for 20 minutes. If you check yourself in to a hospital doctors have 72 hours to diagnose you, medicate you or adjust your medications, and come up with a treatment plan. During those 72 hours you'll talk with a psychiatrist maybe once for a brief amount of time. We don't need mental institutions brought back. We need to improve the system that's already there.

First of all, HAPPY (late) BIRTHDAY!!! People forgetting/diminishing your birthday can be really painful, especially because you don’t want to be self-centered in your expectations. I totally understand that struggle, and I’m sorry the day/week wasn’t joyful.

To me, it sounds like you’re experiencing a textbook Major Depressive Episode. Here is the diagnostic criteria from the DSM-V:

”The individual must be experiencing five or more symptoms during the same 2-week period and at least one of the symptoms should be either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.

1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day.
2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day.
3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day.
4. A slowing down of thought and a reduction of physical movement (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
5. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
6. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day.
7. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day.
8. Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.”

Obviously, self-diagnosis is often very inaccurate, but hopefully this list will give you a better idea of if you are suffering from some form of psychological deviance or not. If your feelings are persistent, it would be a fantastic idea to talk them over with your parents and, ultimately, a physician or therapist if necessary.

Gazpacho_Catapult,1481519969.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_13i637,"Good psychiatrists are indeed difficult to find, but remember you don't have to take anything you don't want to. My last psychiatrist tried to put me on Ambien as well, but I knew its side effect profile and promptly told him it wasn't going to happen, and I'd prefer a highly sedating benzo, he objected, but eventually wrote the script. Consultation is collaborative, and the buck still stops with you.  

You can get 99% of drugs from a general practitioner, psychiatrists just specialise in psychoactive medications, so are generally more informed and therefore usually the best option (if you can afford them), but a GP is loads cheaper and there's more to choose from. If you're only after a repeat of old scripts, I'd start with a GP, especially if you have any of the old prescriptions; just take them in and say you've run out (and hope they don't notice the dates), or explain the situation and have a discussion about your long term treatment options.  
If you can find a good GP, you don't necessarily have to demand what you're already on, you can just explain your history with ADHD, and that Adderall worked for you in the past, but disturbed your sleep, so you were put on Ambien, but leave the decision up to them. That way you don't come across as drug seeking, and the GP can decide on what to prescribe, again, a good one will work *with* you.  

There are some alternatives to what you're after, Adderall has several isomers that have the same mechanism of action (though they're all prone to abuse), and Ambien is just a strong sedative, you can get similar effects from benzos, milder Z-Drugs, even antihistamines; all of which the GP may be more comfortable prescribing with a stimulant.  

You're not doing anything wrong here. As long as you're not selling the stuff, you're completely within your rights to just front up to GPs and ask for what you need until you find one that will acquiesce.

It's a hard one to reply to because I don't have a heap of info. So please feel free to point out anything I say that doesn't fit.

Often I notice that the people that are comfortable with being treated like rubbish, are the people who have very low self worth.

And that makes perfect sense.

For example, if someone handed you some rubbish, maybe an empty chip packet, you're probably going to throw it in the trash. You're not going to frame it, or cherish it for the rest of your life, etc... Because you see no value in it.

But if someone handed you a suitcase with a million dollars in it, or a baby, or a diamond necklace, etc... you're not going to just throw it in the trash. Because you see it's value, so you make sure you keep it safe and looked after.

It is an incredibly uncomfortable and unnatural thing to care about and look after something that you see as worthless.

It can feel natural, comfortable, and even right to have something you view as worthless, treated badly.

The trick that depression is really good at pulling off, is making worthwhile people feel worthless. And it does this by focusing you only on your faults.

It's like you're in a dark room and depression is controlling the flash light, only shinning the light on the spots in the room that are horrible. But while it's doing that you can't focus on or see the things in the room that are valuable. You lose who you really are.

When depression does this year after year in your life, you start to believe at your core that you are worthless.

I had one client share yesterday their story of recovering from domestic violence at the hands of a partner that at one stage nearly killed them. I asked what they had learned now that they were 2 years out of the relationship, and they shared that their biggest lesson was that not having self respect makes it easier to accept the lack of respect from others.

They also shared how when they don't take control of their life, something else or someone else will take control of their life. Whether that's their mental health taking control, or an abusive partner taking control.

I'm wondering what your thoughts are?

This is just from personal experience, but I was on seroquel for about 6 months, and during that time I was plagued with nightmares and sleep paralysis. It really messed my sleep up for awhile. I’m not suggesting you stop taking seroquel, but maybe talk to your doctor about what’s happening and see what they suggest.

I also recommend trying out meditation before bed. It’s nothing super crazy, I usually just get comfy, close my eyes and count up to 100, and back down to 1. You can also try breathing exercises. Meditation before bed can help with lucid dreaming, in which you are aware of your dream and can usually change/alter it to your liking. Basically, if you learn to lucid dream, you can stop having nightmares (this is what has helped me the most).

I don't want to go to therapy ""for me"" - but I want therapy to work and I really do try. But mainly I want to go to therapy to improve whatever is wonky that's making people tell me I need to get help, and my anxiety which is terrible. My boyfriend goes to therapy and he's working well with his therapist and she told him to write down what triggers his anxiety and he suggested I do that... I went off a bit on him because I don't know what triggers my anxiety most of the time. I'll be at work doing what I do all day every day and just start to feel the anxiety creep up and have a full on panic attack, and I just force myself to breathe and keep working till it's over, zero known trigger, and it happens daily, multiple times. That's the biggest thing that impairs me, my gad, sad, and panic disorder. And it's the only dx besides obsessive compulsive disorder that's been consistent throughout all my therapists and psychiatrists.

Oxgeos,,,,[],,,,text,t2_e9wmea4,"Been there. I can tell you what worked for me. I wasn't very knowledgable at the time of how to get help with no money or insurance. I learned that cause of my situation I would qualify for Medicaid. Thanks to that I was able to finally see a psych. At this point I was so desperate for my life that I finally let go of my fears in meeting one, I wish I hadn't been so afraid for so long in retrospect. I guess it's how it is with people like you and I, we have to hit rock bottom to finally get our heads out of our asses. I called the nearest well reviewed psysch, unfortunately the wait was almost 2 months to see him. But thankfully the receptionist was amazing and gave me a suggestion that I call the local crisis center(UHNJ) and tell them my situation and that cause it's a crisis(based on my word alone, that's all you need.) they would get me to a psych in 2 weeks. It would be 8 sessions for 4 weeks. 6 of them with a clinician and 2 with a psych. I did it and they saw my pain and how much I was struggling, they asked me if I wanted meds to help until we figured more about me to find a better solution. I took it because well, I WAS IN REALLY BAD SHAPE. They helped a lot manage through the following weeks. After my sessions were over they asked me how I felt the support they gave went and what was the last thing they can do for me. Like continuing therapy else where in a professional office.

Check this out if I hadn't gone to this crisis center, I would've waited almost two months to see a so-so psychiatrist who was expense. The crisis center got me help immediately and found me a place that I was happy with where I can continue my therapy which took just a week to go to an appointment. I got super fucking lucky! Because it turns out this place had a super in demand psych, a Yale grad, one of the best in the tristate area who has 3 practices in 3 states who was essentially doing volunteer work at this practice, her going rate at her private practice is a crazy number for just half hour. At this place though it's just 70 bucks for 45 minutes which she usually let's you stay for an hour no extra charge.

This lady has changed my fucking life. This person speaking to you today is the best version of me in my whole life. I didn't know this person today could exist, that I could be who I am today. I went from literally starving to death, major depressed, suicidal, homeless and in extreme poor physical health to a person who goes to the gym 3 to 4 times a week. Who eats a super healthy diet everyday. Who's super social again. Who can critical think like a super power. Who volunteers to help the homeless. Who's on his path to pursue a passion it's taken his whole life to discover, to join the system and be a case worker and work my way up so that I can improve the system and helps others genuinely with no judgement because that's what these homeless people need. Someone who can truly empathize. I work two jobs. I have no problems dating when I want.

I don't want to sound like i'm bragging. But what I want to illuminate  is this, I started where you are at right now, I even used reddit before I got help. I was afraid. I took a leap and this is where I believe, no where I know you can get to as well. It may take time, it did for me, almost gave up a few times, but I pushed because thanks to therapy it helped me find strength to push. And now I am so happy to be alive. Am I truely happy? No but i'm not stuck in depression, i'm optimistic, I laugh and smile everyday, I look forward to tomorrow, i'm happy with how things are for now and I know what I need to achieve in order to find that fairytale happiness.

Just let them know what’s going on and how they’re making you feel. I don’t know what level of schooling you’re in but most schools have guidance counselors. If talking to your teacher doesn’t help, then I’d go to them next. They can do a lot more than you think, I learned this by personally talking to mine once a week when I was in high school.

hotserialkiller,,,,[],,,,text,t2_2srpqw53,"You've gotta think big picture. Taking a couple weeks and going right back into the fire probably won't do any good. I got myself so burned out I couldn't think or function. I was basically in an endless loop. You've got to take a big step back and identify WHY you're burned out.

 I had to draw some hard boundaries for myself and the people in my life. Some of the things people counted on me for, they had to learn to count on themselves. Over a period of months I drew back to the point that I was pulling my own weight but no one else's. I gave people time to adjust, I didn't just go on strike. That would be unfair.

I had to stop trying to please people. My wife in particular, I had to explain that her being upset of unsatisfied isn't my problem. If she's going to be unhappy, she's not going to get any response from me. If she is unhappy with a situation she should change it instead of putting it on me. 

I had to kick my adult step daughter out. Long story but there's more to life than booze and Instagram. The resentment I held for her and my wife forcing me to support her was a major problem. Nothing I found contributes more to depression than feeling like the people you love are just using you.

The younger kids got a crash course on yard work, household chores, and cooking. They are pulling their weight now instead of me doing it for them. 

My boss got to learn the meaning of the word NO. I don't have to fabricate excuses not to work weekends. I don't want to is a good enough reason. 

I don't know if you have any parallels at all but I think you get my point.

Do you have a source of income that might allow you to step away from school temporarily to collect yourself and refocus on your life? When I was in college, I was having suicidal thoughts as well, and almost attempted it myself. What helped me get through college was being able to travel back home and see my mother. She is the closest family member that I have, and wanting to see her alone gave me enough reason to keep pushing on through. I also saw a university counselor for the entirety of my junior year and part of my senior year in college. It didn't fix my problem entirely, but I was thankful to know that every week I had someone to talk to, even if only for an hour. 

What are some of your goals and aspirations in life? Putting school and stress aside, if you had all of the money you could ever need, how would you spend your life? What are some of the things that interest you and make you happy on a day to day basis? What childhood activities do you remember doing with your friends and family that make you smile? 

Something that helps me through my depression is looking back and doing activities  that made me happy as a child. Things such as hiking, playing in the mud, and running as fast as my legs could carry me. It helped me tremendously to reconnect with nature and re-evaluate what my life really meant to me.

One of my best recommendations is to surround yourself with individuals who want to see you at your best. Surround yourself with people who want to see you shine your brightest. Surround yourself with people who love you unconditionally and want to see you happier than you have ever been.

It is very likely she will encourage you to check in to a hospital of your own free will, but sending you there against your will has certain requirements (I'm assuming you are in the USA).

&amp;#x200B;

Having frequent thoughts about suicide is not enough for hospitalization against will.  Wishing you were dead is not enough for hospitalization against will.  If you do get hospitalized, the most likely amount of time you are there is 72 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

I would encourage you to talk to your therapist.  But hey, I also get your fears. (I used to have to hospitalize people against their will on a regular basis when I worked on a suicide hotline).  You might start by talking about how you felt ""very suicidal"" last week but didn't end up killing yourself and didn't end up telling her either and why.  Then together you can go over the issues at play with the safety of it being something in the past.  You won't get hospitalized for feeling suicidal a week ago unless you indicate you are suicidal again and have intent to act upon it.

I've since realised that my parents have a knack for teaching their children to be extremely moralistic and rigid in 'good vs evil' thinking, and that I was acting like a complete asshole to my fellow inpatients. I would constantly nag them about smoking and point out how some of the things that they did were illegal, until I basically got the shit kicked outta me. Eventually I learned that the world wasn't entirely black-and-white and that you can't control people's minds, but not before people around me started literally throwing things at me and having psychotic breaks when I tried to talk to them. Bear in mind that I was still only 14 by this point. 

I saw some shit in that ward which I can't unsee, but the lessons that I learnt have enabled me to actually be a functioning member of society instead of a judgemental asshole like my brother can sometimes be.

As you’re well aware there is gonna be a lot going on in your head right now. And the way you’re reacting is completely understandable. So don’t get mad at yourself for it if you can help it. 

But as for ways to help reduce these feelings and to get to a happier place I would recommend doing a few things and see what works for you. 

Starting a journal is a good idea. You can put your thoughts and emotions into paper to help understand them better but to also help process them and get them out of your head. They can be happy and sad. You can do whatever you want to do with it. Draw write stick photos in. Whatever. 

Finding a passion or going back to a previous passion is another good one.  I imagine you’re maybe feeling unmotivated and possibly hopeless. Finding enjoyment in little things such as listening to an old favourite album or say you used to exercise a lot. Starting doing that again. That can really help. It can bring routine back into your life and give you some purpose if you feel you’ve lost it 

Talk to someone professional or even just close by. Although it’s great you’ve reached out to Reddit for advice. But Having regular sessions with a counsellor or therapist will be really beneficial. Hopefully you have an adult close by you can talk to about these things. Maybe they’ll be able to help you start talking to someone. But if not there are plenty f great online services to give you advice on starting the process if you feel you’re ready for it. It can be a really scary thing. But it’s there for you when you’re ready for it

Isicium,,,,[],,,,text,t2_33bcb9tq,"dear OP,
this sounds pretty severe, glad you‘re reaching out for help!
obviously professional help would be the best option but you‘ve mentioned that you cannot see a therapist.
like I said, it sounds like you‘re really stuck deep in there but that does not mean that there is no way out! I am everything but an expert but what I would like to suggest is that you definitively DON‘T try not to eat anything for a couple of days because that can be counterproductive, as you‘ve written yourself. 
What else have you tried so far? Have you tried replacing the unhealthy foods you eat when already full and unhappy by fruits or nuts? Have you tried teaming up with a friend who might want to lose weight as well and start going for walks or other activities together? (this will also take away some of the time you might otherwise spend eating) Have you used an App to track your eating behaviour? Are you cooking yourself? You might try not to eat anything processed but instead cook everything yourself, so you will appreciate it more and you will also spend some time being busy! And do you have someone who can support you in this, like your parents or friends?

I feel like it‘s not very helpful but are these approaches you might want to think about?",,,,,1562904832,,,etkpxxu,False,t3_cc5wqm,,True,t3_cc5wqm,/r/mentalhealth/comments/cc5wqm/my_relationship_with_food_is_destroying_me/etkpxxu/,,1562904833,2,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,,,,,,False,{},1562991229.0,[],False,0.0,,,,,,,

Up-Town,,,,[],,,,text,t2_oi79uhv,"&gt;**i have such a difficult time keeping relationships (both intimate and  platonic), but i had no idea it was related to my self identity.** 

Non-Non, no scientist has proven to a certainty WHAT it is that causes your particular issues to develop in early childhood. As I discussed above, the prevailing theory is that a trauma and/or inherited gene caused you to be so overwhelmed at about age 4 that you had no opportunity to develop an integrated self image. That's likely why you continue relying too heavily on black-white thinking and are loath to admit a mistake (because you will immediately perceive of yourself as ""all bad"").

This halt in your self development, however, likely interfered with more than your development of a self image.  It also likely stopped your development of important coping skills.  Because you were holding onto the primitive ego defenses with a death grip in order to survive, you were too afraid to let go of them to learn how to replace them with more mature defenses:  i.e., the coping skills that are required to be able to better control your own emotions.

 Your inability to regulate your emotions means that you cannot keep your two fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- in check.  They therefore frequently flare up, causing very intense feelings.  This creates a world of grief for you in close relationships because it makes it impossible for you to clearly evaluate your partner's intentions.

The human condition is that, whenever we experience very intense  feelings, our judgment flies out the window because those strong  feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples' intentions  and motivations. Significantly, this is true for ALL adults. 

Most of us understood this well by the time we entered high school. This is why, whenever we are very angry, we all try hard to keep our  mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to  cool down. We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are  experiencing intense feelings.

Well, a person with a fragile ego and little emotional control is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions  occur far more frequently because he lacks the coping skills needed  to regulate his own emotions. This means that a pwBPD experiences very  intense feelings far more frequently than other people.

&gt;**Would you recommend me meeting a psychiatrist to put in a final word on it?** 

Yes, absolutely. You are describing some classic warning signs for BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder).  If you're interested, I describe BPD red flags at my list of [18 BPD Warning Signs](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9hv2yq/what_are_the_primary_warning_signs_for_bpd/).  Of course, learning  to spot these warning  signs will not  enable you to   diagnose your own issues.  Although strong BPD  symptoms may be easy for you to  spot,  only a  professional can determine whether  they are so   severe and  persistent  as to constitute a  full-blown  disorder. 

I also caution that BPD is not  something --   like chickenpox -- that a   person either ""has""  or  ""doesn't have.""    Instead, it is a spectrum  disorder, which means every adult on the   planet occasionally   exhibits  all BPD  traits  to  some degree  (usually at  a low level if the  person is  healthy). Moreover, even healthy adults can occasionally get a temporary flareup of BPD traits that usually is caused by a hormone surge or drug abuse.

At  issue, then, is  not  whether you exhibit BPD traits.   Of  course you do. We  all do. Rather, at issue is whether you  exhibit those traits at a  strong and  persistent  level  (i.e., are on  the  upper end  of  the BPD   spectrum). Not  having met you, I  cannot answer that question. 

Hence, if you decide you may be exhibiting most BPD traits at a strong level, it would be prudent to obtain a professional evaluation ASAP from a psychologist.  If the psych determines that you have persistent BPD, he will refer you to a professional who teaches the missing skills.

Fortunately, most major cities offer  excellent treatment programs (e.g., DBT, TFP, and CBT) that can teach a pwBPD the coping skills needed to regulate his own emotions and strengthen his self image. They can teach how to do self soothing; how to intellectually challenge intense feelings instead of  accepting them as ""facts""; and how to trust others.

They also can teach how to be ""mindful"" (i.e., to remain in the  room instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future); how to  perceive ""object constancy"" (i.e., to see that your partner's  personality is essentially unchanged day to day); and how to avoid  black-white thinking by learning to tolerate strong mixed feelings,  uncertainties, ambiguities, and the other gray areas of interpersonal  relationships.

Absent those skills, you must continue to rely on the primitive ego  defenses used by young children: projection, denial, temper tantrums,  magical thinking, and black-white thinking. Importantly, ALL adults occasionally exhibit those primitive ego defenses when under great stress, experiencing a hormone change, or abusing drugs.  Hence, a pwBPD differs from a healthy adult only in degree -- not in kind.",,,,,1562901416,,,etklssb,False,t3_cc39pb,,True,t1_etkgdfz,/r/mentalhealth/comments/cc39pb/feel_like_i_dont_have_a_personality/etklssb/,,1562901417,4,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,,,,,,False,{},1562987817.0,[],False,0.0,,,,,,,

Up-Town,,,,[],,,,text,t2_oi79uhv,"Non-Non, you definitely have a personality. Everyone does. What is at issue, then, is how well integrated your personality is.  In our early childhood before age 5, most of us learn to integrate the good and bad aspects of our personality into a cohesive whole: a child recognizes that he is not an ""all bad"" boy when doing something bad -- and is not an ""all good"" boy when doing something good. 

Rather, he realizes that he is an ""essentially good boy who sometimes does bad things."" In that way, the child has learned how two integrate his good and bad aspects into a cohesive strong personality.  A substantial share of children, however, never have the opportunity to do this. 

Due to heredity and/or a childhood trauma (e.g., abuse or abandonment) before age 5, the child has to hold on so tightly to the primitive ego defenses -- for survival -- that he never has a chance to integrate his fractured self image into a strong, cohesive self identity.

When this occurs in childhood, you can grow up having such a weak sense of identity that you will automatically rely on people around you for cues as to how you should behave.  Because this ""mirroring"" of other peoples' personalities starts at a young age, it will seem perfectly natural to you when you enter adolescence. Yet, because you know this mirroring is not the ""real you,"" you will have a gut-level feeling that you somehow are not being genuine and that your apparent personality is ""fake.""  

On the other hand, such behavior does offer some advantages.  For one thing, it allows you to feel like you are fitting in, being accepted, and being loved.  For another, it allows you to move effortlessly among a wide diversity of social groups.  You likely will be just as comfortable, e.g., talking with a biker gang as you would be talking with a group of nerds or college jocks.

The main disadvantage of having a weak self identity is that it results in two great fears.  One of these is a fear of abandonment.  This occurs because you live in fear that, as soon as your partner discovers how empty and fake you are on the inside, she will immediately abandon you. 

The other fear is that of engulfment.  It occurs because, absent a strong sense of self, you have a very weak sense of personal boundaries. That is, you have great trouble determining where YOUR problems/feelings leave off and those of your PARTNER begin.  This unhealthy enmeshment of her feelings/problems with your own will cause a lot of pain whenever you draw close to her in intimacy.

Granted, you likely crave intimacy like nearly every other adult. Yet, because you lack personal boundaries and a strong self image, you probably cannot tolerate intimacy for very long.  After an intimate evening or great weekend, for example, you will start feeling -- at a subconscious level -- that you are being suffocated or somehow ""controlled"" by your partner. Indeed, you may even get a very uncomfortable feeling of losing yourself, becoming enmeshed in her strong personality.

Sadly, if you do have these two fears, you and your partner cannot avoid frequently triggering both fears -- regardless of whether you draw near to each other or move farther away. This conundrum is due to the position of your two great fears -- abandonment and engulfment -- at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means you often find yourself in a lose/lose situation because, as your partner backs away from one fear to avoid triggering it, she will start triggering your fear at the other end of that same spectrum.

Your predicament is that the solution to calming your abandonment fear (drawing close to each other and being intimate) is the very action that triggers your engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming your engulfment fear (her moving back away to give you breathing space) is the very action that triggers your abandonment fear.

Hence, as she moves close to comfort you and assure you of her love, she eventually will start triggering your engulfment fear, making you feel like you're being suffocated and controlled by her -- or, even worse, making you feel like you're losing your identity in her strong personality. It can be a scary feeling of disappearing into thin air.  Yet, as she backs away to give you breathing space, she soon will find that she has started triggering your abandonment fear.

In my 15 years with my exW, I found that there is no midpoints solution -- between ""too close"" and ""too far away""-- where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwBPD learns how to strengthen his self identity and build strong personal boundaries, that Goldilocks position will not exist. This is why your relationships likely exhibit a repeating cycle of push-you-away and pull-you-back.

Does this description of your behavior sound accurate and ring many bells?  If so and you have questions, I would be glad to discuss them with you.",,,,,1562895481,,,etkdwd8,False,t3_cc39pb,,True,t3_cc39pb,/r/mentalhealth/comments/cc39pb/feel_like_i_dont_have_a_personality/etkdwd8/,,1562895483,10,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,,,,,,False,{},1562981877.0,[],False,0.0,,,,,,,

One day I was literally fraught with suicidal ideation—I couldn’t stop fantasizing about how death is truly the only and best option. Being an intelligent person, and knowing that it was a movement of the mind rather than me being on the verge of really committing suicide, I thought, “why don’t I call the suicide hotline to see if they can have a conversation about this.” It was a Sunday afternoon. I called and was placed on hold. In 12 minutes of waiting, I was disconnected. So I called back and was put on hold again. This time, I was disconnected in about 7 minutes. At that point I actually laughed out loud. The absurdity of calling the suicide hotline and being hung up on twice?!?!?! So, third times a charm right? I tried one more time. This time, I was put on hold and disconnected within 3 minutes. I didn’t try calling back—I mean, what would be the point? If I had been attempting suicide, the hotline had already failed. 

And yet, when I see anything related to Suicide Awareness, the only thing people have to say is, call the suicide hotline—they can help.

Training exercises for my memory, an app called Questions to focus on what makes me feel certain things without having to be vulnerable in front of anyone, solitaire to help me make decisions a little quicker, and favorite songs/tones from Zedge that have a pretty good chance of making me smile when I'm not doing so great. There are also several apps especially created with these issues in mind that you can binge download and see if any of them stick. It may not be an instant solution, but I hope it helps bring you peace. Though it's absurdly cliche, you are not alone in any of this.

I hope your mom has someone that she can talk to. If she is exhibiting signs of paranoia she should consider seeing a mental health professional. However, if she does not choose to get help, it is hard to actually do much.

My advice is to try to keep in contact with her. And like you said, you might consider talking to her a little more than once every other week. Maybe try to get your siblings to talk to her a little more too. You don't have to text her every day either.   


If her paranoia worsens or she is exhibiting signs of depression or any other mental illness, you should really try to convince her to get help.

No pens. No spiral-bound notebooks. They can and will search your stuff. (That being said, it's definitely possible to hide stuff. I don't advise it though.) They always give grippy socks. They supply toiletries. You're usually allowed to shave, you just have to get permission and have someone supervise you. People typically wear sweatpants and comfy clothes. You don't actually have to try to get better, you just have to act like you are and they'll discharge you (again, I don't recommend this). They do 15 minute checks. Meaning someone had a piece of paper and they have to lay eyes on all of the patients every 15 minutes and write down what they're doing. If they can't find you for one 15 minute check, they're allowed to skip you and just find you for the next one. Most of them don't do this though, they just keep looking until they find you. You're always monitored. If you're deemed a 'fall-risk' you have someone follow you around and help you walk from place to place. They can also have someone give you one-on-one supervision if it's deemed necessary, like if you're being violent or dangerous or something. They do have the padded room, but no straight jacket. People don't get sent there very often though. They can also sedate you with an injection to the ass if they need to. When you take your meds, they're supposed to make you open your mouth to prove you swallowed them, but not everyone does this. Refusing treatment (such as participating in groups, taking meds, etc.) makes you stay longer.

remyymer13,,,,[],,,,text,t2_4kxu5j11," The third time, it was February. I was at home with my friend (same person) and two other friends. We were chilling and doing homework. Apparently I was acting kind of worryingly. I took the dog on a walk and I guess I was gone for a long time and they got worried. I came back and it was kind of tense. I put the dog inside and then left again. My friend came after me and we talked for a moment. We went back up and were about to go into the apartment when I ran in the opposite direction. My friend called the other friend to come help. One of them got in the car and the other chased me on foot. I was running down the street and my friend was screaming my name. I felt bad because of how distressed she sounded so I stopped running. We went over to a picnic bench and sat down. I tried to run again but she pinned me down. My two friends and I talked for a bit and then they took me to the emergency room in the next town over, where they have a psychiatric ward in the hospital. I was admitted voluntarily this time. I sat in the ER until a psychiatrist could evaluate me. Funnily enough, it was the same psychiatrist from the hospital from last time. The two hospitals were part of the same network or something. I was admitted. I was strip searched again, but it was less intense this time. No squatting. After that, it was much of the same. I had my own room and my own bathroom this time. I was a lot closer to home so it was a bit weirder. I was there at the same time as another student from my university. Also students from the university came to lead one of the groups. One thing about this- HIPPA didn't seem to mean much. I was talking to one of the nurses and she told me that a professor from my university had been there and was just discharged. Anyway, we had groups, I saw the psychiatrist individually, I saw a case worker individually, we came up with a plan for discharge and for staying safe. Since it was February and it was really cold outside, we didn't get the chance to go to the outdoor patio (see a pattern here? lol). The food was good. We were given menus each day and we got to circle what we wanted for our next meals. Visiting hours were every day. My friend came to visit every day. I was eventually discharged.

For a fourth time, in March, some more events led to the police looking for me. I didn't know they were looking for me at the time. They didn't find me. I later went into a psych ward as a visitor, to visit a friend (the same one). So I was then escorted down to the ER by a psychiatrist and three security guards. My friend's experience: They were sent to a kind of psych holding place. It was a hallway lined with little rooms that were closed off by curtains. Each room had a bed, a chair and a TV. They had to wait there until they could be evaluated by a psychiatrist. I stayed there as long as they would let me. My friend stayed there overnight. I went back the next morning as soon as they would let me and stayed up until the moment my friend had been evaluated and admitted to the actual ward. At this place, visiting hours were every day. There were three different times of day you could visit. They had long phone hours as well. So here's my experience: I was marched down to the ER and changed into scrubs. The psych holding place that I had been to before was full, so they took me somewhere else. It was dimly lit, the walls were soft, it was cold. It just wasn't a good time. The other place was bright, had happy colors everywhere, there were magazines and coloring books and crayons. This place had nothing. There was a TV but I didn't know how to turn it on. There were two other people there. One old lady that would try to talk to me every once in a while but didn't make much sense. A young guy that would periodically shout and that heard voices. They gave me a coloring page and some colored pencils. I had no way to contact anyone. Usually they give you a chance to get phone numbers from the contacts in your cellphone, but they confiscated my things right away and I didn't get the chance. I was taken there right after phone hours ended and had to wait hours until it was phone hours again. I finally got the chance to call my mom. I also got the chance to call the patient phone in the ward upstairs where my friend was (I was in the basement or something). We talked for a moment but the nurses were listening to my friend so they didn't say much. Finally, the psychiatrist came to evaluate me. She already had lots of info on me but still had to evaluate me. She said that someone was concerned about me to the point of involuntarily committing me to the psych holding place to be evaluated. I'm still not clear on the legality of this. She kept telling me that I had to tell the truth and that she would know if I didn't because she was trained to be a human lie detector because of the nature of her work. I lied my ass off. She let me go home and told me that she could tell I had been telling the truth because of how genuine I had been. Yeah right lady. (Looking back, I wish I had told the truth. I recommend telling the truth and getting the help you need. I lied and continued to struggle as a result because I refused to get help. Don't be like me please.) I went home.

(The story behind the fourth time for those who are interested: My friend was in the psych ward. I wasn't doing so great mental health-wise on the outside. I went to visit every day even though it was a little over an hour from my house. One day I went to visit in the morning and I stuck around until lunchtime visiting hours as well. Well, I didn't have anything to do during the in-between time. I walked around the hospital a bit then went and sat in my car in the parking deck. I talked to my friend on the phone during phone hours. I was saying some worrying stuff. TW:&gt;!I had a bottle of pills and a bottle of water and I also had intent.!&lt; My friend tried to talk me out of it but I hung up on them. After I hung up, I realized they were right. I put the things away and went inside to visit instead. Once I got there, I waited for a long long time. Visiting was in the actual ward, so I just sat there in the ward wondering where my friend was. Meanwhile: Apparently my friend had mentioned something to their psychiatrist about me being depressed TW:&gt;!and a little suicidal as well!&lt;. The psychiatrist took interest and pressed my friend for more info, grilling them. My friend ended up having a panic attack because of this. During all of these questions, the psychiatrist found out about all of the information from earlier. That was enough for her to involuntarily commit me to the psych holding place I guess. She came out to where I was sitting, along with three security guards. They didn't tell me where I was going even though I repeatedly asked, they just kept saying that it was okay. They took me to the basement, where the ER is.)",,,,,1570147696,,,f2d6bzt,False,t3_dcxye0,,True,t1_f2d65qw,/r/mentalhealth/comments/dcxye0/looking_to_hear_from_people_who_have_stayed_at_an/f2d6bzt/,,1570158254,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,,,,,,False,{},,[],False,0.0,[],[],,,,,

I was hanging out on campus with the same friend from before and I got really upset and tried to leave TW:&gt;!(with the intent of committing suicide)!&lt;. My friend noticed that something fishy was going on and wasn't keen on letting me go. We went for a car ride together and ended up parked in a random parking lot on our college campus. I tried to leave again and my friend wouldn't let me. They literally had to restrain me in the car even though I was kicking and biting them. Eventually I got loose and made it out of the car. We were just standing there staring at each other for a moment and they said they were going to call 911. I panicked and ran. They called 911. I kept running for a while and they couldn't find me. Apparently campus police got involved in the search as well. There were 9 police cruisers out looking for me as well as officers on foot and people monitoring security cameras all around campus. I managed to hide from them for an hour. I realized that I was literally running from the police so I sat down and waited for them to come find me. Apparently they saw me on a security camera and then had police officers positioned at all the exits from where I was before anyone approached me. I was taken to the ER where I changed into some weird paper scrubs and was evaluated and involuntarily committed. I stayed overnight before they found somewhere with a bed for me. They handcuffed me and put me in the back of a police car and drove for like an hour and a half to a mental health facility. My friend went home and gathered some of my things before bringing them to the facility where I was. They dropped them off but weren't allowed to come in. Anyways, I was taken inside and made to wait for a long time. I cried so hard one of my contacts came out. I waited for like 2 hours. I later found out that they were severely understaffed due to a blizzard and that's why I waited so long. This time, my parents were involved as well as insurance. This felt more like a 'real' psychiatric facility. I shared a room with one other person and we had a bathroom for the two of us. We were allowed to wear our own clothes and they also gave us grippy socks. If you didn't have clothes they would give you scrubs to wear. They gave us all the toiletries we would need. We had to be strip searched before we were allowed to actually go into the ward. Like, squat-and-cough strip searched. Phone calls were allowed. Visitors were also allowed, but the visiting hours were kinda weird. Visitors were in the cafeteria. They made special arrangements for my parents to come at a different time because they had such a long drive. We had a schedule that we had to stick to every day. We weren't allowed to go out to the outdoor patio because of the blizzard. We had several groups throughout the day. We also saw a doctor and a social worker one-on-one. In our free time we had board games, TV, coloring pages, crayons, markers, etc. We had little tiny golf pencils that were dull and didn't have erasers. Food was served cafeteria-style.

I've been hospitalized three times within the past year, all within four months of each other.

Background: I'm a 19yo ftm college student. I did therapy for several years in high school and also took meds but then stopped shortly before coming to college.

The first time, I chose to go. A friend found a free crisis stabilization unit in the next state over. We drove there together, my friend dropped me off and went back home. At this place, they gave me a set of scrubs and grippy socks to wear. We weren't allowed our own clothes other than a jacket/sweater/hoodie/etc that had to be approved. We weren't allowed to bring any objects in actually. We weren't allowed visitors (you could have your children come for a family therapy session but that was it) but we did have a phone. This place was really low-budget and was funded from grants. It also specialized in co-occurring disorders, meaning substance abuse issues along with mental health issues. It was really small and didn't have very many beds. We slept with three people to a room. The room only had three beds and was pretty spacious though. There was one men's bathroom with a toilet and a shower and one women's bathroom with a toilet and a shower. There was also a single person restroom with only a toilet. We were given all toiletries that we would need. I was there for like 4 days I believe. They started me on meds. I had an adverse reaction to them and they offered to keep me for another day to monitor me but I declined. We had groups led by various people. The therapist led one, the day techs led one, students from the nearby university led one. We had to attend all groups unless you had prior permission because you weren't feeling well. Even then, you could only miss like 2 groups. I had a case worker and honestly she was kind of shitty. She literally said that she cared about her substance abuse clients more than she cared about mental health clients because they were more urgent and more important. We had crayons and markers and coloring sheets. Also puzzles. There was a bookshelf that had a really poor selection of books. There was a TV and a large DVD selection. The food wasn't great. There was always only one meal option each meal time. I was vegetarian and they weren't used to people with special dietary needs I guess. They forgot about me a couple times and then gave me a can of vegetable soup when they realized I had nothing to eat. It was November and really cold out so we weren't allowed to go outside to the patio area. I was discharged and my friend came to pick me up.

WeAllHaveBeenLied2,,,,[],,,,text,t2_d2c5gk1,"Even with regards to the uncommon/rare side effects of mania and seizure, TMS is pretty safe compared to most other forms of treatment:. If you take a new med and have headaches, you can the med immediately but the ache may go on for the rest of the day/several days.

Since TMS is using magnetic pulses, if you start having a little mania/seizure, it can be turned off and probably in &lt;20min, they'll go away.

If mania/seizure really concerns you despite the low chance, then obviously forgo TMS.

I found [this paper (6 pages)](http://mrri.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tms.pdf) about the adverse effects. It's worth a read. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, disregarding the side effects, how is it?

The chances are good that most people have a good experience with it. Some feel absolutely changed and better within 5 min, some may take 4-8 sessions until they notice, and sadly some don't respond. Most people who responded to it fall between not bad, good, very good, great, and lifesaving awesome.

My experience was overall good. By session 5 I felt...well, I just felt better. It wasn't happy better but not at least I didn't ""feel"" dead/empty. I also was less irritable, focus and energy was a bit better, and relaxed.

Most people get ""maintenance"" sessions after several months or years to maintain that but if a person responded well, it usually lasts a good amount of time. Mine's lasted 4 month

Nothing is set in stone, and to say it is is to play a trick on your own mind. I suffered from depression for a solid 5 years, and I cured it though a shit load of practice and BELIEVING IN MYSELF. I cannot stress this enough, you have to BELIEVE, and not give into the negative thoughts. We dont know shit, and to think we do will get us in trouble and also make us feel like shit.
At first, I was the same as you. But the I realized thinking like that only made my depression worse, and I wanted to get better. So I started changing around variables, doing small things differently in my everyday life and seeing what worked. 
I discovered that my breath was ways directly connected with my thoughts/feelings. So I started  with pushups. Every morning right when I woke up, instead of scrolling on my phone for 4 hours and feeling depressed, i forced my self to do stretches and do pushups. Later I added a cold shower and deep calming breathing method to my daily routine. I made more progress in one month than I did in 4 years. 
The things we think and feel are results of how we feel and act (its cyclical), and how we think and feel are results of how we feel and act. By realizing that the thoughts in my head were ultimately useless (the ones that made me depressed), and practicing new habits every day, I learned that the brain is extremely plastic if we want it to be. 
Now I am usually in a neutral state. If I feel a wave of depression I have trained myself to completely avoid it, and when I want to get something done I keep neutral and or positive in order to get neutral/positive results.

To her, it was her only point for validation. How can one go on if school doesn't work out? what next? Life seems meaningless, doesn't it?

But as time goes on, you realize that school is not as significant as it seems. Surprisingly, you do not need to do post-secondary education to have a decent living. I think this stress of feeling like you will fail as a human is making your mental illnesses seem a million times worse. 

Right now, you are going through a tunnel way of thinking. Many people who are on the verge of a mental breakdown usually feel this. After all, it feels like nothing else matters except these really big problems. Don't worry, it's completely natural that tunnel thinking is happening. I have a feeling you know this deep down as well. 

It's obvious that school is not for you, or at least not for now. You cannot complete your studies like this, and I think your parents would absolutely not want to see the negative effects of this to take over you completely. I think they mean well, but because they are not inside your head they do not feel the urgency and dread you feel right now. Even people like your therapists will not understand it, but I can promise you, they will understand your desperation in a way when you lay it out to them straight. It's hard and you'll think there is no way for them to understand, but please, tell them everything. Your parents seem to care for you, and I think they would rather have a stable enough daughter who is working out her life without post-secondary education than one who is hurting her own soul over something she cannot control, leading to her downfall and not even completing the post-secondary education.

It might hurt, especially after all the money you have spent on it, but tell them every single thing that you are thinking, feeling, and overall experiencing. Tell them your fears, and what this future is like if you continue down this path. They want a daughter who is alive, and that is the most important thing for you to focus on right now. 

Money does not matter when it comes to saving someone. Pride also does not matter when it comes to saving someone. The only thing that matters is support, and I'm sure they would want to help in that if it means to save you. 

Dying isn't happiness. You can find your happiness when you quit school. You think they won't listen? Your parents will. If not, then paramedics will. If you feel like this again, like this urgency to die, call 911. This is something that needs more attention, at least from someone who can help you. Once your parents see how dire this is, they will realize that school is not the most important thing. I also hope you can realize this as well.

No matter what it takes, take any route to better yourself. Even if it means rebelling to prove your situation.

psilocy3Ibin,,,,[],,,,text,t2_57gs06gf,"Realize this: thoughts arent even real, words are given meaning by us. The ""truth"" of basically everything other than basic math (ex 2+2=4) is unknown, as a species we literally dont know shit relatively speaking. To believe in negative things you experience is just as valid to believe the exact opposite (i.e. positive things), and when you think about it the negative only serve to hold us back and produce more negative, so it makes more sense to forget about the stuff that brings you down, and just stay neutral or use positive things to bring yourself up when you feel down.
The thoughts in your head making you feel this way isnt you, they are visitors that snuck their way into your mind through the formation of unconscious habits. Dont worry though, we were never given maps to this reality which is why mental illness is so prevalent. I am here to make more maps, along with the people who taught me. 
First off, the way you can stop these thoughts is through breath. When you feel this way notice your breath will always be shallow, short, and or quick. You must become conscious of your breath. Realize thoughts always follow your breath, as breath is everything, it connects us to this universe and this body. 
Find a meditation technique that calms you and makes you have deep slow breath, and make sure its fairly simple. If you can meditate for 30 mins every day for a week, you will see IMMENSE differences in the way you feel. You can use the technique you choose to practice anytime you start to feel anxious. Just begin the breathing technique and let go of your thoughts. Remember, with enough practice you don't even have to think internal dialogue at all, so thinking negative is absolutely unnecessary. And your mind is going to try and trick you into giving into the negative, but it wont work as long as you over power it with calm breathing and the knowledge of the truth, that being that in reality we are the seekers and the makers of truth, and that truth is infinite, and not definite, but also definite in this way. This may seem confusing, but its because language itself is confusing and is not capable of properly explaining these kinds of things. Language in this way actually is also generally what contributes to anxiety and depression, a reliance and gripping of language in a way that doesnt see the ideas that the language produces in a neutral way, (i.e. seeing language in the negative way is what fuels anxiety and depression). 
This is why I recommend forgetting about language all together, and seeing things more simple, in a cause and effect manner.
Effect your breath, which in turn will effect all other areas of your life. Because breath comes first before everything, it also effects everything. Let go, feel energy, relax, and be. Forget about internal dialogue, it is useless for you at the moment. Avoid it all together as much as possible until you bring your mind back to a balance, otherwise the  dialogue will continue to fuck with u because it is dominating your mind when you are in those states of unconscious habit. In a neutral state, dialogue can be seen from a neutral and objective place. In a negative (or even positive state) internal dialogue will be muddied up by said states, causing confusion/insurity/anxiousness/etc.  Use neutral or positive states when you are in a negative one, and once neutral simply stay neutral. It will allow you to make decisions and have thoughts that are good for you.",,,,,1577418738,,,fc4jt6y,False,t3_eg396m,,True,t3_eg396m,/r/mentalhealth/comments/eg396m/help_i_have_so_many_thoughts_in_my_head_but_i/fc4jt6y/,,1577418739,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,,,,,,False,{},,[],False,0.0,[],[],,False,,,

psilocy3Ibin,,,,[],,,,text,t2_57gs06gf,"I can relate to this, as I made my own kind of CBT through my own dealings with anxiety and depression. 
It worked for me to see it like this:
Everytime I got anxious or depressed or had a panic attack, I realized my breath (breath is the true root of our problems I found) was short, shallow, and quick. 
I already realized that internal dialogue was something that just fueled the feelings, and that I couldn't effect the anxiety directly through internal dialogue. 
So logically, I tried to effect the feeling as opposed to the thought. Instead of telling myself knowing that the thoughts in my head werent true (which they arent, negative thoughts are destructive and unnecessary, they are more like leftovers from previous evolutionary brain circuits), I would simply activate a calming breathing technique as soon as I felt an anxious spiral, depression, or panic attack coming on. By forcing myself to take deep, slow, and calm breaths, it made my body pretty much physically and mentally incapable of being suseptable to the mental illnesses. The mental illnesses could not effect me as long as my breathing was deep, slow, and calm. 
Long story short, effect the feelings first. Thoughts arent even real, and dont even really have meaning. We give them all the meaning they have. They are simply a method.of communication, and once we start to use words in our own brains it can really fuck with us if we dont have the right techniques/habits in place. Energy/vibration is the truth, and breath is what connects us and allows us to experience to this reality.
Become conscious of your breath, practice, forget internal dialogue let it go, and focus on energies. Keep it simple as possible, and make maps for your mind. Test different variables and how they effect you differently.

SpiralAsh,,,,[],,,,text,t2_54g2nsrz,"Ugh. I’m likely to project my own crap all over this, so be forewarned. What you described sounds so much like my first therapy experience it’s uncanny. 

I’m likely to ramble, just to share my own experience of navigating this, but before I say anything else...You’re 5-6 sessions in, this is the exact time to have this conversation with your therapist. It’s time to figure out if you are going to be a good match or if it’s time to move on and find someone else. Feel free to walk in and just say you’re a little unsure about the therapy process and what to expect in sessions. You may mention your appreciation and how it feels nice to be able to just talk. It’s a rare experience to get that type of individualized attention. On the other side of that, it’s important to say what you expected. For example, a little more response to what you’re saying. Do you need to hear them share some of their general impressions about what they are picking up from you? What their opinion is? Some tips on how to handle the reasons you came to therapy? If that is what you are looking for, ask for it. Prepare yourself for it generating tons of additional conversation.

The myth that therapists aren’t able to give opinions, tips, etc. is crap. Yes, they will tell them that in school. And, no, their main purpose isn’t to sit there and fire advice at you. They should be focused on navigating you through the process of deciding how to approach something in a way that will work for you. But through that navigation is actually the opportunity to provide tips. If they are in tune with you, their guidance should include helping you think through what may/may not work for you individually based off the information you’ve provided. Will they shy away from direct advice giving, yes, it’s likely. But if they are shying away from opening conversation about how to help you move forward, it’s a big red flag in my book. Unfortunately, it might come down to you to bring it up.

Another side note. Not knowing where you’re located, what type of therapist you are seeing, or how the service is getting paid for...many therapists can provide a diagnosis and actually have to. Whether or not they share them is an individual decision based on the therapist’s philosophy and the client need. Feel free to ask. Consider what makes it important to you. Do you really need a diagnosis, do you want to know? Many people feel some validation or clarity from a diagnosis. (I was nearly a year in before I blurted out the question myself for some reason, and I wasn’t really prepared for the response. Hearing the official diagnosis in one way validated it really was that bad, but on the other hand I wasn’t ready for it. Still trying to sort through what it actually means to be this person with this diagnosis. In some ways I wish I hadn’t asked.)

My first therapist sounds like yours. And I held on way too long waiting for things to change. Not going to say there was no benefit at all, but now that I’ve had another experience I realize how different therapy can feel. In a good way. I did ask my first therapist to tell me what to expect from therapy, I did state that I couldn’t take control of my session, I did state after long periods of silence that I needed them to say something. Then I waited for her approach to shift in any way and it never did. It’s not like I didn’t want to take control of my session and be able to talk around the silence (noting short periods of silence are positive!), but I was definitely not in that place. So maybe my first therapist’s approach was great for some people, but it wasn’t for me. And she showed zero capacity to shift herself to give me what I needed. Hell, the silence issue alone was enough to convince me she really was just not skilled in what I needed. It was like she would put down her gavel and wouldn’t break the silence even when I begged for her too. Funny, she was listed as a trauma-informed therapist. But she couldn’t pick up that I would be dissociating or sliding into flashbacks while she refused to break the silence? 

It has been such a relief to now be working with someone who can alter their approach to what I need. In an overall way or in a session by session way. I went in to my new therapist and within the first couple of sessions basically stated what wasn’t working for me in the previous therapy experience. And I can tell my current therapist isn’t entirely on board with everything I need, they challenge me and ask me to consider pushing myself a bit. But they don’t leave me hanging. They will shift themselves. They’ve even reached out and paid for their own consultation with specialists to help them in their own therapeutic approach so they can help me more effectively. They will guide me through advising myself, they will print off or suggest tips of things I can do that link directly to my specific needs, they will allow me to come in with absolutely nothing to say but get us somewhere that day in session. And, my gawd, they don’t allow me to entirely lose myself in silence that lasts way too long to be healthy and productive. Is it perfect? Nope. But, it’s responsive to my needs. And if I’m going to pay for a service I do expect the provider to at least be doing their very best to give me the best service they have to offer.

Ahh...told you I would ramble. You’re at the perfect time to have this conversation with you’re therapist and see how/if they are willing to shift their approach. If not, and this approach works for you, then you’ve found a good therapist. If not, and this approach doesn’t work for you, you haven’t found your good therapist. 

It’s so hard. Mustering the courage to seek therapy in the first place then having to consider finding a different one.

eaxxx,,,,[],,,,text,t2_hk75k,"You don't have a job, but want one. That's good. The only thing I can advise you is start small. Get any job that pays and work your way up. No one starts at their dream job and ALL high paying jobs comes with strings. You may have money, but you will be stressed out.

If you don't have any income, any salary or wage will do. Doesn't matter if you're mopping floors or creating fancy coffee drinks. Honest work for honest pay. Some of the most interesting jobs I've heard from people is like being a doorman or front desk person. Seriously, great low threshold job that allows you to know more and more people. Is it gonna get you the Nobel Peace Prize? No, but it's a job! I personally think being mailman isn't glamorous, but your day ends when you deliver all your mail...you don't have to take your work home with you. 😀

If you have trouble with things like getting to workplace cuz you can't drive or don't have a car, this is where you ask for help from family or friends. You're not asking to borrow money and sit around all day. You're asking for help to get to work, pay for a work uniform, etc. Eventually you WILL return the favor and help as long as you can work hard.

If you feel nervous or intimidated in the job interview, just be honest with the supervisor. Say you're willing to learn, work hard and go from there. You don't need to have super education or magnificient skills, only the motivation to be a respectful worker who wants a job.

psilocy3Ibin,,,,[],,,,text,t2_57gs06gf,"I would recommend breathing technoques/meditation. If you create a habbit of calm breath throughout the day, most of your problems will go away. That being said it is not easy, but is very possible for everybody. Your mind is tricking you through negatively reinforced mental habits that produce thoughts that only further bring you down. The negative thoughts and feelings arent you, you are an amazing wonderful lovely human. The negative things are things external to you that have snuck their way into your mind through unconscious habbit formation. 
First work on letting go, and realizing you dont deserve to feel negative. Heck, in reality we dont have to think at all. With practice we can make it so our minds are completely neutral and have no internal dialogue whatsoever. 
Work on habbits that reinforce the positive. Habits are the most important thing when it comes to lots of mental health. 
Find your bad mental habits, the things that bring you down, and believe/do the opposite!
If you feel depressed everytime you think about going to college for example, replace those thoughts with activating a breathing technique that calms you down and clears your mind. Our minds will never operate properly if there is negative feelings/thoughts dominating. The negative muddys up reality. Bring yourself up to the neutral, and there you will see the real truth. 
Breath is all, and all of our thoughts and feelings are dictated by breath. Become conscious of your breath and you will realize that if you can utilize calm deep rhythmic breath, you can overcome any negative thing. I know you can better, want it and believe in yourself! The negative things that you say that bring you down are total bullshit. Potentials are infinite, and to believe in the negative only brings more negative things closer. In reality we can believe in whatever we want, and the negative path only tricks us into getting more negative shit. Believe in good, especially when it feels the hardest, no matter what!!!

They are parts of your brain that trick you. But they are not you. They are results of an infinite amount of variables. You can and you will find the way that brings you back up. For every negative feeling you have about life there is infinite loving thoughts/feelings/energies waiting for you to ask for them. I know you dont want to feel like this. I know you feel helpless but your are not. Thoughts dont even exist, neither does language. The only thing that truly exists is energy/vibrations of this universe. Seek the love and help that you have for and within yourself. I can already tell you are a strong individual, you just got a bit lost. Start slow, get active, do some pushups every morning to show yourself you are in control of your mind and make some new habbits, forget about the ones that make you feel bad. You dont deserve to feel negative and there is ways to get rid of those feelings. The only good thing negative feelings/thoughts are good for is helping us realize that they are useless, and that they factually wrong when examined with a more true form of logic. Believe in yourself, love yourself, have hope for the positive or neutral. In reality we all know nothing (relatively speaking), so to believe in the negative is simply a trick of the mind. We have the ultimate choice. We were tricked along the way and had our maps of reality taken away by dictating forces. I know you can get better friend. Start with some meditation/breathing techniques  combined with physical activity. Make new habbits that reinforce the positive, and do your best to not attach to negative. Let go of the  negative and hold onto the positive neutral. Every  story has 2 sides, and outside of that story is the third (neutral) side. Dont give into the negative, use it to motivate you to bring yourself out of it. You dont need the.negative and dont deserve it. You can pull yourself back up. Make new habbits and stick to them, through this you will see the power of your mind. With practice of new habbits over old you will begin to understand more what I am saying, how the negative are simply tricks meant to hold us back. Dont believe in them, because we truly know nothing. Believe in something (positive or neutral) that allows you to give yourself strength, because to not do so is simply the negative tricking you through habbits in your mind that you didnt even know were there. They are a result of society and rapid technology, the negative side. But once you find the positive side the potentials of reality open themselves up to you. There is so many reasons for you to live, I promise you. Please message me jf you have any questions or if you just want to talk.

Geedish,,,,[],,,,text,t2_3gckxzep,"Hey whats up this seem like a kinda late response for this post but i thought ill put my two cents in lol

I used  struggle with  a lot of the stuff you listed here and heres what helped me

1)  Honestly the best thing in my opinion for self sabotage it to meditate in the morning and the night its a great way to clear your mind and reflect on the actions you took that way. Try to close your eyes think about what your sabotaging in your life ponder on that thought for and then begin to breath in and out you'll notice that you'll begin to feel relaxed and start to think clearly about it. Clear your mind and begin to think about what you want to achieve in your life and try to catch your self sabotage. think about the actions your going to take and think about if they are going to help you

2) If your feeling mentally at your worst try to tell your self something positive about yourself every night before you go to sleep. Try to focus on positive things about yourself and your life look back on your life and tell yourself you'll be fine.  Try not to say "" Im gonna fuck up anyway/everyone already knows this""  cause your all your doing is telling yourself your gonna fail. Try to encourage your self and be your own hype man and say your not gonna fuck up and I believe in me. I found this to be a great way to  positive mind and limit self sabotage

3) try to reflect on your day take a look at all the positives and negatives in your day and reward your self for looking at the positive things that happened in your life and sit back and take a rational look at the negatives in your day. Try not to get sadden by the negatives in day to day life but to look at them rationally and work out your problems. Also try not to let the negatives in your daily life consume your entire day. If something has happened that makes your day worse try to limit how long you think negatively on it. Try to cat yourself thinking these negative thought and  tell yourself that even though this bad thing happened you can make the rest of the day better.

4) Dont worry about fucking up with medicine every one is unsure about there goal and futures in life and it also always fine to find your passion later on in life it just takes exploration and time to find it. Dont fear failure but look at it as as another avenue for success in your life, its not always a bad thing failure may close one opportunity for you but many more  and exciting opportunities will come up. and dont say its your fault for feeling this way. Its a natural for some people to feel like this and you shouldn't blame yourself for your sadness.  Look at it as a chance to make yourself a better person and a better life. 

Sorry if this was a little long but I hope what i wrote is able to help you out in any way and if you need any more advice my dms are always open.

Hydn7822,,,,[],,,,text,t2_es8gz1e,"&gt;That is where you are leaping to. In other words, taking a chance. Perhaps you could write her a letter, sit down and have her read it to herself. I recommended this to a friend years ago. He sat down with her at the kitchen table, she read it and then wept.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;It is sometimes difficult to express feelings, of course. I would say it is because what we feel is irrational, but when we speak what we feel we leave ourselves vulnerable, and nobody wants to  feel vulnerable. We want to feel safe, comforted, accepted.  Sometimes, tho, we have to say ""fuck it"", and just take a chance. The alternative is we get worse, over time we ave a mental breakdown. I have had 3 mental breakdowns, they locked me up 3 times. All that could have been avoided had I realized that I was not as weak as family told me I was. After all, who is the weak one, the person who hides how they feel or one who stands up to those bad thoughts and says ""Nah, bruh"". If none will stand with you, you must stand for yourself. That is how growth happens. Thats how you become who you are.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;After all you have said, even with the doubt, it does seem you have somewhat of a handle on it. The issue is, finding the way in which to get out what you feel, so another can empathize.

FastDatabase3,,,,[],,,,text,t2_53pqwiuh,"\&gt; Being late makes me anxious.

Also a symptom. Basically not having smooth sailing in daily time management.

Having an anxiety complex about time management and organization, and/or overcompensating time management and organization.  Weaponizing anxiety is one of the most common tactics, just as it's common to find yourself unable to get something done if there isn't a fire under your ass and you can't quite get a fire going. You'll have an exponential productivity curve leading up to deadlines even with lots of self-management. The most common problem is just taking longer than other people to get the same amount of productivity done, which is pretty vague. ADHD is one of those things everyone claims to have.

If you \*did\* have ADHD, people in your family have it. It's one of the most genetically inheritable psychiatric problems known. You'd have had issues in childhood with stuff like procrastination and self-regulation, but problems with discipline, anger, and school grades don't always occur. It's difficult to spot in women, since men tend to have the more visible symptoms. Men tend to have irritability, bad grades, addictions, etc, women get described as ""*bubbly*"" with vague suspicions of weak bipolarism or related.

Dunno. But you'll find people with ADHD can subconsciously spot each other. It's in everything from speech patterns to body language, it's not easy to spot unless you're familiar with it.

Also, *Anxiety* and *Depressive Episodes* are comorbid. So is *Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria*. Sometimes *Sensory Processing Disorder*. Sometimes *Body Focused Repetitive Behaviors*. If you're paranoid about ADHD, you might read into them.",,,,,1584674458,,,fkzmdip,False,t3_fl1jem,,True,t1_fky0vp1,/r/mentalhealth/comments/fl1jem/my_coworkers_think_im_annoying/fkzmdip/,,1584678470,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,,1584674825.0,,,,False,{},,[],False,0.0,[],,,False,,,

You have every right to be sad and disappointed. And it sucks that there is literally nothing any can do about this, we just have to accept it. Blame can't be put on anyone as this is literally for everyone's safety.

Almost everyone in this world is being affected by this, and all we can do is wait for the day where we can look back and just talk about how insane of a time this is and how we all made it through.

If it dies down by the time graduation comes around, take your friends and just travel. Make the most out of what could have been. Make your own memories and you will come out on top of this.

**Relaxation techniques----** (I prefer # 2 &amp; 3; it does take practise, one or two times won't do much)----

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations. Breath focus can be especially helpful for people with eating disorders to help them focus on their bodies in a more positive way. However, this technique may not be appropriate for those with health problems that make breathing difficult, such as respiratory ailments or heart failure.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there. A body scan can help boost your awareness of the mind-body connection. If you have had a recent surgery that affects your body image or other difficulties with body image, this technique may be less helpful for you.

3. **Guided imagery**. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes—just make sure to choose imagery you find soothing and that has personal significance. Guided imagery may help you reinforce a positive vision of yourself, but it can be difficult for those who have intrusive thoughts or find it hard to conjure up mental images.
4. **Mindfulness meditation**. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future. This form of meditation has enjoyed increasing popularity in recent years. Research suggests it may be helpful for people with anxiety, depression, and pain.

Hi Everyone,

This is a difficult time for many people, whether they have mental health issues or not. I've noticed several people posting and asking about how to deal with the isolation/lack of being able to socialize during this time. If you are also dealing with depression, keeping yourself isolated can be even harder, no matter where you are in your recovery process. So here are a few ideas to help you through the tough times, and hopefully help you deal with isolation.

Something to consider is limiting your exposure of listening to info about the virus to a few minutes a day, so that you can keep up with the newest information, but not overwhelm yourself. If you are isolated with family/friends/roommates and they are constantly watching/reading/listening about it, and it starts to overwhelm you, walk out of the room or ask them to please not discuss it in front of you. Do what you can to stay informed, but not over loaded.

Keep (or start) a routine of some kind, even if it has to be amended due to closures and cancellations. Get up at the same time, eat at the same time, schedule activities for yourself, go to bed at the same time, etc. Schedules can help reduce stress, help us keep our focus, spread our activities over each day, so that we aren't over loaded one day, and under scheduled another day, and helps us stay organized.

Do your best to stay in contact with people, even if it has to be over the phone, or text, or face time. Do more posting on different subs on Reddit and see if there are some people you can connect to, you might make a new friend or two through that. As I mentioned, I have been seeing others post about this concern about the isolation related to the virus, so have a scroll through the other posts, and comment to some one else who is in the same boat, saying 'hi', chat and see if you have something in common, or like the same sport, or music, or books, or some small connection, and then keep in touch and/or 'chat' with the others on this sub. Maybe people can all make some new online friends that need some socialization to feel a bit better during this tough time. I get it is different than real life, but it's at least a little way you could try and get some socialization.

If you are a sports fan and your sport has been cancelled, (Example: for me, the NHL was a huge distraction. I'm still getting a little bit of hockey, as they have been airing some 'classic' games). Maybe you could check out your area for any re-runs of games, or even go to YouTube and watch old videos of games, bloopers, best plays, etc.

Open your curtains so you can at least see outside, and let some sun in/natural lighting; it can also give an illusion the room/space is bigger than it really is, hopefully lessening the sense of feeling boxed in.

books (read an old favourite, or find something you normally wouldn't read, to see if you can find something new to enjoy)

craft type kits (maybe start a new hobby that isn't too expensive)

exercise (dancing, stretching, skipping, anything that moves your body)

listen to music/songs/sounds you like eg: water sounds/thunder &amp; lightening storms/whale sounds/etc

talk/phone/text a friend/face time/post online

write a letter to someone

smell some flowers

take a bath/shower with your favourite soaps/bubble bath

if you are in an apartment with a balcony, (away from others), spend a bit of time on the balcony getting some fresh air, read a book, or magazine, or just sit and watch the clouds or do some deep breathing

\*\*\*\*\*---go for a walk outside only ***IF*** your area is allowing that; practise social distancing and go to a more isolated area if possible; if it is not allowed where you live, follow the appropriate rules.

read other stories on Reddit (check out some other subs you don't usually read)

Have you ever been curious about a topic, but never had time to research it; do it now, Google is your friend!

Look up a beginners online course for a language you've always been curious about; learn a few phrases

if you are in an apartment with a balcony, (away from others), spend a bit of time on the balcony getting some fresh air, read a book, or magazine, or just sit and watch the clouds or do some deep breathing

\*\*\*\*\*---go for a walk outside only ***IF*** your area is allowing that; practise social distancing and go to a more isolated area if possible; if it is not allowed where you live, follow the appropriate rules.

\- There is also another Reddit sub that has a lot of good information, maybe check it out for further suggestions. It's called [r/SelfCareCharts](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfCareCharts/)

*this* is the reason why people are supposed to stay home and quarantine and all, to spread the time of infection, so that when people get sick, they can get treatment. If everyone‘s sick at the same time the hospitals won‘t have enough beds, but if we act responsibly we can lessen that problem.

Wash your hands, keep distance to other people, clean public things like idk payphones before use, don‘t travel, etc

Also the mortality rate is 0.1 so your son‘s chances of survival are up at 99.9%  seeing as that number is calculated with the number of *confirmed* cases. Most cases go unnoticed and without testing, so this would already be the mortality rate on the group of people most affected. So logically the chance of him surviving are exponentially higher than it costing his life

I know deep down that I should, but I dont really know what to say to them. 

I think it's unlikely that I'm depressed because I dont have major depressive periods. I've looked into the symptoms of depression and the stories of those suffering from it, but I cant relate to alot of them. For example, I have never been in bed for days at a time simply because I didnt have the energy/motivation to get up. 

I'm also scared to say that I want to die for fear of them being obliged to tell my parents if they believe I am in danger of hurting myself. I have self-harmed in the past, but this was because of a stressful event at the time, and not related to my current situation. 

Ultimately, I dont know what to say to my GP as well as not wanting to waste their time.

YES to therapy. All of it. And not just the stuff that gives you tools on how to manage your depression, but the deep, deep childhood Jungian stuff. If I didn’t learn why I was how I was, and then go through this year of anger and sadness, and then take the necessary steps to change what I needed to change, I would never get out of the pit. Good therapy is swimming through the river of sh*t so you can get to the dry bank on the other side.

YES to medication. It’s a booster, it won’t change everything. You might have more luck with mood stabilizers instead of anti-depressants. And, we are currently in an anti-depressant epidemic, so that always felt a little more comfortable for me. But that is just ego, don’t let it get to you.

YES to regimented sleep. I mean this. You know the word lunacy or lunatic? It comes from luna, the moon. And it’s because during full moons when we didn’t have fully dark homes would keep people up, and it would trigger mania in bipolar. If I sleep 5 hours, I’m a wreck. If I sleep 9 hours, I’m a wreck. I need 7-8 like clockwork, and it seriously takes me from a 2/10 to a 7/10. Do whatever you can to manage this: yellow light glasses, sleeping medication (stay away from benzo/opioids), job changes, anything. The studies on this keep on coming. 

YES to exercise. It works, it works, it works. Don’t do sh*t you hate: if you hate running, lift. If you hate lifting, do yoga. Do it, celebrate every workout, breathe in the endorphin freedom. You can start with literally one exercise and grow from there.

YES to finding self responsibility. You will never heal without it. I recently talked to a woman with a 35-year-old bipolar son living back at home. I told her, “Sorry mom. I know you want to love him, and I know he is in pain, but he will never heal if he is still under mom’s roof.” It’s just how male psychology works. I know you are female, but there are equivalents to this; such as you saying losing your partner would be the end of it. I am absolutely in LOVE with my current partner. I feel the same way. But technically, I do not NEED her. She doesn’t feed me, or pay my bills, or organize my hiking trips (now if I didn’t have those, that’s another story…). So you must find self-reliance. You can, and you will.

YES to long term goals and short term habits. This is called Kaizen. Your small victories are not working because they aren’t going anywhere. I know we are told to celebrate the showers and the little stuff, and sometimes that helps, but you need to celebrate the showers because that means you are one step closer to X. Being self-reliant. Volunteering for a cause. Travelling. Getting in great shape. Start with your values, create a self-mission statement, set five year goals, and break those all the way down to literally what you have to do TODAY to reach it. Write one sentence of a book. Do one pushup. Now these things have meaning.

YES to sobriety. I don’t drink or smoke and I’m very bored and it sucks. But I am stable. And I don’t have breakdowns. And I don’t have binges. And it is so, so much better. You’ll find a whole new world of health and friendships to explore.

Do not flail your fists violently at depression. It is a fog, it cannot be beat that way. You must be calm, collected, slow and steady. You must wake up to good music, cook a good breakfast, get out the door. Get out the door, every single day. Go to a coffee shop and read, whatever.

You must confront your ineffective thoughts with questions. Not “I’m NOT a terrible person!” but, “OK, sure brain, I’m a terrible person. Here, I’m going to get up right now and knock this person’s coffee out of their hand because I’m terrible. Wait, of course I’m not going to do that. Can I really be that Bad? Hm...”

YES to trusting others. Everything I just said above, depression has given you reasons and excuses why it will not work. I’ve been there. “That’s all great, but…” You are in the fog so you can’t SEE. We can see you, though. I can see you be happy, healthy, stable, strong. I can see you get down like we all do, but knowing how to manage it correctly and knowing it will end. Be well, I am here.

Get help, make a change for yourself, but don't blame this on a skin color issue when clearly you're just being ignorant. Sorry. And acting like you have autism is not a thing. It's a condition, and has nothing to do with having no respect and not doing any work or any of the other things you mentioned. 

I would genuinely try to help you in more detail if you didn't compare your behavior to crazy people, autistic people, or white people. Act like the best version of yourself, not like your race or an illness you're not diagnosed for (that's not a thing!!).",True,,,0.0,1530222924,,0.0,e1gqlu5,False,t3_8ukvhb,1.0,True,t3_8ukvhb,/r/mentalhealth/comments/8ukvhb/i_act_like_i_am_white/e1gqlu5/,20480.0,1533039779,2,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,public,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,richtext,

illuminatcd,1526929438.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_1eb5fnya,"Insomnia is the worst freaking thing, I hear you. My insomnia has been getting worse and worse as well. I'm sorry. I am taking a few different medications to help me sleep - mirtazepine had helped me tremendously in falling asleep within a few minutes and I know it's helped a few others as well, but its effect wore off (my psychiatrist at the time resigned and my other ones haven't been that interested in upping the dosage every now and then as they should). Since you said you can't visit a professional though, I'll focus on some other things. There are over-the-counter sleeping medications available, which are not as strong and for me only helped if taken in higher doses (still recommend, obviously make sure not to go over the limit). You could look into this if you haven't already and if you have the option.

I went to a sleeping clinic a while ago that would've been incredibly helpful if I sticked to the idea and didn't let my depression take over, but I truly believe it might help others as well. The principle of it can be done without seeing anyone (I know I've done the process on my own before). I had to stay awake for long bouts and had to do so in the living room, so 20-40 hours. I had to go to sleep at different times each night/day (9am the first night, 10am the second night, 11am the third, and so on, starting with the time I ""usually"" go to sleep and going all the way to the time that is ideal, so 10-11pm) and wake up after only a few hours of sleep. It helped reverse my schedule again, but eventually it ""wore off"" as I started feeling worse and worse mentally. The main idea is to have the bed serve specifically for sleeping, and to stay active during the day. Which was difficult, but helpful.

Meditation can help temporarily for some people both for sleeping issues and stress. It's a slow solution and not guaranteed at all, but definitely worth a try. Forcing a pattern in your day (eating meals at the ""normal"" times even if you're not up or haven't slept in a while can help, so can going outside at the same time each day, or exercising at the same time, showering in the morning, etc. etc.) can trick your sleeping habits into forming around those habits too.

The next thing that has helped me a little bit in the past is good ol' sunlight. Get sunlight in the morning and a little throughout the day, and turn all the lights (as well as media) off when it's night. It does sound very much like your insomnia is connected to your depression/anxiety, and I personally believe the secondary problem can't be fixed entirely if the cause remains the same (which, tbh, is advice I should probably take myself). I can't help a lot with this as I don't know your exact situation, but I definitely encourage looking into personal solutions and cutting some stressful habits out of your life if you can (this includes stressful people).

I think, sometimes, cyclical cultural things like this can be hard because it’s as though we’ve been conscripted into something that doesn’t make a good deal of abstract sense and that is seemingly unprompted by anything within our lives.  It seems out of the blue, and irrational, and weird.

Think of Holi Day in India, for example, where spontaneously, for no apparent reason, you can’t walk down the street without people throwing colored powder at you.  To someone who isn’t exactly on the same page with the whole business it’s got to be jarring and overwhelming.

I think when people have a hard time getting through the day to day of things, when we have to work so hard to orient ourselves to the world, it’s difficult when the world starts behaving irrationally, and especially when everyone in it plays along out of some seemingly universal sense of tradition.  It’s as though everyone else “gets” these things, and has gone cuckoo over it in a way that we don’t feel a part of because for us the day to day of life is a lot more taxing and serious.  Sometimes, people like us just don’t have the extra patience and resources to indulge that kind of silliness.

When it’s something as gargantuanly overblown as Christmas in the Western world, to which we devote a solid three months now (an absurd exaggeration driven by “market forces”), it can really get psychologically disturbing.  You have to remember that this started out as something Central and Northern Europeans did to pass the time in the coldest and most boring time of the year.  But now, when every place you go takes for granted that it’s appropriate to play Bing Crosby on repeat for weeks on end, it just contributes to the feeling that the whole business is some metastasized nonsense running on its own power, to which we are all subject and that kind of thing has its own bizarre tyranny.

Here is the truth. We have very little control over what happens around us.  I used to get really angry because I would work my ass off in school or at work, and it never made me happy. My happiness was always something outside of myself that I needed to acquire. The promise of power and perfection is like that. It will never be enough for you. It is like a drug. A drug that will destroy you if you let it.

When we hold a belief that we deep down know to be untrue, we suffer. This is called cognitive dissonance. Buddhists call it Dukka. 

Personally, I am willing to bet that your feelings of perfectionism come from insecurities and fear because that is where mine came from. I felt that I would feel 'secure' if I demanded perfection from myself. Insecurity is a normal emotion, especially as a young man. Here is the deal though. You won't grow and actually work toward creating the best version of yourself if you can't acknowledge those feelings. Pretending they don't exist is making you miserable.

This is the type of thing that you'll have to get ahead of, or the consequences could be very serious for you, or others.  I don't want to make you feel pushed away, or judged, but these types of thoughts merit some urgent attention.  

So, when you're feeling calm enough to take it on, you need to sit down and go over your options for help.  It's important you do this while you're lucid and able to handle it.  If you wait until you red line, it's going to be too late to do anything useful about it.  Be willing to give yourself breaks if you find it overwhelming. 

I don't know what is available where you are, but there are always websites, community health lines, clinics at hospitals, drop-in centres, etc. to check.  By no means are they going to fix things immediately.  You may not have much that you can access.  But, you need to make a point of contact for a start.

- sititng under a warm shower (not to hurt yourself, but the water can work calming and it brings you back into your body)

You have to find something that gets you out of your head, into your body. I personally like to sit under a warm shower and feel the water hitting my body. 

If it's caused by heavy emotions, you need to find a way to deal with them, scream, go for a run, put on rly loud music and dance.. journal,read a book. It can also help if you can trigger yourself to deal with the emotions. For me a lot of times, I realize that there is sadness behind wanting to hurt myself and it can help me to hear movie music, it triggers me to cry and after I feel that the emotion isn't so bad anymore.

In my case though I am struggling with the realisation that I pretty much want someone to put themselves out of my misery. I’ve spoken to my mother a few times over the past few days and she seems more stable but the underlying issue is not going to go away any time soon. It’s going to be a very long very drawn out process because it seems basically my parents are determined to act like children and keep things going for perhaps years so they can get their hits on each other in. Fuck them for that, especially given what this has been doing to myself and my sister. The idea of my mother’s suicide, as ghastly as it is, that puts a full stop on it. I’d grieve, I’d miss her, I’d always wonder what might have been - but I will be able to move on with life. And that’s what I desperately want to do.

Go to your GP and tell them everything you just said, they can refer to you mental health services. Or if you have a named CPN contact them.

You're also correct in that people that aren't aware of their sense of self can contradict themselves, and that happens often regardless of background and family of origin. Within a therapeutic setting, there is much processing to go with the why (and also, as you mentioned, the who - which people's reactions have been the basis of what is/isn't already there, and all of the pieces that go with that), before determining the go-forward and action steps of what then happens to develop from there.

[deleted],,,,,,,,,,"If you’re talking about written exercises, someone with an unstable sense of self might theoretically answer the same values activity in contradictory ways, purely depending on their context or mentality at the time.

Sense of self is also reinforced in large part through the reactions of others. Adolescents aren’t filling out checklists, they are experimenting with different modes of behaviour and getting reinforcement based off the reactions of their peers. They’re also living in a storm of emotion which helps define who you are without question, if you accept what you feel is legitimate and acceptable. I can see how a “reminder” might help someone who lost their sense of self. But it’s not going to help someone who never developed it in the first place.

The relationship between the therapist and client might ironically help build that sense of self in itself, with the treatment being tertiary. Which is really interesting to think about. Hmm.

I agree it's good that there are place people can go when they feel suicidal, and I'm glad you were able to find a resource in inpatient therapy. Thanks for sharing your video.

My own inpatient experience (only 7 days long) was not as benficial to me... the facility showed a very high degree of neglect for patients (blood and feces on the walls, patients regularly verbally or physically abusing one another), and grossly overcharged ($8,000+ a day) and overmedicated us. A number of people have reached out to me and reported similar instances of institutional abuse, and [an NPR exclusive this week reported similar findings in patients with intellectual disabilities](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/10/566608390/she-can-t-tell-us-what-s-wrong).

For adults, one of the best resources for impulse control is practicing mindfulness. Because this is Reddit and I can be honest, mindfulness used to make my eyes roll pretty hard, because I'm naturally a skeptic, and meditation was all the way on the other side of what I was comfortable with. 

The truth is that some people are naturally comfortable practicing these techniques, and others (like me!) need a lot of practice for them to work, because they feel so uncomfortable at first. I have always been in the second camp - but I've seen these techniques be really helpful over time (for both myself and clients). The key is committing to it and then just practicing them until they feel second nature.

Because of your suicidal history, I'd definitely like to throw out the idea that getting into therapy and getting some support to lift you out of any ""collapse"" that you are feeling. 

I think right now it's important to focus on building back some strength in your identity. You don't necessarily have to leave your relationship to do identity work - if your relationship is otherwise healthy (ie. your boyfriend is supportive, kind, and you feel safe being honest with him about what you are going through), you could choose to share with him that you are struggling with feeling confident and strong in your identity, self-worth, etc and try to work on it and then see where that ends up. You did mention being ashamed to tell him the truth about something - I'd also say to you that if you have a partner you can't be honest with, then it's worth weighing whether or not they are truly a good partner for you.

A little bit of encouragement - mental health history aside, what you're experiencing is fairly common. A lot of times in new relationships, people get excited because they enjoy the person and the newness of their relationship and build up their world around the relationship, putting aside themselves (for lots of reasons).

brookewilliamslpc,,,,,,,,,,"Thanks for your question! First of all, mental health struggles are hard enough, and everything in me wants to jump up and down and tell you to speak out and get support! Even if it's not your parents, dealing with any kind of mental health issues on your own, without any support, is making it harder than it has to be. Some mental health struggles thrive in isolation. For example, if you are struggling with depression and/or anxiety, isolation helps to reinforce some of the negative messaging that comes with those disorders. Telling yourself ""I have no friends"" can be confirmed if you have no one to help you correct those messages, if that makes sense.

To answer your question, though - there are free resources available to you. The suicide hotline, if you are feeling suicidal, can help and is a free resource. My state, SC, and many others, has a hotline (211) that connects to a nonprofit or state agency that will help you with resources that can help your specific situation.

One last thing - I'm making an assumption that you're still living at home with your parents, and maybe are still in school? If you're still in school, reach out to a guidance counselor or school counselor and see what they may be able to do for you. I'm not a school counselor, so I'm not sure what their rules for confidentiality are, but if you ask them before you confide in them, they will tell you what/if they would be required to inform your parents.

When you build evidence that the negative consequence does not occur, it reduces the anxiety that leads to the compulsions.

I told him in confidence; because there are days I can't bring myself to feel anything else and when you live with someone, you see them every single day, and they notice things like that.

The best suggestion I have? Sit down and talk with her about it. Ask her how she's doing. Ask her if she has any idea why she feels that way, if there's anything that causes it specifically, if it's maybe the season or stress or something new that recently came up. Just talk about it, make her comfortable.

There the staff tried to take off the meds I've been taking for over two years for PTSD symptoms, prescribed over a dozen new brand name drugs (I have a list), attempted to switch my insurance provider away from the one who is paying for my existing care in VT to NY Medicaid which would cover their ridiculous detainment practices; the staff allowed unstable patients to freely roam and threaten other inpatients (""faggot,"" physical threats), neglected to clean up blood and shit that lay about in shared ward spaces for hours, didn't let us go outside but for one hour a day on an third-floor concrete patio surrounded by 20' of wire fence, and numerous other offenses which gradually exposed and retraumatized my history of professional mismedication and emotional abuse.

I was discharged after a week because I was denied NY Medicaid, which this hospital seems to have a financial incentive to drain, by overprescribing brand name drugs while systemically putting their patients through chemical abuse and exposing them to physical harm and retraumatization. I saw numerous patients who were entirely stable and ready for discharge who had been held for weeks, their discharge date delayed many times while they lived in prison-like conditions, at the profit of drug companies and to the detriment of patients' mental health.

I wouldn't say any of my therapists were strict adherents of any therapeutic approach and just took what they felt would be helpful from the various types.  I did a good bit of CBT workbook type stuff myself during the time, however I found it to be a poor approach to some of the more core and distressing thoughts and experiences, because CBT doesn't really address what to do when you go out and test the distorted thoughts and see it repeatedly shown as ""true"". 

After a  quick look through the materials you linked for ACT, that was a fairly heavy emphasis of a couple of my therapists, especially in terms of actions to take.

Fairly well established in literature that consciously cultivating feelings of happiness makes usore aware when experienced in our day to day life.  If you want more about it you can Google or look at the book Hardwiring Happiness by Rick Hanson.

Adding a bit of why that works, but it goes to neuro plasticity and that ""neurons that fire together wire together"".  The more you do something, the better your brain gets at it because it will rewire itself and strengthen connections between neurons as a certain pathway is used more and more.  What you are doing is trying to develop a pathway for seeing and recognizing happiness that is as strong as it is for recognizing when things are wrong, or not as good as they could be.  Part of happiness is just being aware of good things in our life that we have and experience but most of us while we tend to intellectually acknowledge that say taking a warm shower is nice, we don't really feel or experience the emotion while we have a nice shower (and as someone who lost water due a burst pipe for over 24 hours you miss it quickly when it's gone). 

I know it sounds fluffy as hell, and as a guy in my 30s it strikes me as something that couldn't possibly work, but even doing it less formally has helped some.  Tim Ferris in his podcast has talked about both the five minute journal (a gratitude journal you can buy though not needed) and a gratitude jar (so put good things that happen or things you are grateful for in a jar).  He also finds it cheesy as all get out, but quite helpful.

brookewilliamslpc,,,,,,,,,,"I think I said this in another thread earlier - but I've found that when people tell me that therapy hasn't worked for them, it's been a mismatch of therapist. Finding a therapist can be a process, and it should be treated as an interview at first. But also, this is a service that you are paying for, so if there are things that you'd like from your therapist (as an example, I have had clients that don't appreciate notes being written during session because they feel like the therapist is distracted when that is happening) then try talking through it with them directly, instead of just ignoring it, so that they can adjust to serve you the best - or if not, they can work through those specific things with you.

Additionally, taking steps to build a support system can go a long way. Thinking through what is attainable and what that may look like could help. Building relationships is hard, and can come slowly, especially when we have been burned in the past, but it can make a huge difference in how you feel about yourself.

KidneyBloodstones,1470113911.0,,,,,,,,t2_101n4j,"Hi! This is for my brother. I'll try to make this as concise as possible. Sorry in advance for the lack of formatting. 

Our mom passed away about five years back (he's now in late twenties) and it greatly affected my brother emotionally, of course. He's seemed okay up until about two years ago. He's still living at home and his bedroom had become a pit of despair. Clothes everywhere, notes scrawled on various sheets of paper (who's a real friend, who's not, different life thoughts, etc.), books all over the place.. he seemed depressed, and to add to that, kept losing multiple jobs. He wouldn't open up about much and we struggled to help him.

Eventually, he would start taking off and not coming home until the next day, usually covered in filth. Also wouldn't open up about that. Soon, here didn't come home, and we got a search party to look for him. We found his car eventually, but he wasn't in it. A few hours later, I got a call from an unknown number; he borrowed someone's phone to call and say he's safe and where he's at. We rush to pick him up (its late at night now, about eight hours later). He had bought a dog to keep himself company, but he didn't have the money to do so. He was officially mentally broken and you could see it in his eyes. A few of us stayed the night after we brought him home. He slept a bit, but when he woke up, we heard loud thumping from where we were. We rushed in and he was punching himself hard in the forehead saying how stupid he was.

We eventually calmed him down and got him to the hospital, where he was getting taken for an evaluation, but he made a scene and was strapped down and taken to a mental health facility. They put him on lithium and another medicine I can't remember at the moment. He had to stay there for a week minimum.

After he had done his ""time,"" he seemed to normalize a lot, and was instructed to keep taking the drugs and actually seek therapy. He did for a time, seemed normal, but never like his old self. A year later, he stopped taking his meds because he was feeling better - as many do. He made excuses to not be able to go to therapy, and was proud he was holding down his job like a champ. We kept bugging him to take his meds but he'd lie and say he took them. 

Now, we're starting to see the same signs. He's getting messy in his room, having nervous ticks, making weird mistakes like blackening oatmeal when he's standing right next to it, and not making a lot of sense when he's talking. We're unsure of how to approach this now. He's in denial and says he's fine, so what can we do to help him? What *should* we do? The upside to him keeping his job too is that he now has insurance, which was not a luxury before. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

After that my whole world has collapsed.

His response: It is very difficult to even get him to talk about these situations or acknowledge that they have happened. It usually comes down to one of the following responses, ""I'm fine, I was just feeling nervous, I would feel better if you were nicer to me,"" or ""Do you think I'm going crazy?"" He'll say that he thinks himself into a nervous wreck. 

He wouldn't argue that he gets defensive and I also can't say that I handle ever situation as well as I would like. I often end up getting upset or angry out of frustration of having my words mixed up or being ignored completely. There have been only a few changes. I cook really healthy food, but I can't get him to eat regularly. He says he's just not usually hungry. Before he started medication, he struggled to lose weight. He is 5'8"" and hit 230lb, which he could not lose. Then he started Wellbutrin and went up to a slightly higher dose not long after. Then he lost quite a bit of weight fairly quickly. I think he weighs closer to 185lbs now. He felt good about this but there are still episodes of this recurring anxiety, nearly 4 - 5 nights a week. 

Therapist: Our therapist is quick to mention that he cannot comment on medication. My husband and I are also not in sessions together all that often. With our work schedules we've mostly been going independently, and often my husband will stop making appointments until I remind him. Our therapist recommends that we speak to our physician and, other than that, he focuses on self care and behavioral therapy. When I'm not there, honestly, I don't think my husband tends to bring it up. 

Physician: We have a wonderful physician. She is an Internest and both my husband and I trust and value her opinion. However, I wrote a description of my husband's behavior down for his last visit with her; I know he showed it to her. She was more concerned with his past drinking habits and how they may have affected his body's chemistry. I was skeptical, but he stopped drinking for a while, his numbers got better (something specific to do with liver enzymes), and things seemed to improve for a while. But they didn't stay that way. 

I think he has still cut down on drinking, but it's possible that he's hiding it from me. I work long hours and he has done it before. But these bouts seem to be independent of alcohol, but alcohol can make them much worse. 

I have begun to write more things down. Honestly, I think living in a low level constant state of stress (and sometimes very volatile and high levels of stress) have affected my memory. I can't always remember all of the details, or sometimes why they even started, if they are more than a few days old. We've been getting into terrible fights almost every weekend for the past 12 months. 

I appreciate what you're saying. I have started to think more clearly about taking care of myself. I have had to let go a lot of control which I recognize is healthy, but it mostly just makes me sad. Somewhere inside of me feels like as long as I'm angry, I believe that there is something worth fighting for. I'm really not sure what else to do besides leave my whole life behind that we've built together.

He actually is in two grief groups. My concern is that he needs to figure out more than just losing his wife, but how to deal with my husband and I. Our relationship is getting extremely strained because he wants so much from us, and we just can't meet his emotional needs. 

I spoke with my husband again. Your insight was helpful that perhaps he really is seeing someone who limits time to just 30-40 minutes. We're going to see if we can get him to see a full-session weekly therapist that will help him with the full scope of his mental health needs rather than focusing solely on his grief. 

He needs to learn how to live an independent life. We can't keep visiting him every single day and planning weekend outings every single weekend just to entertain him.

DrKevinHyde,,,,,,,,,,"As a parent, there's nothing worse than feeling like you're screwing up your kids. It's not a feeling I would wish upon anyone and I'm sorry that you feel that way daily. I see this a lot with the patients i work with, but the path forward is different for everybody. I do think you might benefit from speaking with a therapist to get individualized advice. If you're more of a self-help person, check out The Happiness Trap by Russ Harris. He has a very approachable way of helping you to recognize when unhelpful thoughts (e.g., I'm ruining my kids, I'm failing every single day) are hooking you and taking control. Once you recognize the thoughts, you can choose whether or not to believe them. Of course I have so many questions for you, but this isn't an appropriate forum for them. So, some quick action items to consider.

1) A gratitude journal (https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_keeping_a_gratitude_journal) each evening to help you recognize that there are good things happening in your life.
2) Identify your self care needs. You're important! We often stop doing things for ourselves because we put our kids first... but on the plane they always tell us to put our own oxygen masks on first before assisting others. What are some things you enjoy that you've stopped doing? Schedule some of those things for yourself (literally, put them in your calendar, with reminders!)
3) Social supports. Social support with friends or family members is really important. Make sure you're getting enough time to talk or be with those people who you enjoy.

brookewilliamslpc,,,,,,,,,,"Hi Eliwick, first of all, thanks for your question. I can read in the tone of your message how difficult and frustrating these recent years have been, as well as your concern for the safety of your husband. From my perspective as a therapist, I'd be interested in how he perceives these ""episodes"" as you call them. Does he remember them? How does he describe them? How does he feel about them after the fact? I know that you said he's been on Wellbutrin, but I'd be really interested in if there has been a change to his dosage or any other medications that he may be on, as well as any other physical changes that he may have had. Has he had a recent physical, or check-up to rule out any other physical issues?You are his most powerful advocate in this situation because you see these episodes, and because you've known him for so long and can recognize this behavior as out of the norm for him. So even though it's a struggle to describe it, you should make sure that they understand the severity of the difference from those episodes and his normal bouts with anxiety. 

I also want to acknowledge that it is super tough to be in a relationship with someone struggling with severe mental health, and I'm sure that has taken a toll not only on your marriage, but on you!

Ark-i5,1466350521.0,,,,,,,,t2_yux85,"There was improvement at first as originally I only had the normal depression and mood swings which is the norm for an MDMA comedown and after about two weeks it was completely gone until randomly only a couple of days after it finished the mood swings started again (although to a lesser extent) before ending in a week but leaving me with that daylight association that would cause me to feel anxious and depressed. Over time the daylight association lessened but it was still quite prominent, however, everything took a turn for the worse after I had a completely random panic attack, during which I was thinking about this girl which then caused me to associate her and girls I was interested in, in general with anxiety. After this panic attack I was seriously depressed for about a week but then randomly that disappeared too, however it then seemed that after my mind learned it could associate things so easily, it then started going on a bit of a rampage with constant intrusive thoughts that I would make more associations, which it ended up doing with the stories about myself I make up in my head to pass the time. 

I might be able to find a specialist but my parents are very against me attempting different types of methods to solve the problem as they seriously misunderstand the problem and treat it as if it's just depression or anxiety and take it as a personal insult when I suggest even just going to my GP because the only help they've suggested is ignoring these negative thoughts. My therapist has suggested trying my best to think positively but also going to see my GP to explain everything and to see what they think it could be. I personally think medication might be good as it could potentially put me in a more positive mindset and therefore make me more able to overcome the associations and obsessive thinking/intrusive thoughts.

In the end, I'd blow up aggressively at my loved ones when I didn't want to and it wasn't working out.

My therapist and I worked on assertiveness and how to practice it in situations where it's difficult for me to respond appropriately, where I need to say no, or disagree with someone, but in a respectful manner. Maybe you can bring this up to your therapist (saw you mention in the comments that you have one) and do some practices with them on how to speak assertively, not aggressively (aka no ""fuck you""s) and not submissively to people.

It was useful for me and helped me to overcome plenty of similar situations. Good luck!

SquantoJonesIV,1490459852.0,,,,,,,,t2_16hj6h,"The way you talk about things in your past seems detatched, but it does sound likes it's causing you some stress and confusion. Becoming more impulsive as you do more impulsive things is normal, because you feed into your impulsive side and are more used to being impulsive so those urges become your normal, making it harder to resist because it feels like that is who you are. 

My advice would be to look into getting an extended psychological evaluation, which is a process of seeing a therapist over month or so and doing some psychological testing. The therapist can then go over your results and sy.ptoms that think they see and you can move forward with ways to help you feel more in control and help you understand yourself better. You can do all the research in the world to try to figure out what YOU think is going on from a clinical perspective, but many times another person is better at catching things that may be concerning.

In the U.S. everything you say to a therapist is kept confidential and does not leave the therapy office or your chart.  

There are just a few exceptions, if you tell the therapist you have a plan to harm yourself or others and intend to act on this plan, or if you reveal any information regarding a child under 18 being abused.  At this point, a therapist is legally obligated to get you hospitalized for suicidal/homicidal ideation with intent to act on it, or report the child abuse information to the state.  

Other than those things, simply saying you have thoughts but have never fully intended to act out these thoughts, would not put you on any type of watch list.  A good therapist will revisit this with you often and check in to make sure that these thoughts don't become intent.  

Also, most good therapists would encourage you to hospitalize yourself if this was the case.  Generally, if you make the decision to hospitalize yourself, there are fewer legal, tracking ramifications than if you are forced to be hospitalized.

When people come to the realization that they actually possess the power to kill someone else (every single person has this power) and it is just a matter of your choice and will-power that stops you, it can be very anxiety producing and at times overwhelming.  

Many ask themselves ""What's to stop me from doing it?""  The answer is the same one that's been there all along.... you're there to stop you from doing it.  The overwhelming majority of people don't murder though almost every single person has thought about someone they'd like to.  

If either you feel overwhelmed by the anxiety caused by this or if you EVER feel as though you might lose control and act on these thoughts, seek professional help IMMEDIATELY.  Don't worry about upsetting or worrying a doctor or therapist.  We deal with this sort of thing all the time.  It's our job.  

Lastly, I'm sorry to hear that you experienced all of that as a child.  I think it might be good to see a therapist to talk about it anyway before anything manifests that could cause you or others severe problems down the line.  Good luck!

You are not responsible for the mistreatment you've suffered.  It's not your fault.  How you react and how you live your life after the fact is and always will be your responsibility.  Continuing to blame others will only keep you stuck.

I can tell you that the things you're experiencing are not normal, and you don't have to live with them forever. Therapy will help you. I know you don't think that psychology is very effective, but there's only one way to know if that's true, and that's to try it out. If you're desperate, what have you got to lose? 
There are different kinds of therapeutic methods, and some may work better for you than others. It's not all just talk therapy tell-me-about-your-childhood that people sometimes have negative stereotypes about. It sounds like you have a lot of anxiety and struggle with ways to cope and process those feelings, which is something that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is good at giving you tools to handle. 
Look up a few therapists in your area and reach out to one or two. Many will offer an initial consultation or meeting. If you meet up with someone and you don't click, or something feels off, then try out someone else. The relationship and rapport between the two of you is the most important thing. 
If you have any other questions feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to talk about stuff like this. I was in a pretty similar boat as you a little over a year ago and finding a therapist 100% saved my life.

If you're looking for a specific diagnosis or the answer to all of your problems you've had over the years, don't seek it from the internet.  I'm a therapist and have been working for years with every kind of person and I wouldn't give you a diagnosis based off of a Reddit post.  If you're concerned about this and it sounds like you are, go talk to a therapist.  Let them get to know you over several sessions.  You and they can figure out what your goals are and what you're interested in changing about yourself.  Then you'll get your answers.  

If you're in the U.S. I can answer any questions you might have about getting connected to therapy services.

I know this feeling so well. You sound like you DO need anxiety meds. They would at least take the edge off of the panicky feeling you have. I hated that feeling so much when I was in the Psych Hospital. I kept thinking that I would NEVER get out of there and never be able to cope while there. After a whole 2 days or so of panic, they gave me Clonidine, which helped IMMENSELY. I was able to focus on the groups and I even made friends while there. We would color and listen to music and just chat, and from then on, the rest of the week had flown by me. The next thing I knew, the Psychiatrist was telling me I was being discharged. I felt sad to be leaving, to be honest. Can you at least try to get involved with your peers at all? Go to the library or if they have a cafe for the students (the college our daughter goes to has a place called Gracie's and that is where all the kids meet up and hang out) or take a walk? Sorry if these don't help, but that is all I can think of. 

I hope you can get something for your anxiety soon. I still take Clonidine to this day (1 mg once a day) and it helps not only with my anxiety, but also my...firesetting behaviors. Heh.

anhuys,1481751890.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_13ko3t,"For us it comes down to a few things:

-	Identify what went wrong after we’re back to “normal,” and use that reflection well to then—
-	Make sure we know what the other needs and what we can do to help each other
-	If the other is being out of line or isn’t accepting help, simply say “I’m sorry, I want to help you but I can’t accept this so I’m leaving (you alone.) Please tell me if there’s anything I can do for you, in a respectful way.” / “I’m sorry, but I don’t know what I can do other than xyz. So I’m leaving (you alone.) If there’s anything I can do for you, you can hmu.” Mind you, we live together! :) 

You can’t demand that the other isn’t sick, but you *can* demand that they actively work on their problems or the way they deal with their problems. If nothing is improving, is that because of the illness or because of your way of dealing with it? Can you get therapy together, to help you navigate your relationship in these conditions? If it’s because of illness, is there potential for improvement? Are you doing anything to try and achieve that improvement? If you feel like there’s nothing in your behavior to improve, and no progress to (currently) be made in the health problems that are causing your struggles... You might just be incompatible.

*BUT* if you feel like there’s progress to be made in either the way you treat each other or your health, go for that! 

It sounds like you both need more help from outside your relationship, you can’t depend on each other to feel well when neither of you are always able to provide help. It makes for these situations you’re describing, where you unintentionally make each other feel worse. In that moment both of you need to find your peace and stability elsewhere. 

You need to stop feeling responsible for his wellbeing. If your help is not improving his condition, you need to accept it’s beyond your control. And that’s hard, but it’s necessary. Think about who or what can help him, and if he’s unwilling to look for or accept that help, that means you have to keep dealing with his condition. Be realistic about what that means, whether you can do that. 

You also need to learn to be okay yourself when he isn’t doing well. You both do. You need to stop blaming yourself when things are beyond your control, and you need to learn to feel okay when you’re apart! 

Sorry this became such a long comment, but basically

1.	Identify what you’re struggling with, and differentiate between whether it’s your relationship/own behavior or illness/beyond your control
2.	If it’s beyond your control, be realistic about whether that is acceptable/sustainable. If there’s potential, start working!
3.	You really need a safety net outside your relationship to take some strain off. You’re not each others psychiatrists or social workers, no matter how much you love each other and how strong your instincts to help are. If outside help can take some hits for you, your relationship won’t suffer the tension and you’ll be able to enjoy each other more.

And... always keep telling each other what you need and what would make you feel better!

Schizophrenia consists of positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, etc.), negative symptoms (lack of pleasure in things you used to enjoy, social withdrawal, poor hygiene, etc.), and cognitive symptoms (poor memory, difficulty concentrating, etc.). It's a common belief that schizophrenia is just psychosis (positive symptoms) and that antipsychotic medications treat every part of schizophrenia, but this just isn't true. Antipsychotics only treat some positive symptoms, and even then sometimes still aren't effective (I am an example of a certain antipsychotic worsening my auditory hallucinations).

Hannahbanajean,1535658435.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_23ly0qia,"I can hear that you are feeling so stuck right now but you did the right thing by going to your GP and talking about it here. As permanent as your feelings feel, as certain as your perception of the future is, the scope for people’s lives to grow and change is beyond what you can imagine right now. If I could leave you with one thing, it would be to plant a tiny seed of hope. You don’t have to fully believe me but I hope you can start wondering if maybe you will one day no longer feel trapped or stuck, and maybe things can get better. 

It sounds like you’ve been going through an extraordinarily stressful time, and that takes its toll. Final exams put huge emotional pressure on most people and it’s more common than you would think to begin to feel really trapped by them. I know you say it’s your fault but it sounds as though you are having very judgmental thoughts about yourself. I am sure that you have been doing your best and that you’ve had a lot of challenges to deal with. I also think that if you could zoom out from your life, you might see that taking some time out from school, or just taking a few days off wouldn’t be the end of the world. It can feel like that though when you’re racing to cram for deadlines, I know. I know you say that there’s no way you can get through your exams but I also bet that you are capable of so much more than you can imagine right now. I wonder if feeling so trapped has coloured your state of mind and is making it hard to see your strengths or to be kind to yourself. 

My advice would be to try not to worry too much about the time commitment of therapy, you have started the process and you will see what is available to you and a mental health professional will support you to make those decisions when a place becomes available to you. But seriously well done for taking that first step, it takes many people years to work up the courage to ask for support so don’t underestimate how important that was. 

And in the mean time I think it’s really important for you to think about how to support yourself. Who is in your life that you can turn to? Do you have any self-caring activities you could start doing to help you to boost your wellness and resilience? Even baby steps can make a difference: going for a five minute walk, listening to a soothing podcast- these all add up. And please don’t feel ashamed to call a helpline if you feel you could use someone to talk to. There will be someone on the other end of the phone to listen without judgment and to help you to work through your thoughts and that can be powerful. You can call the Samaritans on 116 123 for free, it won’t show up on your phone bill, and someone on the other end will be willing to listen with kindness 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 

But if you listen to nothing else I’ve said I really hope that you listen to this: if your thoughts of wanting to disappear become more intense, more frequent or compelling, if you start having thoughts of suicide or start thinking of a plan, please call a friend and ask them to accompany you to A&amp;E. I know it’s scary but I believe that you have such a bright future ahead of you, your life has so much meaning and worth and it’s really important that you keep yourself safe. If you feel frightened, you can always go back to your GP and explain that you are having these thoughts, or you can call 999 and let them know. It may feel dramatic, but it’s really actually incredibly brave and responsible. Trained  people will be available to help you. You may not be having these thoughts at all but I wanted to emphasise this because it’s I really feel that it’s so important to keep yourself safe. 

I know things are so hard right now and it must feel as though there is no way out. Sometimes I find it helps to break things down and just think: how will I get through the rest of the day? Or even the next hour? You could start by asking, “is there one tiny thing I have the energy and resources to do to show myself that I care about my wellbeing?” “Is there one tiny thing I can do to take a step towards studying for this exam or think about this essay” Maybe it’s just reading over what you’ve already written or reading the website of the course you’re interested in. When we’re overwhelmed, we can feel like nothing will help us get to where we need to be, and that can lead to paralysis. That’s common and understandable, and I don’t believe you’re using mental health as an excuse. It sounds as though you’re feeling very overwhelmed, understandably, and you are struggling with that. 

I really hope that you can find a way out of feeling trapped and overwhelmed soon. Final exams are the absolute worst. I wish you the best of luck with your exams though, with finding the good quality support you deserve to help you to thrive and with your future. I hope you prove yourself wrong and that all of it turns out better than you think. 

Edit: I just re-read the part about your uni essay being due tomorrow. This is horribly stressful but please give yourself a break. You wouldn’t have stayed in bed if things weren’t really challenging. All of what you’re dealing with is extremely hard. I hope you can talk to someone in your school/college and that you can get some support to figure out a plan and problem solve around this. But take it from me, almost nothing in life cannot be solved. It may take a bit longer or involve a slightly different path, but it’s not too late. Good luck.

sadistful,1540351616.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2gujsbe5,"my boyfriend and i both have multiple mental illnesses, some shared, others not. walking into our relationship, i assumed things would be easier because we shared disorders and therefore feelings, but that’s not always the case. there are going to be days where the two of you feel like complete strangers (rare, but it happens), and days where you’re going to be inseparable. here are a few ways my partner and i cope while maintaining our relationship. 

1. understanding that you can not cure each other. 
before meeting my boyfriend, i was fairly naive when it came to relationships, especially when mental health was involved. due to romanticization in media, i assumed that entering a relationship would immediately ease my mind and “fix” my disorders. that was not the case. no matter how much you love each other, no matter how close you are, you can not expect to heal each other of your disorders. 

2. determining when it’s time to pick each other up and make a change. 
there are days when my boyfriend and i reach all time lows, days when we completely shut down. whether it’s not talking at all, lying in bed for days, not eating, etc, it happens. it’s when days turn into weeks that something must change. try a new restaurant together, visit a local park, go for a walk together if you have the energy. try SOMETHING to change the destructive cycle — you don’t have to talk, you don’t have to vent, just try something together. 

3. drawing the line between abuse and projection. 
there might be times when the two of you begin to project negative emotions onto each other (whether it be yelling, blaming, etc). it’s when it becomes violent or mentally deteriorating that the two of you need to sit down and either attempt to calmly discuss your issues, or take a break from each other. you should NEVER feel like you’re unsafe in the relationship. 

4. creating a safety plan. 
unfortunately, my boyfriend and i are both heavily suicidal. one of the first things we ever did together when discussing our situation was create a safety plan in the event that one of us attempts suicide. as morbid as it was, we now have routes to the nearest hospital highlighted, a separate phone that’s always accessible and charged for contacting emergency services, a safe word, etc. 

5. schedule a day every week for the two of you to discuss your mental health. 
this was a step that drastically changed our relationship for the better. after a while of miscommunication and insecurity, my partner and i chose a day of the week (ours is friday) to just sit down at the end of the day and discuss what’s going on internally. not only does this clear up any doubts i may have about him loving me, but it also gives us a chance to clear our heads, bond, and vent. my boyfriend is no therapist, but he’s definitely my bestfriend.

I'm not wholesale condemning the rules. Virtually no one wants to encourage more suicide online. So we all agree that rules must be in place to prevent that. 

My contention is that *sometimes* the judgement of the mods is rather off. I'll be the first harsh critic of the mods to say that I think they actually do a an overall good job (70-90% of the time). It's the remaining 10% (which I have been a ""victim"" of/bore the brunt of) which drives my scorn. 

Unfortunately I can't be arsed to give you proof (I never saved the comments/posts about the 10s to 100s of people who complained about that SQL mod) and my own proof (couple of deleted posts and comments from a now deleted account) ""doesn't count"" so I'm not asking you to believe me 100% but know, just like how everyone is human and mistakes, SQL has made AT THE VERY LEAST 10s of mistakes on posts and comments. 

&amp;nbsp;

Look, if a post/comment is outright saying people should go kill themselves, I allow complete control: go ahead and immediately censor/delete/ban without anyone knowing.

The problem is the extremely gray areas. Instead of sticky-ing a response/comment warning about the language so that readers can make a judgement *for themselves*, the mods apply a zero tolerance policy: if upon a quick reading it's, *relative to them*, ""encouraging suicide"", immediately ban. Don't bother reading it completely to see the context. 

That means A LOT of work for the mods. Well, this world isn't fair and no system is perfect: the mods *should* do that for every post then (though by no means do they *need* to).

We had many reasons that lead us to be part of this trial, first as was mentioned in the article, we were desperate to help our son get better. He had already been on many medications without the results he needed. This was an opportunity to try something new. 

We also hoped to help advance the treatment of children with mental illness by being part of this trial. Much more needs to be learned about mental illness and how to treat it. That requires some research be done, which requires subjects to be part of that research. 

Unfortunately we had found that hospitals were not alway the best and safest place for children to be cared for, we felt it was much better for us to care for him at home while he was getting treatment. If you are interested in what can happen to a child in a behavioral health hospital here is a link to an article you may want to read.

Long story short - if you need something to stave off withdrawal, while also allowing you time and space to set up your new life (along with a security blanket in case you do use), suboxone is a pretty damn good solution. 

People generalizing those who are taking suboxone are doing just that - GENERALIZING. Recovery is deeply personal. If you can do it with no medication assistance, good on ya. All I know is I was hooked on oxy, and suboxone provided the stability and comfort I needed to move on with my life. It’s not for everyone, but it should be considered as an option if your addiction is far enough along. 


Ideally, if you can move on without any medication, do that. But, if you find you keep using and cannot quit, I’d recommend finding a doctor to work with for the sub.

So while I know it's not recommended to drink underage I will give you some tips since otherwise you might lose control again and it'll be worse. IMO it's better to teach young people to drink responsibly/safely  than to ignore the fact that they drink even after adults tell them not to. Because teens will drink no matter what.

Have a specific number of drinks for the night. Don't go over it and don't bring too much. You might go overboard if you do. For example, 3-4 drinks for 7 hours of partying since you're still pretty young. Take it slow. 

Eat before drinking. Drink same amount of water as alcohol between drinks!

Drink something different. Some types of drinks may be bad for you. Wine, beer, cider, long drinks, vodka, gin, whiskey, rum... if something gives you a bad experience, try something different. My sister can't drink vodka, I can't drink red wine. 

Drink something with low alcohol %.  Don't go for the hard stuff when you don't know your limits.

Don't steal from your parents. They WILL notice.

Don't drink homemade stuff or other people's drinks unless you 110% trust them. Other people's drinks can be spiked. Homemade stuff can be poisonous. You might lose your sight, you might die.

Don't leave your drink unattended at any time. Someone may spike it. It might happen while you look away. You can cover your drink with your hand if you look away. Absolutely do not go to the toilet/anywhere and leave your drink unattended. Professional spikers can do it in a heartbeat. You won't even notice it until it's suddenly morning. 

Don't take drugs or prescription medicine that react with alcohol when drinking.  Better yet, avoid drugs. 

Stay in safe company. Don't let friends wander off alone, tell your friends the same about you. 

I would avoid drunk sex to stay safe. 

Don't drink often. 

Don't let other people talk you into drinking more. Train yourself to say ""no"".

Abgahlorma,,,,[],,,,text,t2_2xbkptnw,"That made me smile. I actually sat down and thought about why it makes sense to pay premium on restaurant meals and takeout and got three reasons: (1) the time you save is more valuable than the money you spend; (2) restaurant meals are part of your job (such as taking clients to lunch or having other lunch meetings); (3) you've been cooped up so long that you have to do something nice for yourself in order to restore your spirits. I may be off on my math about the extent to which saving time loses its value once you're out of work compared to the increased value that keeping the money acquires, but for a 13-year veteran of the disability landfill like me it makes zero sense ever to spend extra money in order to save time on cooking. Conversely, to avoid ending up too downhearted to bother getting out of bed or taking a shower, I have to order a $25 pizza once in a while.

Worst come to worst, a smart person who expects to get another job will watch themselves for signs that they're getting slack, and try to address that by getting ready for work in the morning and leaving the house as if going to a job, then finding ways to stay busy until lunch, and afterwards finding ways to stay busy until end of shift.

I am NOT a doctor, but I did some Googling and found a bunch of posts on drugs.com about people experiencing anxiety/depression immediately after starting the Celexa (which btw I know from having previously discussed with my psychiatrist is a pretty potent drug). Also, after re-reading your post, I recalled that (many years ago!) I went on...I think it was Zoloft?...and within days felt 10x worse/suicidal. So, there actually might be something to how you're feeling--though of course this may all be anecdotal--and you may be feeling anxious and scared/depressed about starting a new drug regimen (I often feel this...it's really intimidating for me). 

Anyway, my advice does remain the same: call your psychiatrist to see if there IS a possibility that Celexa is causing these side effects so fast. He/she is there to answer your questions and be your advocate so you should take advantage of that.

Music was always a healthy coping skill.  Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins helped me realize I wasn't alone in my depression and there were others who had it bad like me.  


When I was in high school around 2003 or so two of the albums that would be the most influential to my adolescents came out.  Exit English by Strike Anywhere and Revolutions Per Minute by Rise Against.  The albums were so smart, passionate, and angry.  Not having been exposed to real punk music but only it's poppy cousin prior, it was unlike anything I'd ever heard and I fell in love.  The politics were in line with my worldview which helped growing up in a fairly conservative town and again, feeling like I was one of the only ones who felt the way I did.  


I loved the music so much that I started seeing Strike Anywhere and Rise Against and other bands at small venues.  I got my frustration out in the pit so I didn't have to bottle it up or take it out on myself in less appropriate settings.  I found a sense of community and a purpose in becoming more politically active.  


The community and purpose I got from the punk scene in the early 2000's was definitely one of the main contributors to saving my life.

A lot of the 'cannabis induced psychosis' stories in the media are scaremongering as opposed to real science but weed can definitely make you paranoid and a lot of people have found it can trigger genetics related psychosis issues so if you can I'd reccomend staying away from it. Though I know that's much easier said than done, I personally use weed but am careful to monitor how it might be affecting my mental health (and remember it can happen very slowly as well as quickly so you might not see a direct link unless you really watch out for it). It seems like it's detrimental to your mental health so try not to use it but if you can't stop completely then at least try to cut down to as little as possible as that's better than nothing.

Something I found to be helpful when I knew I needed to cut down on weed (not mental health related just bordering on a substance use disorder) was seeing it as a personal victory every day I didn't use. You could mark it down on something like a calendar and use it to say to yourself ""I did this because I wanted to and that's a win"".

She doesn’t really appear to be swinging in her moods. She just seems 24/7 irritated with humanity 😂 and when she gets happy its always speaking about how we will be millionaires one day blah blah blah

Sometimes when she jokes about being in a position of power her mom notes that she sounds like a dictator and thats exactly WHY she isn’t in a position of power

If she is depressed it will be very short lived, maximum a day. Usually she is... content I guess? Its difficult to read her sometimes. But her energy always remains the same even when depressed. 

And to be honest she’s the most paranoid person I know. I’ve never seen a human who is so against others and consistently suspicious. That never goes away.

So she chooses and selects very specific people to associate herself with

She’s very strange wanting attention from people while also not trusting them

Some examples would be that she is an open book and will easily talk about personal things while simultaneously believing everyone is going to go against her and is out to get her",,,,,1551991343,,,ei0rgh0,,t3_ayf3oz,,True,t1_ei0q8vh,/r/mentalhealth/comments/ayf3oz/i_20m_think_my_girlfriend_21f_has_npd_advice/ei0rgh0/,,1551991344,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,,,,,,False,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",,,,,,,,,,,

You are one year away from being independent. In ""abuse time"", that's forever, but it's not really. At that point she can not lawfully bother you anymore. You can cut her toxic shit right out of your life. 

Do you have friends who's parents might be supportive? I remember those days, walking the street at 16 without anything and nowhere to go.

I totally get there is worse things than cigarettes and am glad it never went farther. I was just like the goody goody kid so I was like I will never do any drugs or cigarettes. Over the years that kinda faded with weed as long as your not buying synthetic crap, it's natural and dosent harm you as long as you don't start too young. Part of the problem is that my boyfriend and I are chronic smokers, which I wasn't until I lived with him. Beforehand i was more of like a social smoker, would just do it with friends. Now it's daily and multiple times , it sucks cause it flip flops again. I want to stay as healthy as I can and quit to stop damage to my body and then its just like why care? I can tell my lungs are in worse shape than they were and my boyfriend was diagnosed with lung cancer at one point. When that happened he tried to quit but he's been smoking since 14. Almost ten years of smoking so it's alot harder for him to quit. He atleast was able to stop smoking cigarettes directly which he'd normally do at work. 

I get that taking pills isn't as bad as what I used to think since I'm so used to them, still kinda sucks but I've been on medication for nine years whether it was anti depressants, birth control or sleeping pills or all at once. It just seemed easier to stop than argue. 

I'm sure there will be a program or something that will help cover some costs of therapy, I'm just hoping I'll be able to cover the rest.

If you feel that such obsessions are problem or they create problems later on, I highly suggest you to get a professional help. It doesn't necessarily mean that you need help only if you are hurting yourself. Even if such behaviour or ""obession"" causes emotional discomfort, it is time to seek help.

Please be aware of the fundamental nature of human beings. Our basic needs must be satisfied in order for us to live an acceptable life. And our ""emotional comfort"" need is I believe the most important one. People can get sick physically, like injuries or headaches etc. and they get treatment in order to feel ""comfort"". When it's the emotional aspect of comfort, we tend to think either such support seeking is bad or ""i think i can handle"". There is nothing wrong with seeking help, it is just for being more comfortable in the life.

It sounds like you're wrestling a lot with everything, particularly in looking for a therapist. I think that this is probably a good starting point. If you're at university, there's a good chance there's a therapist available through them (I don't know this for a fact, I know this is the case in Canada). Anxiety can be hard to manage and it can feel like you're stuck at the bottom of a well, and looking up at the exit that seems way too far away and unattainable. Try to look away from that far-away exit and look in front of you and think what's something I can do right now. For example, if I need to study for a test that covers half a semester. Wow that seems a lot to do, so much information. But what if I see begin to see that okay, there's 4 chapters covered in this test. I have 4 days to study (hopefully more!). I can set a smaller goal of studying one chapter a day, if that's still to much, break the chapter down into sections.  


I'm not sure if you're still on your medication, but I encourage you to continue to stick to it. It can be tough with side effects, but in the long run, they help your brain to begin to re-wire and have an influence on how you see the world and experiences.

It really is a bitter pill when you realise you've missed out on typical experiences that most people have had.

Some people will tell you that it doesn't matter or that you can still form new and positive experiences and all of that shit. But I dunno, it does stunt you I think. 

Sure, you can still go forth and enjoy your remaining time on this earth but looking back and seeing nothing really stops me dead in my tracks and is just a reminder of bad times. It's really hard, for me at least, to accept that I've completely wasted my youth. 

When I was growing up, people always seemed to remind me how shit life got as you got older and how I should appreciate my youth. Adults always seemed bitter, miserable, lost for the most part. I would see their lives and think how I may avoid it. Then I became an adult myself, and now when I look back I should see good times, positive experiences, life lessons etc but I just see nothing. It's really hard for me to not be bitter and sad about it, but I'm not sure how it is for you.

I guess it's just crushing to look back and see nothing, and look forward and see nothing.

I feel pretty much the exact same way as you especially in regards to the dating thing. I am also in the best possible position I've been in for many many years too, but it hasn't gotten any better.

Wish you all the best. I'm really sorry I don't have much to offer you in terms of advice, I just needed to respond as I strongly relate to what you wrote.

I guess I can suggest you not dwell on the past and simply focus on making your present and future as positive and fulfilling as possible.

I don't know where you live, but here in Finland if you go to a private GP clinic to see a psychologist, it costs 100e. Currently I'm seeing a private therapist and she has her own company, her appointments cost 90e per session. The government pays 66e from each visit, and I pay the rest. I guess it's around the same wherever you're living, depending on if the government covers some of it.

I know the feeling, it was a bit scary to think that I would be on medication for the rest of my life, but that's sometimes how it is. Anyway, in the end it's not a big deal. It's the same as if someone would take pills for their rheuma or someone taking breaths from their asthma pipes. Anyway, most people recover and answer so well to their therapy treatment combined with meds that in the end they can slowly start taking smaller doses of their meds.

What it comes to the cigarettes - it could be a lot worse. Like, you could be addicted to very strong drugs or in-vein drugs. I know cigarettes are bad for your health but in my opinion it's not the worst. Maybe you could switch to lighter cigarettes? I've never been a bad smoker but every now and then I smoke few menthol cigarettes to chill. So don't take the cigarettes too seriously, but I think it's good you've been far away from weed. :)

I was the popular kid all throughout my time in mandatory education. Even switched schools in 6th grade and still managed to make it on the new schools court for prom. Might’ve snagged prom king but we had a special needs guy who was awesome and everybody loved so he deserved it. The only reason I got all these people to like and talk to me is because I knew what they wanted to hear.

Learned that skill from my mom. She’d beat the shit out of me and my siblings when we were young. Each of us had different tactics to not get whooped as much. Mine was to learn her as well as I could. To learn what makes her happy and what doesn’t. Only do what makes her happy. 

I took this mentality out into the world as well and soon it had seeped into every one of my interactions. I changed myself entirely depending on who I was talking to. I learned what each individual liked and I became that when I was forced to speak to them. Then immediately after I would tear off my fake face and fall back into my pit of loneliness. 

I felt completely alone. I talked to so many people everyday but none of the conversations meant anything. Just a way to upkeep our relationship. I’d smoke weed for an escape. Just a few hours of peace I feel ya man. 

A LOT of shit happened that led to me gettin out of that dark place no time to get into it. One of the biggest things tho was learning to truly open myself up to someone. The conversations stopped feeling hollow and I made some true friends. Not like the old friends who only knew one of my masks these people got to see the real me. It was hard as fuck but the rewards are well worth it. 

The social environment created by the education system is horrendous. Kids are pushed into social groups and have very little social mobility. So much of it is fake too. So much gossip, so much worrying about what others think of you. It really diminishes human interaction. Holds us back from really connecting. For real tho, the outside world is nothin like that. I promise.

This planet is full of people who would love to hear what you have to say. You just gotta find them. I’m not sayin it’ll be easy tho. Nothin in life worth doin is easy.

Trust me go to the doctor get diagnosed your dealing with depression I also had the same issue sharp pains and all those symptoms it’s depression I will explain how I got better because I only talk based of what I experienced hopefully this could help you out . The hardest thing for me to do was to share my story to anyone I always felt guilty or scared of how ppl would react my suggestion would be go to the doc and explain everything that’s going on in your life because it feels like a weight has been lifted off your back then the next step is to get therapy, what I did when my doctor told me it was depression I had no idea how to cure it so I did a bunch of research ways to cope with it and how to overcome it cause at the time I personally felt I couldn’t and from my research / Journaling: Meditating/ Exercising/ Eating omega3s and eating healthy because I used to binge eat and some foods would fuck up my day like pizza so finding the right foods to enlighten your mood and Reading books and books that could help you . But I for sure can speak from experience take the first big step go to your doc and explain everything because after you come out you will feel motivated to invest in yourself and self improve because at that time I had nobody to help me and I was sucidale everyday felt nobody cared when I opened up I felt I had someone who had my back and now I’m getting help so that’s the big step you should make . Killing yourself is neve the answer . Where you are you dug a hole but the light is still there taking steps at a time to reach that light it will take time but you will realize what life is about that is something my doc kept telling me which motivated me to improve because it sucks we gone through Narc abuse but it’s our job to get help and face this issue we are dealing with , if you have any questions you can dm me I personally feel like it’s my job to help others because of how fortunate I am to receive help from people sometimes people don’t have that so msg me if you want to vent about something or anything !

lmao_3,,,,[],,,,text,t2_jipcp4a,"I feel you. Maybe not to the same extent but I feel you. I had toxic friends for the first year of college and they kinda treated me like trash. Cause of that and a couple of other factors (a bad break up) I became socially anxious and depressed. I got so anxious to the point I couldn't get up in the morning because my anxiety would kill me from the moment I got up. 

For the first year of college I had no real friends and I had to act like an idiot all the team to get approval from my roommates and I hated it because I felt like an idiot having stoop so low for validation. 

In the first semester I got into drinking and a bit of smoking to help avoid the constant anxiety and depression. 

From the second semester I started meeting new people and completely cut my drinking. I started reading self help books and started talking to my family about my anxiety and closest friends. I started avoiding my toxic friends in college and started meeting new people. It was soooooooo hard being myself because everytime I tried to be I just felt like no one would like me and everyone hated me it was impossible to do anything. I started meditation which made a huge difference in my life and talking to my closest friends helped a lot. 

In third semester I had multiple break downs because I still had no friends despite my efforts kept getting cucked from group trips and outings and my academics plummeted everything sucked. And finally in the fourth semester I met a couple of guys that were kinda like me and for the first time in college I felt accepted. 

Basically all I'm saying keep meeting new people try and be nice and man up a lil and take a few risks. Talk to your family, closest friends, maybe try therapy again, start something interesting you like and keep at it (I do graphic design and kinda draw to help ease my anxiety) and meditate (if you want to, helped me a lot).

This quote from the book The Man Who Was Thursday by G. K. Chesterton has really helped me: “Bad is so bad, that we cannot but think good an accident; good is so good, that we feel certain that evil could be explained.”

For me, every day is a struggle (anxiety, depression, PTSD), but there are good times. Sometimes long stretches of good times. Sometimes so good that I think I’m cured, but I’m not. I have a million little triggers and I struggle, but I’m still fighting and I am grateful every day that when I tried to commit suicide (age 13) it didn’t work.

A lot of people like to use grounding techniques, but it doesn't really help for me. It's where you look around and find 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch.. etc.

Thank you for sharing so much of your life and struggles with us. I hope I can give you some thoughts that can help.

1-Please stop describing yourself as ""fucked in the head."" The way we talk to ourselves and about ourselves creates our self-belief. So negative talk about yourself will lead you to believe negative things. 

It sounds like you feel you're not worthy of your boyfriend. I want to tell you that you absolutely are worthy of him! He chose YOU! From all the ladies around that he could talk to he talks to YOU, smiles at YOU, thinks about YOU, and finds YOU special. You're not a burden to him

2-I think becoming more confident in your skin would be helpful. Some tips I have for developing confidence are dressing better, surrounding yourself with positive voices, only speaking positively of yourself, journaling positive things about yourself/writing affirmations, and work out. I strongly believe when we look better we feel better. Maybe dress up here and there just for you. I purposely dressed up in polos and khakis for 30 days to monitor my confidence and it grew. Working out helps too because it gets that energy out, focuses your mind, and is fun. Loving yourself stems from saying lovely things to yourself and believing the things you say.

3-Your bullies were liars and they were insecure themselves. The reason they made fun of anyone is that they needed to project their hatred onto someone. I'm so sorry that was you. The reason you may believe some terrible things and say terrible things to yourself is that you're still listening to their opinions of you. Please please please, value your own opinion of yourself more than their opinions of you.

4-Make time for self-care. I don't mean a spa day or whatever. Make time for yourself OP, outside of your relationship. Go explore your hobbies, go to your favorite restaurant, drink your favorite drink, or watch your favorite movie. Get into the habit of celebrating yourself,

5-Absolutely cut out all the negative people or severely limit your exposure to them. Those voices are poison. They will taint you and rot you to the core. I know from experience.

6-Practice gratitude. Find little things or big things to be thankful for. When you're able to do this habitually it reshapes the way you think. You'll find yourself being grateful for stuff like your hair or the way your eyes sparkle.

OP you're wonderful for sharing and being wonderful. You're a spectacular girlfriend for realizing that things may impact your relationship. I don't think many people take thoughtful action like you. I interpret your post to mean that you care about your partner, want to give him the best version of yourself, and want to be the best version of yourself. That is nothing short of lovely.

I'll say it one more time, you're a great girlfriend to a great guy!",,,,,1559265651,,,epk1qx0,False,t3_bus3ee,,True,t3_bus3ee,/r/mentalhealth/comments/bus3ee/im_really_insecure_about_the_fact_im_mentally_ill/epk1qx0/,,1559265652,2,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,,,,,,False,{},1559823318.0,[],False,0.0,,,,,,,

KittenWays,,,,[],,,,text,t2_3j26b0yq,"I have this problem too! It's been with me for about 3 years now and it's sooooo frustrating. Like, you KNOW it's not funny and you don't even want to laugh, but your brain just decides to make you laugh. It's embarrasing when no one's laughing and you're there giggling.

I've tried a BUNCH of things. Usually they work for like a few days then it stops and I try something else. There's no trick that works for everyone all the time, but some of these might be helpful:

\-I squeeze my hands really tight. You can try biting your tongue or pinching yourself. It just relieves the pressure from laughing I guess.

\-Laugh in your head. Laugh ALL you want, just laugh and laugh away. Because you're not controlling yourself from laughing, you're letting it happen just not out loud. I tried a few times, works a bit.

\-Use sarcasm. Think sarcastically, ""haha this person dropped a pencil. sooooo funny'. It used to work for me.

\-Do math. I saw this tip online but like personally it's hard because you have to put your full mental effort into it, which I hate. Just think, what's 35x22 and focus on solving it, do the old elementary 'long multipilcation process'. It helps distract you for the time being. Or you can skip numbers or something.

\-Think of something sad. Like, extremely sad. I sometimes think of the bad things that happened in life and it helps ease the laughter.

\-I used to do this years ago, before I had this problem (so I could beat others in the, try-not-laugh-challenge). I would watch/read funny stuff on the Internet (the hardest challenge is watching people laughing EXTREMELY hard, because laughter is contagious. There's tons of these on Youtube). Just sit there and practice not laughing.

\-Take deep breathes. I also used to think, 'But if I do that, I might end up bursting out loud with laughter?' It actually worked for me. Let yourself laugh, take deep breathes, like really deep. It actually helps the smile go away.

\-This trick I'm doing right now. You know how, when you watch a video alone you can watch it with a straight face and not show any emotion? Yet, when you watch the same video with someone else everything just suddenly seems funny and you laugh at every thing you didn't before? I take a few deep breaths and imagine I'm alone, and everyone around me is just a video or I'm watching TV. It helps bring that 'numbness' back, because I'm just ""watching a TV show"" and nothings really that funny.

\-Another trick I do right now is, if something funny happens, do NOT look at people laughing. It's contagious and it may cause you to laugh uncontrollably as well. However, if I'm in the middle of the episode, I glance up at everyone's faces, realize no one is laughing anymore, and you can feel the smile just kind of fade. Just glance around the room and find a serious face, it helps me stop laughing. 

I definetely had more tips, I just can't remember them right now. However, I'll post again if I remember!",,,,,1559265116,,,epk0zfq,False,t3_buv64z,,True,t3_buv64z,/r/mentalhealth/comments/buv64z/im_laughing_at_almost_everything_when_im_in/epk0zfq/,,1559265117,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,,,,,,False,{},1559823139.0,[],False,0.0,,,,,,,

zafiroblue05,,,,[],,,,text,t2_346tv,"This is a great article that might be really interesting to you, particularly the opening story in Cambodia and then the  ""grief exception"" section. https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/2/25/16997572/causes-depression-pills-prozac-social-environmental-connections-hari

The long and short of it is that depression has biological, psychological, and social causes. For many years the narrative around depression was primarily biological -- ""chemical imbalance in the brain."" But scientists now believe that such imbalances simply do not exist. There are biological causes but our understanding of them is simply not complete. Then the narrative considerably focused on psychological causes, particularly the CBT model in which illogical negative thoughts cause suffering. But some studies have shown that CBT is no more effective than other therapies and that a connection between patient and therapist is the best predictor of whether therapy will help. That leaves social causes. Recent years have seen increases in depression and suicide... I think that could be precisely due to the deteriorating social situation in the world (technology, politics, xenophobia, climate change).

Often people like to medicalize depression, to counter the depressive's thought pattern that ""I'm depressed because my life really does suck."" That may be a helpful strategy, maybe not. But you might have been depressed when you because a genuine lack of social connection or frustrations at work. You might not be depressed now because of the formation of genuine social connections and personal accomplishment at work.

There are no easy answers, but I'd say with your kids make sure they know they are loved, and make sure they have the freedom to pursue a purposeful life.

lotgisch,,,,[],,,,text,t2_35jjstqz,"Been there about one and a half years ago, and back then I was convinced of the fact I would live the rest of my life with a constant crippling fear of dying any moment of the day. Luckily, it didn’t go that way at all. The first two weeks after my first attack I spent with my parents, had to abandon my studies for that time because I couldn’t even leave the house, let alone go to uni. Within those three weeks I managed to find a therapist, and immediately went working on fixing stuff. The first few sessions were like hell, because I had to leave the house, take public transport and walk the streets. At that time, what kept me quite sane was just constantly telling myself that the people around me would help me in case of an emergency, which already somewhat lowered the initial anxiety and a chance of a panic attack.

Then I started reading a lot about panic attacks, and all the effects it actually has on your body. At one point I was really afraid to lose my eyesight, which I found out was a “surviving mode” of your eyes going in some kind of tunnel vision. This is just one example, but it eventually really helped me to know that the things I experienced were nothing to be scared of. It was my own fear of those things that drove me insane. My therapist gave me little assignments to prove to myself I wouldn’t get a heart attack if I would run the stairs, I wouldn’t go blind if I looked into light, I wouldn’t get schizophrenic or get Alzheimer’s when I couldn’t remember what I had to buy for groceries. Just a small list of all things I had to prove to myself to gain confidence. The more I did this the less the panic attacks came back. It took about two/three months to be fully back on track and almost two years later I rarely think about it anymore.

Give it time, but try to keep challenging yourself. Don’t push it of course, but getting afraid of the fear itself is definitely not what you want and need right now.

dmn2e,,,,[],,,,text,t2_6nzxe,"Can you or anyone else help me understand depression?  I feel like I have experienced it as a teenager, and perhaps through some of my college years.  I was introverted and uncomfortable making new friends.  I didn't have a lot of drive and it took me an extra few years to get focused and graduate college.  But after a while, it just seemed to go away.  As a teenager I had many thoughts of suicide.  I beat myself up pretty hard over mundane things I may have done in social situations......things like saying the wrong thing at the wrong time and then losing sleep over it later, or a small mistake at work that made someone else have to pick up my slack.....things like that.  I tell myself that I grew up and matured, and learned not to get so worked up over petty things.  I still lack a certain drive to better myself, but I'm working on it.  But overall, I'm in a good place now......professionally and mentally.

I had a friend that passed away recently.  He had bipolar disorder, and after he passed we learned of other details that seemed to be (to me and other friends of his, though we're not the most knowledgeable) symptoms of schizophrenia.  He had his first manic episode about 10 years ago.  From what I heard, it sounded like he had a really bad day and got fired from his dream job.  After that, it seemed like his mental illness was triggered, and he spiralled out of control for a bit.  He got help and medication.  But, because of him losing his dream job, I can totally understand how anyone, bipolar or not, could fall into a similar depression.  Now, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are particularly hard to manage, so I'm not trying to generalize people with these disorders with those that just have depression.

I guess my question overall is, is depression often triggered by stress and/or mental trauma?  And if so,  is taking medication a band-aid for depression, or do people typically need to stay on medication for the rest of their lives?  Is depression a mental obstacle that people overcome with focus and therapy/support?  You mentioned that despite your coworkers greeting you in the morning you felt that they were making fun of you.  Is overcoming those negative thoughts (much, much easier said than done) and moving past it even a possibility with depression, or are there other factors I'm unfamiliar with?

I hope I haven't made any terrible assumptions or offended anyone, I'm just trying to understand it a little better, and the only experiences I've had with it were my own thoughts and feelings as a teenager/young adult, and through finding out from the puzzle pieces left behind after my friend died.

Also, most importantly, I have two kids now.  If they go through anything similar as they get older, does anyone know if there is anything I can do to help them (or anyone else I my come across) that has depression?

I'm as pessimistic as they come but even I think it really will reach people (eventually) if you keep sharing. Too many victims of trauma deny and/or delude themselves and your story (along with other similar success stories) is needed. It would be ideal if it can be repeated to get awareness (first step; making sure availability of resources is an equally important next step) for for victims/others.

Yeah...this is what OP is talking about: people fixated on literally forcing the (very) treatment resistant depressed to live (and telling them it IS worth it ie ""lying"" that it's a ""guarantee"" that it's ""worth it"").

1. Watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jhcxOhIMAQ&amp;t=10s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jhcxOhIMAQ&amp;t=10s)
2. Make a list of 10 good things you're thankful and grateful for. (hint: if you have 2 arms, 2 legs, eyesight, that's already way more than some people have). Repeat this every day for 30 days and try not to repeat the same things- think creatively. The goal is to force you into a positive frame of mind, because our brains respond according to whatever we feed it, whether positive or negative. Go ahead and prove me wrong by actually doing it 100%.
3. Volunteer to help others. Everyone feels useful and valued when others value you. Others can be very dependent and they need you. There are many unmet needs in this world- what if you met just one of them for another? You don't need to be 100% perfect or stable or confident with yourself or great in every way. A warm body who delivers meals to elderly is highly appreciated regardless, someone who helps at a homeless shelter or hospital or children's program, teach someone your language, help kids with homework at the library, help with church outreach, etc. is valued just as you are. When you start regularly providing a useful service to these needy folks you will feel better about yourself, guaranteed. Prove me wrong. This takes a little longer to setup sometimes as some have orientations, coordinators you need to go through, but this action will have the most impact. It may remove a cloud from you and open your eyes to new possibilities. You are welcome to DM me. I will be your friend. I wrote this all for you. I'm doing #3 right now and feel good about it.

I would call a close friend or relative that understands what you are going through. I would do it on the clock too. I don't know your full situation but I would ask if this friend/relative can come get you. You do not need to be at work while suffering from PTSD.
If you need this job, or  have no one to call then I would find a quiet dark room with a lock and meditate. I understand you said your having issuing controlling your breathing and I get that. I also have PTSD and sometimes you just can't sit, breathe, and relax. I find a dark quiet room helps. Almost like a sensory deprivation tank.

Tumorhead,,,,[],,,,text,t2_50yir,"the therapist may just be doing her own version of trauma processing that she's out together in her own from simply lots of experience. It sounds very similar to what my therapist does, and my therapist is an old trauma specialist (I'm 30f dealing with CSA too). I think some  experienced therapists independently come to the same method conclusions? Mine has me imagine  what my safe space would look like, so I can have a place to retreat to when I'm in a flashback. On my own I've done trauma processing via  visualizations  similar to what you described and it has been very effective.  

successful processing should make the memory of abuse less overwhelming. The goal is to put the memory back together so it can be put away properly. This just has to do with how the brain encodes traumatic events. By revisiting the memory with one's adult mind, we can understand it differently and let ourselves feel the emotions trapped with it. By doing that the  the mind can finally put it  into ""storage"". The goal is to make the memory feel less like it's still happening, and to make the patient less reactive to it. if unprocessed memories of abuse triggering acute suffering is like touching a hot stove, processed memories are like feeling a bonfire from a hundred feet away. you can tell it still burns and you can go over there and hurt yourself on it again, but you're not trapped in the fire anymore.

CPTSD recovery is long and arduous and I salute your support of your wife!! my husband has my back but it's still hard for him too and I am eternally grateful for him supporting me.

gurneyhallack,,,,[],,,,text,t2_9zkvzo3,"My therapist is a relational therapist. It is the main break in therapy modalities. There is the cognitive model, the medical model, all of which is based on CBT, and there is the interpretive model. This is psychodynamic therapy, relational therapy, schema therapy, family systems therapy, and such. 

The original model of therapy. Psychodynamic specifically is modernized Freudian stuff, and the other models each have their own complex theory. These therapies are evidence tested within the medical model, studied and proven, but they themselves are not medical model in and of the themselves. Experiential and somatic stuff, stuff to do with movement or the body or acting things out, this is based on gestalt therapy. Gestalt does not have the solid evidence base the rest of them all do as a full therapy. 

But the techniques within it are evidence tested, when combined with relational, psychodynamic, or indeed with CBT if you can figure out how to work it into CBT. It is good therapy, that has been proven. Often it is a bit longer term than CBT type stuff. But its based on that older model, interpretation, insight, rather than direct skills and goals. It has helped me a ton. Not everyone prefers it just like some people dislike the medical model. That is largely preference, because we know both work.

I do agree though, minimalizing is very freeing. Just weeding out crap and knowing what you own and where things are is very helpful. And avoiding unneeded responsibility.

So I’ll just give you some information on each and how they’re defined in the DSM-V.

Major depressive disorder with psychosis: a depressive disorder with the presence of symptoms like hallucinations or delusions. We often think of schizophrenia when there are hallucinations/delusions but there’s numerous disorders that can present these symptoms.

Schizoid and schizotypal are both cluster A personality disorders. Clusters are just how we organize the types of personality disorders.

Schizoid personality disorder - marked by a lack of desire for close relationships. Can include depressive symptoms.

Schizotypal personality disorder - marked by a fear of social interaction due to a deep seated fear of people. Can include depressive symptoms, delusions, and hallucinations.

Autism would be part of a dual diagnosis. It’s separate from the rest but can occur alongside the rest. Major depressive disorder could also be a part of a dual diagnosis as it can occur alongside the rest. So you could have multiple diagnosis.

Up-Town,,,,[],,,,text,t2_oi79uhv,"Rosie, if your BF has strong BPD traits as you suspect, he likely experienced a trauma in early childhood (from inherited genes and/or his environment) that prevented him from acquiring certain emotional skills. Most major cities offer excellent treatment programs (e.g., DBT, TFP, and CBT) that can teach a pwBPD the coping skills he never had an opportunity to learn in childhood. 

Such a program can teach him how to do self soothing; how to regulate his own emotions; how to intellectually challenge intense feelings instead of accepting them as ""facts""; and how to trust others. It also can teach him how to be ""mindful"" (i.e., to remain in the room instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future); how to perceive ""object constancy"" (i.e., to see that your personality and devotion to him are essentially unchanged day to day); and how to avoid black-white thinking by learning to tolerate strong mixed feelings, uncertainties, ambiguities, and the other gray areas of interpersonal relationships.

Sadly, it is rare for a high-functioning pwBPD to have the self awareness and ego strength to remain in such a program long enough to make a real difference. Like learning to play a grand piano, it takes many years of hard practice for a pwBPD to acquire those missing coping skills. 
Hence, DBT is effective only if the pwBPD is self aware and strongly motivated to work hard for years in learning these skills. 

In my case, I spent a small fortune sending my exW to 6 different psychologists (and taking her to 3 MCs) for weekly sessions for 15 years. Sadly, it did not make a dent in her behavior. Not one dent.

If your BF actually is an untreated pwBPD, the one thing that is certain is that you will see big improvements in his behavior. Like the smoker who is always throwing away his ""last pack"" every two months, he likely will make dramatic improvements about every 6 to 8 weeks. That's how unstable people behave. 

I mention this because, if you decide to put your life on hold to see if he is serious about working on his issues, it is going to be extremely difficult for you to know whether he is actually making any real, lasting improvement.

"" A.11.b. Values Within Termination and Referral

Counselors  refrain  from  referring  pro-spective and current clients based solely on the counselor’s personally held val-ues,  attitudes,  beliefs,  and  behaviors.  Counselors  respect  the  diversity  of  clients  and  seek  training  in  areas  in  which they are at risk of imposing their values onto clients, especially when the counselor’s values are inconsistent with the  client’s  goals  or  are  discriminatory  in nature. ""

Bringing her own religion into it is a pretty obvious violation of that. The version I found is from 2014, but I can't imagine it's changed since then.

As far as flashbacks/panic attacks go, many therapists recommend techniques such as grounding exercises, mindfulness, somatic exercises such as progressive muscle relaxation, and good old cognitive behavioral therapy.

Personally, touch and aroma therapy are helpful to me to calm me down enough to move to something like mindfulness. For example, I carry both sides of a piece of Velcro with me at all times. When I feel panic, I grab it and focus on the way it feels on my skin. Then I start working on noticing my breathing. Then I do small things to be aware of my surroundings-colors, shapes, etc- and so on.

A couple of things that helped me:

* Start with small steps - just give a smile to people, men and women. Try make eye contact. When paying for items at the super market, ask how the cashiers day is going. These require effort, but its small enough that is possible without being daunting. Even when walking down the street, just give someone a smile.

My first time trying Zoloft resulted with full blown serotonin toxicity syndrome, which manifest itself very similarly to this. It's abnormal to have a reaction so quickly, but I was full blown manic but anxious within an hour. I could not sleep, and I was jittery and shaky, developing into odd muscle tension and twitches. I had intermittent fevers, and panic attacks, eventually developing into absolute confusion and psychosis. I had several suicidal hallucinations during that week which caused nightmares for months.

After about a year of no medication, I met with another psychiatrist, and together we found out that I was just really susceptible to all chemicals and medications he prescribed. He theorized that my blood brain barrier was abnormally porous, and would therefore let in more chemicals to my brain than is typical.

If it sounds at all remotely similar, call your psychiatrist and make sure they're aware. They may just say to stay on it for a little while, but make sure that if it develops at all from that point, you let them know.

sdchibi,,,,[],,,,text,t2_14x3rx,"I'm so glad I didn't scare you away with that huge wall of text I posted. I must be getting to the age where I have enough life experience to fill a book :) Now, just to be clear I am not a doctor or mental health professional. I just like to share what I've learned and give my (non-professional) opinion. 

It sounds to me like you're afraid of being diagnosed with schizophrenia and are trying to avoid the possibility of being diagnosed. I'm not saying this as an accusation or some kind of negative judgement against you; I just can't seem to word that without it sounding harsh. The possibility of having any serious illness or disorder can be very scary, especially if there might be a hospital stay involved. A mental illness like schizophrenia has a lot of misrepresentation in popular media and stigma attached to it which I think adds a lot to its fear factor. 

So, I don't blame you for getting scared and not wanting to answer those questions truthfully. I think that's an understandable reaction that a lot of people would also have if they were faced with it. I don't think it's an effective approach to getting what you need, though. I think it would be better to explain your symptoms as honestly as possible to your therapist and go from there. 

It still might be something besides schizophrenia, but even if it is schizophrenia it can be very well controlled, and it doesn't mean you're going to be locked up in a hospital just from those symptoms all on their own. A person would usually need to be considered a danger to themselves or others. If I saw black blobs but knew that they weren't real and I also wasn't actively suicidal or homicidal then I wouldn't expect to be hospitalized against my wishes. If I saw black blobs, thought that they were real, and tried to escape from them by knocking people over or running into the street then I wouldn't be surprised if I got hospitalized. You know what I mean?

Anyway, the point of me saying all of this is that I think you're suffering more and for longer than you could be. I think if you are honest and open about your symptoms you'll have a much better chance of feeling well again sooner. As a fellow human with a misbehaving brain, I hope you find your answers and feel better soon!",,,,,1570129904,,,f2br3w2,False,t3_dcdaig,,True,t1_f2agl1i,/r/mentalhealth/comments/dcdaig/i_am_seeing_black_blobs/f2br3w2/,,1570135209,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,,,,,,False,{},,[],False,0.0,[],[],,,,,

journey_j,,,,[],,,,text,t2_3ua4icbc,"I relate to this so deeply.

 I stayed quiet about childhood abuse from a family member for mostly all my life because I didn't want to hurt other family members and cause them pain. So I just tried to keep quiet and keep it buried deep inside. But it never really went away. I felt like my soul was rotting from the inside. For ten years I felt like my soul was rotting. Finally, at one point the pain and anger and depression just boiled up to the point where my emotions bursted out. I told EVERYONE what happened, and that I wanted that person out of my life and family. I basically made my parents choose between the abuser and me. Which was hard for them because abuser was their child and also given them grandchildren. And yes my outburst and demands caused a lot of pain and conflict and it was a painful, difficult time for everyone. But afterwards, I finally felt understood by my family. Abuser admitted to what they did and apologized and we are on a slow path to amending our relationship, which I didn't even believe was possible before then.

Honestly I don't think things will ever be fully okay between me and abuser, and I will never be able to fully trust them. I've known them all my life but I will never feel completely comfortable near then, But at least now I know things can be better and I don't have to feel that gut wrenching mental pain. I know this sounds really cliche but forgiveness is something you do for yourself, not for the wrongdoer. My heart goes out to you because I relate so much to what you wrote.

It's important to acknowledge your feelings, and it took me a long time to finally be able to say that I wasn't okay and that I wasn't getting what I needed from my friends/family.

If you want to talk big and bad, get a degree in it and study it for as long as I have, and then get in the field and work with people with mental disorders like I have. Practicing psychology doesn't mean one has to be a therapist, but you would know that if you had studied it. (2)

It sure is nice to paint a pretty picture of what I want, but I realized that fantasy has no place in relationships with other people, at any level, and you have to accept that things won't always work the way we idealised, but that doesn't mean that all of it will be bad.

Hydn7822,,,,[],,,,text,t2_es8gz1e,"""  I’ve been terrified to seek help as I’m a very shy, awkward, anxious person  ""  


Ha. Do you know what my therapist asked me on the first meeting? ""Are you by any chance taking recreational drugs?""   


The reason for this is because I sometimes speak about 4,000 MPH, especially when I am passionate about something, such as psychology. I get very excited, which then leads to headaches. When I sit for too long, I find myself tapping my fingers and tapping a foot, its nervous energy for sure.   


For years I would try to burn off that energy by working very hard. I would push myself harder than anyone else. Not to show off, but because I needed to burn off something which, as it turns out, was anxiety creeping up on me. Eventually, tho, the anxiety became too much. I had a full-blown panic attack. I recall the exact day, and where I was. I just got out of work and suddenly felt my heart trying to bust from my chest. Then a sweat, then, well, that is when the sky began to collapse. What happens is the fight or flight response seems to go out of control.   


  
May I ask your age? I ask because you may be able to just go to a therapists office. Or, you could even go to your local hospital. I get that it sounds scary, but sometimes it is best to rip off the band-aid quickly. If you go to a hospital, all you do is tell them , honestly, how you feel. They hear it a lot, trust that. Nobody there would ever judge you, nor will they lock you up on a padded cell. Unless, of course, they decided you were an actual threat to yourself. It all depends on how you are feeling at that point, obviously. I would really recommend going for it. The first day I went to see a therapist, we hadnt even gotten into a long talk before I began to cry like a baby. No b.s. here, the flood gates opened up the moment I realized that this person was willing to hear me while everyone else meant to love me, talked down to me.   


It does take strength, loads. But trust me, you are strong now, and will show that strength, when you take action. Who is to say your parents will not hear of this, and decide its real? The best we can do is be honest in this life, whether people will respect that is on them. Just be honest with them, and most of all, with yourself.

What you describe sounds very familiar to me. You mentioned the memory issues, yeah that I have always had issues with.

zelig_van_d,,,,[],,,,text,t2_3ushrn6d,"Believe me, you're not the first person to feel like this and you won't be the last. I understand the despair you're dealing with, I've been there myself. So as cliché as it sounds, I can promise it does get better. It's very difficult to realise that there is light at the end of the tunnel when you're in the fucking tunnel, but there is. Everything in life is ephemeral, it's all brief in the grand scheme of things and it does end. That includes illness and despair. It can be easy and even kind of comforting to believe that there's no hope and dying is better. But there's a lot more to life than just suffering. 

**When you've hit rock bottom, it's essential to pay attention to the small things.** Eating properly, showering, getting out of bed, etc, are all significant victories when you're on your last legs. 

Below, I've listed out some basic things which people underestimate and can dramatically improve your mood and general health, especially when in the situation you are.

1. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, drugs and smoking. They can offer temporary relief, but also depress your mood and damage your health, they can be catastrophic in the mid-long term. 
2. Eat a healthy diet. Your financial situation and anorexia will affect this, and I understand that. Your financial situation especially is a factor that cannot be fixed, so we need to work around it. This isn't a biology class, so I'll recommend some foods and diet ideas and if you're interested, I'll go into the details about how these things help you in point 3, because I do believe once you know what you're working with, you can actively help yourself. So try to eat fish, whole grains, bananas, chicken, pasta, eggs, low-fat cheese and low-fat yogurt, beans and green vegetables. And for the love of God, **drink lots of water.** 
3. *Okay I promised in point 2 I'd go over the details of what this food does to improve your mood, so if you're not interested, move on to point 4.* Whole grains improve mood because they give your body high levels of carbohydrates. This increases serotonin production, improving mood. Fish has very high levels of omega-3, fatty acids and selenium - all of which increase serotonin production.  Tryptophan, a chemical which also increases serotonin production, is found in all protein-rich foods, such as chicken. However, you should also consume tryptophan-rich foods with carbohydrates, because of other complicating factors which I'm not getting into here. You also want to consume folic acid, found in a variety of beans, green vegetables and even orange juice. 
4. **I cannot stress how important it is to sleep properly.** If I went through sleep thoroughly, I'd end up writing a book on neuroscience here. Sleep is essential to virtually everything we need to function and perform, but in your case, it will dramatically improve mood stabilisation, appetite, energy levels, reduce anxiety and generally improve health and functioning. Try to sleep without the aid of sleeping pills, as (once again, extremely complex topic I'm not getting into) they disrupt the quality of your sleep a lot. Try to avoid any artificial light such as laptop, phone or TV screens about an hour before sleep. Also practise something that calms you down, such as reading, drawing or listening to music. Do this consistently. This will help your body form a rhythm and it will detect the ritual every night and automatically prepare itself for sleep, making it easier to sleep and giving higher quality sleep. 
5. **Drink some more water.**
6. **Attempt to exercise every day, even if it's just a 10 minute walk, exercise is extremely beneficial.** I'll go into some particulars here for the same reason I did with food. Exercise is among the biggest favours you can do yourself, especially when mentally ill. Exercise will not only provide a task you can focus on, accomplishing it also gives you a victory at the end. Exercise will produce serotonin and endorphins in your brain, both of which can relieve stress and improve your mood. In addition, exercise helps you in a variety of physical, emotional and cognitive ways. Try to aim for relaxing exercise, such as walking, but if you feel up to it, try more intensive exercise, like running, cycling or going to the gym. 
7. **Keep up to speed on sanitation.** Make a priority of showering, brushing your teeth, washing your hair, washing your hands, wearing freshly-washed clothes, etc. Sanitation is important to physical health (being physically unhealthy can harm psychological health) and being clean, looking good, improves self-esteem, self-image, confidence and mood. 
8. **Mindfulness is highly beneficial for emotional well-being. Practise it.** Meditating for even 5 minutes every day, journaling, taking peaceful walks. These are all amazing for mental well-being. I'd also encourage you to take up drawing, painting or writing. They all give you something to focus on, help develop goal-oriented behaviour and give an outlet for expression and catharsis. Meditation can be boring at first, but if you can push through that initial boredom, the benefits are immeasurable. As for journaling - always journal with a goal in mind. Don't do it arbitrarily. Use it to reflect. Write about a particular idea and be as honest as possible with yourself. 
9. **Drink even more water.**
10. **Socialise, socialise, socialise.** Social interaction is essential in maintaining physical and mental health, but especially mental. Speaking with people is a powerful tool in improving mood and reducing stress. Like I did with food, I'll get into the science in part 11, if you're interested. Try joining clubs, societies, go out more often with friends, ring up an old friend. Anything that involves social interaction and offers opportunities to meet new people. Socialising will make you feel less lonely, more secure and if you have a support network, that'll go a long way to improving mood and coping ability. Socialising releases a chemical called oxytocin, which activates your parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for calming you down. This helps you reduce anxiety, stress and improve mood. Feeling wanted also improves confidence and self-esteem. So go out, say hello to random people on the street, give cashiers simple comments about the weather, talk to neighbours a little more. Any and all social interaction will help build your confidence, self-esteem and release all those feel-good chemicals. 

That's all I have for you, for now. I could get way more technical and offer more advanced techniques, but I'd only do that if I thought it'd really help you or if you were interested. Feel free to DM me at any time, don't be shy, you won't inconvenience me. And if you have any more questions, want to talk or anything like that, I'm all ears. 

I wish you all the best, and remember, everything passes, including illness.

emwee06,,,,[],,,,text,t2_hpww1,"You're outside perspective - fully outside, not fellow whiner - is very appreciated. I actually took a screenshot and sent it to my husband. 

I'm a huge fan of studying the Myers-Briggs personality types and adjusting how I act around people accordingly. I seem to soak up the emotions and feelings of anyone I'm around, furbabies included. I was a career server/bartender before taking over my SAHM position and, let me tell you.. I would be emotionally exhausted after my shifts. The alone time was for everyone's sake, not just my own. My husband is literally exact opposite of me in all four categories of the MB typing. He is black and white. Wrong or right. No grey area in opinions or discussions. While I have enough empathy for both of us, he lacks the ability to think about anyone elses shoes, much less put himself in them. I have walked him through things with examples from his own life to compare and he will follow me until it clicks - but doing this on his own is just not a skill he has. Ask him what 30% of a crazy high number is and he'll pop it out before you get your phone out of your pocket - but humans are nothing like numbers. 

So in his mind, since he doesn't notice how much just living in a home creates a mess and he damn sure isn't paying attention when leaving for work, he comes home to the same clean house every day. It's no different than it was yesterday, so therefore you didn't do shit. God forbid I spend an entire day in my art studio and neglect the daily chores.. because then I REALLY didn't do shit all day. The art I created or crafts I made to sell don't count because he's too irritated to even care to see them. I know this *sounds* terrible, but it's just the way his brain functions. It doesn't help that he's the only child of a narcissistic single mother who worked swing shift. If she wasn't so ignorant and spiteful and selfish I'd cut her some slack for doing what she had to in order to make money - but after a decade I'm convinced she just wanted no part of the humdrum part of parenting. Left that to family and eventually to my SO himself when he was old enough to get himself up, dressed, and on the bus. 

As for my fur-twins.. I really wish I could find a way to explain this simply.   My boxer is 4. He is smart as sh*t, but very odd. Friends blame it on him being inbred; I just think he's awesome. Cat is 5mos old and came from the same family that boxer did. I got her because boxer needed a bud (older two pups never leave each other's side and bully him). They are yen and yang for each other. If Boxer is having backyard play time cat is in the window spectating, waiting patiently. They do their zoomies in the mornings after SO and kid are gone, and at night after SO and kid are upstairs. I only feed cat little amounts at a time. She is fed in my bathroom, so I sit on my bed until she finishes. Boxer is fed in the kitchen and eats only if I'm in there, so typically when I'm cooking I'll feed him. 

We have a HUGE laundry room that has a door to the backyard and that's where my elderly pups stay, going in and out as they please. We moved here 5 years ago and they have just never really enjoyed being in the living part of this house. The huge fenced in yard with no runners, a whole room with their own couch and doggie door, and each other is all they wanted. Hince why I sit outside with them every day, even when it's freezing. They still need Mommy. Mommy knows what bark means what and what time things like food and play happens. They also LOVE to act like the cat is a threat when she's perched in a window. She discovered our basement bathroom window that is ground level and visible from the back yard. She'll sit there until I get tired of hearing it and lock them inside, only to then go sprawl and cry in front of the door to their ""room"". They've all met. Dogs are all bark, no bite when it comes to cat. They just stare and then waltz off uninterested. 

Back to my twins... I support crate training 100%. It just won't work with these two. The number of times I've zoned out letting the cat eat to suddenly be snapped back by the scritches of boxer toenails trying to sneak by me is astronomically high. Cat will even come back and cuddle me - I think in an attempted distraction. If I stop the dog then the cat will finish the few gobbles of food she left for him..   cat can get on counter in kitchen and will steal food and jump down only to take it to Boxer, not eating any of it. 

I know it sounds like I'm making this up, but I promise  not. It's a daily sitcom and I laugh my ass off all day long, but it gets annoying on those nights where the humans are all tired and in a grumpy mood. I don't get to be tired or in a grumpy mood or just plop down and say ""F-it."" Most of the things I'm doing in the evening hours can ONLY be done in the evening hours - I can't do them earlier to give more time for family. 

...and on to that note. Keep in mind that for most of my kids life it was just us at night. Dinner, bath, conversation, then watch a show together before lights out. I try to include Dad in these things now but it's just not working. Dad doesn't like sitting on the tile floor of the bathroom playing games during bath time. Son doesn't accept Dad watching a show before lights out, he will literally keep himself awake until I can watch something and then falls asleep before the episode is over. 

I am FAR from perfect. Schedules are hard to change. I tried hard to accommodate everyone ELSE before realizing my mood had a lot to do with the vibe of the house, and some alone time to look forward to raises my spirits. 

It's honestly not my fault SO can't help with furbabies or our child.. try harder or shut up and give me my 45 minutes. That's harsh, but life ain't always a cake walk.

ali_soluri,,,,[],,,,text,t2_53dkddq8,"Aw girl- listen. I’m a 31 year old female that’s fighting my own mental health issues. I used to teach art at a high school and became one of the few adults many students could come to with feelings similar to what you’re describing. Now I am not a licensed therapist or doctor so I cannot diagnose you whatsoever but I have a lot of life experience and some insight for you. 
If you’ve been feeling this way for over 2 weeks than you very well might have clinical depression- which may be situational (stemming from a traumatic experience) or biological depression (you’re brain just doesn’t balance chemicals the same as “happy” people) or both. Here are the things that you must know: 
1) Having a mental health disorder is nothing to be ashamed of... our brains are organs and sometimes they need help working better just like if you had a lung disease or other health issue. 
2) You’re not doomed. There’s a lot of great resources available for you to consider in order to figure out what’s going on, why and how to get the correct treatment. 
3) Your mom needs to understand that you may be experiencing a serious health issue- one that can quickly evolve into more serious issues and needs immediate attention. What if you had all the symptoms of cancer and were suffering... would she deny you get treatment for that? If not, she should not deny your concerns about you state of mind. 
4) If you have depression or something else, it’s not a life sentence of misery. You can live a normal, wonderful life if you take care of yourself and understand that you just need the proper care to overcome something that you are not guilty of getting. 
5) in your post, I saw several bits of hope that show you want to feel better and would be open to getting help if given the chance. That’s HUGE. The first and hardest step to surviving any mental health issue is to be proactive in finding the right help. 
Finally-Self medicating and denying there is something wrong are the worst things you can do- they’ll only enhance your pain and problems- trust me- I’m a recovered addict and have reached remission for severe depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD and panic disorder. I live a normal life and have received great success in higher education and am currently working to get my research on how art making and the creative process is a major benefit for people with mental illness, social issues (bullying) and medical issues. I’ve seen the darkest of dark and know that as unfair as it is to be burdened with this mental issue(s) you seem to be experiencing, you have two choices. You can wallow in the pain and try everything under the sun to cover it up for feel a brief relief from the pain OR you can fight for your life. Fight for your future self. Fight to be someone who doesn’t let this define you. The second choice is harder I’ll be honest but your reward will be a life you’re proud of- and feel genuine happiness. Don’t let anyone downplay your emotional state right now. Don’t apologize for your feelings. Find a professional and do the work necessary to get on the road to getting your life back. You deserve happiness and peace. You are not alone and can feel better if you really seek out the proper help. If you need more advice or guidance I’d be happy to help you as much as I can. I wrote all this for you to know that someone (a complete stranger) understands you and cares.

Penetrative,,,,[],,,,text,t2_12tg6w,"Its a tricky thing to outline, its not black &amp; white, there is a fairly thick gray area...  Some people describe depressive episodes.  Depression can be situational.  A major life change or event can trigger a depressive episode that is worthy of treatment.  But a person can learn to cope and acclimate and get off medical treatment and thrive where they once were crippled.  Does that mean they are cured?  Or simply self treating?  Its a fuzzy area...Its not all due to a faulty brain/chemical imbalance.  Some people are legitimately depressed bc their life sucks.  When the situation is alleviated the depression dissolves.  In that time people can be treated.  

I have what some people would call ""functional depression"" which I sought treatment for.  For a long time I tormented myself thinking, ""Im not really depressed bc I still have good hygiene and have some happy days."", I knew I wasn't right, but felt like a wimp for going to the doctor about it because I was functional, I thought depressed people layed in bed and cried all day and I was able to limit my crying to night time so I thought it didn't apply to me- but my doctor explained otherwise.  Depression is much broader than those we think of with ""Major Depression"".  Sort of like autism, its a whole spectrum.  Way back in the day Autism was akin to being severely mentally handicapped, there was no Asperger or anything in between,  now you can't even notice a lot of people on the spectrum bc they are high functioning.   

Being depressed in any capacity doesn't take aways from the struggle of those with major depression.  Im fine with people saying they are cured, it doesn't bother me.  Frankly ive heard diet and exercise can be a helluva treatment and if people think not taking a pill means cured, its none of my business.

Putting diagnosis aside completely, she sounds incredibly distressed, and I'm sure that is taking a huge toll on her well-being and mind.  Someone can't keep living like that - something has to be done.

I think it's critical that you get her to see a psychiatrist as soon as you can.  If she resists, my approach would be to emphasize to her just how unhappy and upset she is, and that there is help out there.  

Obviously it's best if you can find one and schedule an appointment so there isn't a lot of drama.  

If she really seems to be going off the rails and might harm herself or others, or just in general put herself into a dangerous situation, you should take her to the ER.  Frankly, if she 's already saying there are people in her head and body, I would say she is already in considerable danger, for example because she may not be able to cross a street safely, etc.

If she refuses to go to the ER, I think you may need to call 911.  

911 or an ER visit may result in her being subject to a 72 hour involuntary hold while they start trying to figure out what's going on with her, but that may end up being a really good thing since it will put her own the path to getting the long term help she needs.",,,,,1581041513,,,fgr9mxr,False,t3_f036ck,,True,t3_f036ck,/r/mentalhealth/comments/f036ck/my_gf_is_hallucinating_and_says_that_she_has/fgr9mxr/,,1581044943,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,,,,,,False,{},,[],False,0.0,[],,,False,,,

I realize a couple might not be able to be done actually sitting in class, but maybe before you go to class and/or take exams.  They can take a lot of practise, just doing one or two times won't be enough to work)---------

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations. Breath focus can be especially helpful for people with eating disorders to help them focus on their bodies in a more positive way. However, this technique may not be appropriate for those with health problems that make breathing difficult, such as respiratory ailments or heart failure.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there. A body scan can help boost your awareness of the mind-body connection. If you have had a recent surgery that affects your body image or other difficulties with body image, this technique may be less helpful for you.
3. **Guided imagery.** For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes—just make sure to choose imagery you find soothing and that has personal significance. Guided imagery may help you reinforce a positive vision of yourself, but it can be difficult for those who have intrusive thoughts or find it hard to conjure up mental images.
4. **Mindfulness meditation**. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future. This form of meditation has enjoyed increasing popularity in recent years. Research suggests it may be helpful for people with anxiety, depression, and pain.

Practice doing body checking throughout the day: how do your legs, arms, stomach, chest, everything feel? How is your breathing? Are you breathing from your lungs or your diaphragm? (Practice breathing from your diaphragm instead of your lungs ad that can help calm one down in a state of heightened emotion).

And if you're able to if you haven't already, I would suggest looking into therapy and/or councelling.

In the meantime, look up Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy.

Talk to her. If she married you she probably has some respect for you, even after everything. Maybe don't talk to her about everything (yet), but explain what's on your mind and why you need help, maybe why/how your sex drive went down.

About that specific subject, other medicines can help counterbalance the reduced libido anti-depressants tend to impose. 

Go talk to a psy. They probably are the most qualified down here. If you already take meds I guess you already see someone, but this someone probably knows a specialist around relationships issues.

And most importantly, think about yourself. Low self-esteem can be a bitch and you need to remember that as a person, you ARE NOT as shitty as you think.

Charities like MIND and The Recovery College are a great place to collate all kinds of services and resources for more specialised needs and local groups

It was once explained to me that there is a sort of pyramid of mental health support, starting at the base with zero need.

Level 1 is GP who in all likelihood will listen and decide if you should be referred to other service providers or if they can handle it with you; also prescribe medication if they feel it helpful or on advice from other services

2 is talking therapies, phone and in person assessments and appointments etc.

3 are your community mental health teams, child and adolescent mental health teams etc who have 24hr support and crisis services and their own prescription and dispensaries and stuff

Then there are all the private sector practices and charities that exist outside this little NHS - organised system who deal with various issues such as substance misuse, domestic and sexual abuse survivors, gender and sexual minorities etc.",,,,,1581030878,,,fgqt1oi,False,t3_f001wc,,True,t3_f001wc,/r/mentalhealth/comments/f001wc/not_at_all_coping/fgqt1oi/,,1581035111,2,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,,,,,,False,{},,[],False,0.0,[],,,False,,,

Normally I wouldn't recommend pandering too much but this is a scary time for everyone trying to push people out of their comfort zone at the moment seems unnecessary.


Also try to understand their particular fear. Some people are scared they'll get it some are more worried for their loved ones. Getting an idea means you can avoid saying triggering things.

Stay factual about things. Don't let people spiral into what ifs especially if they're unlikely. Let them know whatever happens you'll be there.

cosmiicsloth,,,,[],,,,text,t2_2umepxl4,"First off: please don't think that attaining your image of a ""perfect body"" will mean your life will be perfect and you will be happy. I'm sorry to break it to you, but that won't happen. By the sound of this you have body dysmorphia and you will never achieve the ""perfect"" body. As people we're always seeking flaws in ourselves and by default, we're not perfect. It sounds cliché but you have to embrace it.

Here's an anecdote: a few years ago I had the ""perfect body."" Was I happy? No. I was lonely and sad. I was starving. I was straining myself to ""be perfect"" and eventually, it made me utterly miserable. In fact, I don't think I even noticed I already had a great, fit body, because I kept focusing on everything I thought was wrong.

As you said in the beginning of your post, you're skinny - or normal. Don't think of it as you having to change. What you should strive towards is mental and physical wellbeing - your body has nothing to do with this as long as it's healthy. Sure, you will gain muscle, might lose fat and look more toned once you start eating balanced and exercising, but that shouldn't be your focus. Appearance is such a superficial value, it won't take you anywhere. When you focus on enjoying life, these things become subsidiary.

Now, I think your family plays a big role in your self-image. It sounds almost abusive - you really need to either talk with them about their habits and how they treat you, or if that wouldn't work out, contact a social worker or other professional. It's not right to treat your own child like that.

ha. I'm in therapy right now for this same thing. I started therapy to address an issue in my marriage, and realized that there was some involuntary emotional responses happening due to who knows what in my past... she is now suggesting I go through EMDR therapy.

But if you think you're interested in trying medication - get hooked up with a psychiatrist. Your insurance should cover that I would think as they're a medical doctor? They usually don't do much ""talking"" like in therapy, but they will be able to give you options as to what medication might match up with your symptoms. If you find something that works, you only need to check in with them every 6 months or a year, so less expensive than weekly therapy potentially. You *do not* have to be suicidal/manic-depressive/a danger to yourself or the world to go on meds. You just need to have altered brain chemistry - there are tons of low-dose, relatively safe anti-depressants for people who just want to find their ""normal"" again.

I had a PIP home assessment in November last year. Claiming on the grounds of my depression, anxiety and agoraphobia. The assessor was really nice on the day. A few weeks later, I receive a letter saying that I received 0 points also.

1st lie, The assessor said that I walk my dog -nope, that wasn’t even asked on the day, she knew I had a dog as she was barking when the door went.

2nd lie, I take my kids to the park - again, nope. Where this lie came from I don’t know, wasn’t part of the question list.

3rd lie, I was well presented - nope, I was in pyjamas, hadn’t shaved or had a haircut in almost 2 months and hadn’t showered in almost a week.

And the 4th, which really annoyed me. I was welcoming. Like wtf? I feel like that was more a punishment for being raised correctly. 

These people don’t care and have no clue about mental health, citizens advice bureau got really pissed off with this and have since told me that they will be present at all future home assessments if I decide to reapply, which I will when I’m mentally prepared for it. 

It’s disgusting in this country, we try to get some help and end up feeling worse.

dunno260,1272578458.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_413ri,"Depression causes a lot of memory and concentration problems on its own.  It's sort of an underreported symptom of depression, but it's there for a lot.  It's just that other symptoms sort of come to the forefront.

I have similarish issues with interests.  I do have mild ADHD though.  One hallmark of ADHD though is the ability to hyperfocus on some activities (for some).  ADHD isn't the inability to pay attention to anything, it's the inability to sufficiently focus on prioritized tasks. 

 For instance with myself, give me a coloring book or dishes to wash, and I can go forever doing those activities with total focus.  I don't particularly enjoy the activities, but those are two things I noticed I get absorbed in.  In contrast give me a test in a subject matter I love and I am going to zone out at times.

The other thing the depression is probably giving you is low frustration tolerance (so the subject gets a little more challenging as you move in and you bail quickly) and lessened fulfillment from goal accomplishment.  During the first few weeks everything is new and novel and exciting and then that sort of tapers off and for you there isn't anything sort of left to provide the needed drive.

For me, the best remedy, and it's imperfect, is to when possible connect something like going to class as an action needed to get something deep that I know I really want or need.  I really struggled with really bad depression in college, but I got by because I could motivate myself enough to pass some classes I didn't like because I knew the degree was something I had to have for whatever was next in my life.  My GPA was terrible, far far worse than I am capable of, but I did graduate.

Contrast that with graduate school (long story about getting in with a bad GPA) which I did on pure interest.  I did great at first in grad school.  Loved what I studied, but hated research which is what I wanted to do in the subject.  I ended up leaving because the degree was meaningless to me once what I wanted it for wasn't something I wanted anymore.  And the lack of that degree has not hurt me and I don't regret not having it.

So maybe that helps and provides some insight, maybe not.  It's something I really struggle with as well and haven't found much to fight it with.

The condition you're describing sounds a lot like Emetophobia - the fear of vomiting or seeing vomit. This is an unfortuantely common condition - usually it comes about due to one bad incident, but it can seemingly come from nowhere as well. You can read up a bit more about it here: [https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/anxiety-type/emetophobia/](https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/anxiety-type/emetophobia/)

The difficult thing with panic attacks is that they tend to 'spread out' - it might affect one particular situation, but then start affecting other related ones. For some people this can lead to a fear of leaving their house at all. 

My advice would be to seek a therapist. If you're in the UK your GP can refer you to the local IAPT service (free on the NHS) who offer therapy for specific phobias like emetophobia.",True,,,0.0,1530184789,,0.0,e1fl2nf,False,t3_8ugwck,1.0,True,t3_8ugwck,/r/mentalhealth/comments/8ugwck/fear/e1fl2nf/,17143.0,1533019665,2,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,public,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,richtext,
Stuck-in-a-Cycle,1506788892.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_28iugh,"You seem like a very compassionate person, helping others despite having your own baggage. However you also deserve compassion! And it can come from yourself. I know many people hear things like ""you have to learn to love yourself"" and snort or think of it as narcissism, but it is anything but. To love yourself is to accept that you are flawed, imperfect but deserving of happiness and friendship regardless :)

I can recommend Meditation and Mindfulness. Start simple, get into a comfortable position and pay attention to your breath, count each breath 1 to 10 as you inhale and exhale. Your mind WILL wander. That's perfectly okay. Just start counting again from 1. It's important that you don't think of yourself as a bad meditator for having wandering thoughts, even the most experienced meditators have this as well! The purpose of meditation is to give our mind some rest, and eventually to observe and understand ourselves, as well as learn to love ourselves and others. You don't need to be a buddhist or even follow buddhist philosphy at all to meditate or experience it's scientifically backed benefits (https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/just-8-weeks-of-meditation-can-change-your-brain-for-the-better-science-shows.html)

TheHeartOfBattle,1332079507.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_779jn,"Personally? I would say that's a perfectly understandable coping mechanism.

As a therapist the warning signs I'd usually look out for are: identifying voices or characters as external rather than internal, voices expressing sentiments that cause distress, or visual hallucinations of characters.

From the sounds of it this is just your own coping mechanism for your past trauma, and it's something that's actually helping you quite a lot at the moment. You've taken these positive role models on board very strongly.

My only advice would be A) don't let your real life friendships suffer in favour of imaginary ones; although they're comforting, you don't want to rely on them exclusively. B) Make sure that you do engage with your therapy and be honest with your therapist. The therapist is not there to force you to change, and as long as you're very clear on the nature of your imaginary friends (not auditory or visual hallucinations, not identifying them as real people, not stating that they're telling you to do things, not replacing your real friendships) then I don't imagine they'll have a problem with it.

That being said I'm speaking from the perspective of a CBT therapist - while I assess a wide range of mental illnesses, I wouldn't necessarily be the one delivering therapy to someone in your situation, so another type of therapist might have a different opinion.

I think we underestimate how much emotions impact ED. We seem to have this (false) belief able it men that they should always be able and ready to have sex, when that is far from the truth. Although I obviously don’t know you and your situation details, it’s possible that you’re having trouble because she means a lot to you. In other words, the sex is harder because it means a lot to you, which puts pressure on you. It seems to me like one possible way to move forward would be to try and take the pressure of performance out of the situation. There are many ways to do this but here are some ideas. 

1) schedule time to be physically intimate within established confines. For example, “Tuesday night we will spend some time in bed in our underwear, touching, kissing, massaging, but we aren’t allowed to take our underwear off and this will not end in sex.”

2) talk to her about needing to take breaks during sex. This would mean that you set aside a decent amount of time for sex and it isn’t rushed. Let’s say you’re in the heat of the moment and notice you’re losing your erection. Tell her you need to slow down. Lie down together, go back to slow kissing and cuddling, take deep breaths. When you’re relaxed you might notice your erection comes back and you can ease yourself back into sex. 

Basically what I’m saying is to try and tell her that you’re having a hard time BECAUSE she matters and you’re nervous. Have intimate experiences with one another with less pressure, and more time. Give yourself opportunities to experience intimacy with positive outcomes and associations, and set realistic expectations.

Usually I just help others to achieve their goals, and watch them grow. That is way easier for me instead of caring for myself and it makes me really happy, yet it is immensely rewarding if people come back to me for it. I don't take these things for granted. Even little signs of appreciation keep me happy for days or weeks. But it's never the money, or friends, or family, or lovers, that can replace the feeling of being aimless. It is insanely hard, when you started to hold yourself back at one point in your life and learned too late how to cope with hard, emotional situations. It spirals you always down to that unsolved thing. Therapy helps. But there's one thing you have to do to break the cycle: to accept your new self and stop seeing only your familiar, overwhelming, negative position in life. I try. But I fall back, again and again. I specifically don't say that I have depression, I only have moments of weakness, of being scared, of having a depressive episode, to win against it. Still don't know what the fuck I should do.

Fear of reaching out to others, fear of being open with others.

Jumpy and on my guard all the time, especially when around people who (for various or sometimes no reasons) remind me of past bullies (family, old ‘friends’, and stereotypical school bullies).

Fear of working anywhere that I might run into anyone that I know from any point in my life.

Can’t handle causing people to have any sort of bad emotion, because then they might be negative towards me, and I can’t handle that because of the past bullying and stuff.

A friend of mine, we'll call him X, suffered a panic attack after believing his uncle and a friend of his, who do not even know of each others' existence, were conspiring against him to ruin his professional and social lives. He was admitted to a mental health clinic where he told me he was being abused. I looked into the facility and indeed, other people have had similar experiences and the facility itself has a score of 2.4 on google reviews. A mutual friend of ours, we'll call him Y, reached out to me and told me that X has been considering suicide and is not in a good place right now. I am trying to facilitate a meeting between Y, X's mother, and myself to try and get him to go to a good mental health clinic. I'm trying to do this ASAP because X is clearly a danger to himself right now.

My question is, how do I approach this issue with X? How can I convince him that despite this previous experience with an abusive health clinic that he ought to go to this place for help? How do I get him to recognize he has an issue at all? Of course I want to be as positive, supporting, and helpful as possible, but my fear is he will be unwilling to seek any professional help after his last experience?

When a good friend of mine started therapy she changed three times until she found a therapist who was perfect for her. 

I know you do not want to change therapist but I do not really see another way. The therapist will not change his ways and you do not feel safe in his presence. 

Do you think that you will get healthier and can cope better with your problem with his help? If the answer is no than you have to change therapist.

Altitudinous-Ozark,1501808305.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_9bi85a2,"'blame' is a problematic framing.

Speaking personally, 'blaming;' my parents for xyz that they did or didnt do was, for many years, a dead end. Reason being, all of that history is written and the fact remains that I have to live my life every day and do the best with what Ive got. Cant change the past. No point going back there and assigning blame on them even though they did shit that hurt me. Spending precious energy on who's 'fault' it was is disempowering and debilitating, so I made a choice not to do it.

Some relationships can be toxic and there are relationships that need to be managed so that the toxicity doesnt do harm. I try not to 'blame' the other person, because to do that denies my own part in the relationship, and my own makeup, which is unique to me (as it is to all people in all relationships)  as contributing factors. The relationship is the issue, not 'them' and not 'me'.

I mean, and Im not saying its easy, the best way with any person who has caused personal harm harm is to forgive them. Thats proportionately difficult to the degree of harm they have caused, but the thing is, carrying around resentment for what they have done is a heavy burden in itself, and can have a very negative cumulative effect on a person over time.

It isn't just damage you fight with depression but neuro-plasticity.  Neurons that fire together wire together.  The more you think about something, the stronger that pathway gets.  It's not permanent of course.  As an example a baseball pitcher would be highly skilled at arm movement, but doesn't mean that when they shoot a basketball they will throw it like a baseball.  It does mean though it will be hard to say alter their arm angle from the way they have always done it (but athletes are able to do that as well).

The reality is you don't know what the future brings.  Yes, treatment might be futile and you will be depressed forever regardless of what you do, or that isn't true in some shape and form.

Sounds like a dismissal to me, pardon my misinterpretation and thank you for the clarification.  I appreciate the resource that you provided, but would point out that it does not refute a role for neurochemical causation of mood disorders.  If the drugs truly only target one neurotransmitter release cycle (please forgive my layman's misuse of parlance), and the drug has demonstrated some efficacy, then isn't the simplest solution that there is some relationship - however indirect - between the chemical and the disorder?

It is.  Therapy isn't about explaining the onset of depression.  It's about correcting it.  I was describing the model behind the therapeutic approach to treating depression, not the model used to explain its causes.

&gt;so I'm pretty curious why you dismiss the roles of genetics and environment here.

I didn't.

&gt; I also thought that the numbers for antidepressants were promising (though sub-optimal), am I mistaken?

It depends on the study and the drug in question but the short answer is many perform better than placebo.

&gt; If not, how does that fit into your view of depression vis-a-vis ""chemical imbalance""?

Because antidepressants don't work by correcting chemical imbalances. That is a marketing claim that was never congruent with research on the subject.  For a really good discussion of that issue see [here](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392).

Depression is not a ""chemical imbalance"" and it's not a problem with your sentential reasoning skills.

The only way to change that is to slowly forge new pathways through troubleshooting, practice, perseverence and discipline.  A properly trained and educated psychologist will work with you to make the changes in your life that are required to build up and favor new, adaptive pathways and abandon the maladaptive ones.

Ginger_Lord,1384830648.0,,,,,,,,t2_dz85j,"Not a mental health professional, but I know a few.  I've also been depressed, and what you're laying down sounds a hell of a lot like that to me, have you considered that?  If I were you, I'd definitely head into therapy asap.

&gt;People say I can still enjoy life + be happy + be successful despite life being unfair (even though I might have to work a little harder), people say I am better off than many people in this world, people say a challenging life is more fun

This is the kind of well-intentioned, ill-informed input that people who care about you but don't understand what you're going through tend to say.  I've been on both sides of that one, usually the sayer TBH but I'm still learning!  If your therapist says shit like this, then they are a bad therapist and you need to find another one.  If this is the kind of input you expect from a mental health professional, then you will likely find yourself re-evaluating your opinion on the profession shortly after involving yourself in it.  Most therapists (that I know of, anyway) don't see themselves as there to tell you how it is, but there to help you find out and hook you up with resources that you can use to cope with what you discover.

&gt; A) I know what I'm sad about and I know what would make me happy but I don't know why I'm sad which I feel is information they really need and I don't have, and B) I'm not too sure what they could possibly do.

You're 22 and if you are fortunate enough to see another decade you may come to agree with me that what makes a person happy tends to evolve, mutate, and suddenly apparate over time.  If the work that these people did was easy, then we wouldn't have a massive and growing profession dedicated to resolving this sort of issue.  What can a therapist (not necessarily a psychologist but that's a nitpick) do for you?  They can help you to sort this stuff out.  It's what they do for a living, and these sorts of things take time and effort to sort out.  You may need to see multiple professionals... maybe one sort of therapy is unhelpful, maybe you need a psychiatrist, maybe you do well in a group setting etc.  Lots of potential causes for your strife, and for each cause there are a dozen potential solutions.  It's much better to have help navigating that, wouldn't you agree? :) ",True,,,0.0,1521134162,,0.0,dvqzhpz,False,t3_84nrqq,1.0,True,t3_84nrqq,/r/mentalhealth/comments/84nrqq/what_can_a_psychologist_do_to_help_me/dvqzhpz/,2943.0,1525196353,0,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,public,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is easy to feel scared and helpless. But think of your anxiety more like overcoming a challenge. Reward yourself for everytime you overcome it and don't be to hard on yourself if at times you have to surrender to it. We all have to at times.

Only a psychiatrist / doctor can prescribe meds. Ask around if anyone knows a compassionate psyc / doc. You don’t have to mention that it’s for mental health / for you. 

So would recommend seeing a psychiatrist / doctor and getting proper treatment (right form of therapy for you / right meds / possible exercise passes).

narcissusgoldmund,,,,,,,,,,"Others with more expertise on that test may have more to say, but from my limited knowledge it *is* in one way, I think, in that it involves the use of a visual aid to help the person receiving therapy say more about their thoughts and feelings. When I use TA, I find diagrams of the personality model involved (popularly known as the PAC model) and its associated techniques useful in helping clients understand the model and apply it to themselves.

That aside, the main benefit for me is how it allows people in therapy to get closer to comprehending *why* they think, feel and behave as they do, and it allows this to be done in a systematic and precise way. For example, have you ever indulged in behaviour that you *know* to be wrong, but keep doing it anyway and are mystified as to why you do? Have you ever been in a relationship with a person where you both indulge in repeated, damaging behaviour, and neither of you know why you seem to be stuck in groundhog day when you both want to stop? TA attempts to help us see why we might do both of these, and what the underlying reasons are, so that we can change in the future.

It's worth saying here that TA certainly isn't a magic bullet: it can be successful, but like any worthwhile therapeutic process it takes hard work, and a willingness on the part of the client to both change and be challenged. That said, I've used it myself with clients that feared they could never change, and have see very positive results.

So, if you think it might work for you don't just take my word for it, but do some more research. There are plenty of resources out there for you to digest; I've produced some YouTube videos for my clients explaining basic TA concepts, for instance. I'm wary of spamming this sub, though, so I won't post them here but I'd be happy to PM you a link, with your permission, of course.

To close, I'd suggest finding out about the different aspects of TA and see whether you think it might fit: not everyone likes the idea of such an analytical approach, but it might be just what you're looking for. If it is, that's great, but if it isn't... there are other therapeutic approaches out there.

I have stacks of journals from highschool but recently i havent been filling them as often, feels like i have nothing to put in them anymore, like my creative soul is dead and theres nothing driving me to express in those little ways.

 I recently started Wellbutrim for my Depression and feel no different yet so maybe my psych will up my dose and that will change something. As for diet, when i do actually eat I try to eat healthy but that's probably counteracted by how little i eat and my lack of exercise. 

basquiat is obviously a rare and ideal example and it wasna different time, living in NYC was really cheap. he's still a major inspiration to me and if i could would drop everything and move to NY too. I have insta but im not active cause social media feels so terrible for my mental health, FB and insta specifically, but i see the value in personal branding and marketing oneself. I just dont knoe how to not be cringy about it and to not be on those platforms without constantly feeling insecure comparing my life to my peers. but thats another post. 
PM me ur business, id love to support :]

 How close are you to your brother? And are you younger or older than him? I've been on the other side of this situation (sort of as your brother, I don't have schizophrenia but similar problems with my parents and mental illness). 

Are your parents the one isolating him or himself? I agree he definitely needs to see a specialist. If you have no idea where to go and live in the US, you could try calling 211. Especially if you're that scared your brother might hurt himself. They will send a professional to your house and then can set him up with a therapist or program to help him. They're very in depth and I believe this would be a good option for him as he's currently getting no help and he really needs it. The only issue I guess is not enough detail. Do you have health insurance? Even if you're still under your parent's health insurance, you can still get help without them knowing if they refuse to let you use the insurance to help him. 

Stay strong friend. Please update me and I'm sorry I can't provide many resources right now, hopefully someone else might have others.

What are your creative pursuits? I'd love to help you get started or at least motivate you that it's possible.... Can you start working on them in small steps while keeping your job for now? 

I would not recommend dropping everything and moving. You'll find quickly how hard it is to find anything, and even with money saved, if you aren't making any more income then it'll only last so long. So.. Keep planning. Start working on your creative ideas more; if you have a good idea, write it down in a notebook and commit yourself a little time to work on it each week. Nothing will happen in a day. 

I'm currently attempting to start a small online business with a couple friends, so I'm trying to figure out a balance too. Medication (vyvanse) has helped me a lot to get through my work day and actually be productive, it also gives me energy and I don't feel as depressed on it. If you don't want to try meds, even more coffee or a healthy diet could raise your energy enough that you can still work on side projects without just dying after work, lol.

I picked how my life would look like and just fantasized a lot about it. And that kept me going personally. I had made myself a goal in life. I wanted to keep living for ME, not for others. I used to think I was useless to everyone and that nobody liked me. But once you try to think about yourself and your own wellbeing, you can slowly change your mindset. I was depressed and suicidal from age 12 until age 17 I think. Well the depression lasted a bit longer (age 10 until 19). I'm 23 now and in my final year of social work studies.

One strategy is to break it down into tiny chunks. So instead, don't say, ""I'm not going to be negative today,"" say something smaller and more specific like:

 ""The next time I make a mistake and start thinking it's the worst thing ever, I'm going to challenge that thinking. Is it really the worst thing ever? What other mistakes have I survived that have been worse? Did other people actually notice the mistake or are they too focused on their own lives?"" And so on. 

You can even make it smaller and more specific, like focusing on one interaction with a specific person. If you have negative thoughts when you interact with a coworker or classmate (""they think I'm stupid,"" or ""they hate me,"" or ""they're thinking I'm incompetent."") work to identify those thoughts and argue against them.

TXTulip210,1502738057.0,,,,,,,,t2_1jb6u9l,"I've been lurking on Reddit for years now and have never commented on anything - EVER, but I want you to know you're not alone and you're not crazy even though panic attacks sometimes make you think you are. (At least mine do)

I have generalized anxiety disorder and at one point had panic attacks 5 or 6 times a day. For many years doctors tried to treat it as just depression. They said I was just sad and getting myself worked up over nothing. That really did not work. In fact it made it worse. It was very discouraging seeking help and not seeing improvements. 

It took me going through multiple doctors until I found one that would truly listen. She saw that that what I had going on was so much more than depression. I am on an antidepressant still but what makes the difference for me is how she treats my anxiety. On a daily basis I take a medication for high blood pressure (propranolol) Now I don't have heart issues but it does control that racing heart feeling that I get at the beginning of a panic attack. For the most part that controls my anxiety but in times of extreme stress I do still have panic/anxiety attacks so I do have a medication that stops them (clonazapam) but it makes me very drowsy so I don't take it unless I really need it. The panic attacks are down to one or two a month now and it has really changed my life. 

I'm sorry if it seems I'm rambling, I just want you to know there are options out there and sometimes it takes a long time to find the right doctor for you but it's worth it. YOU are worth it. I know the loss of your job must be distressing - it always is when people don't understand what you are going through, but try not to be hard on yourself. This could be the start of you finding a position that is a better fit for you.  And while you are figuring it all out myself and all Reddit will be here to support you on your journey to health and happiness. Just remember to keep being kind to yourself.

When I finally helped her to start talking, and started to offer the possibility that she could not only identify, but actively work towards a solution to what she is going through, we started talking more. By her own admission, she told me even though she was extremely happy for 2 years with me, and it changed VERY suddenly, she can't bring herself to think about the why, the positives, or the possibility of working through it and back together. 

Unlike her I have learned to recognize and deal with it when I feel like I am struggling with something. By her own admission and the descriptions from her family, she has been systematically cutting out the uncomfortable things in her life since early childhood, and pushing them away rather than dealing with them and processing them. 

She has expressed multiple times that she has failed me, and wasn't good enough for me, and that I deserve better, and she doesn't understand why/how I would ever forgive her. These are classic negativity filters, catastrophisizing, etc.

It's often very difficult to tackle your worries when they're sat in your head - the more you think about them, the more anxious you get, so the harder it is to concentrate, so the more you have to think about them... 

So get them out of your head. Write down, on paper, exactly what you are worrying about. This will often come in the form of a 'what if' thought - ""what if I did something horrible last night?"". 

Take a step back, look at that thought you've written down, and consider if there's anything you can do about it right now. Is there a **real, practical plan** that you can put into place *right now* to sort it out? If so, try and work out what that might be. Again, write down each of the steps, what you'll do, who you'll talk to, and so on.

If there isn't anything you can do about it, try to remind yourself of that. Put that piece of paper aside and try to focus on something else. Watch TV, turn the volume up, and pay attention to exactly what's going on. If you notice your mind drifting again, just tell yourself ""I have acknowledged the worry and I will deal with it when I can."" and bring your attention back.

Bereavement itself is a long and difficult process, and often leads to these feelings of numbness, depression, pain, and so on; the fact that you were a witness to the death and had to try to administer CPR to your own father will only have added to the gigantic impact of that event. 

Usually it takes some time for your brain to process something like that. However, sometimes that process gets ""stuck"" for whatever reason - you were too busy dealing with surrounding circumstances, or you turned to drink or drugs to cope, or other traumatic events happened - and you can't come to terms with the event. 

Your brain is still in shock mode after what it's gone through, and you've never had the chance to sit down and properly deal with it. In a situation like that my first recommendation would be to see a qualified counsellor. They can help you to confront the trauma you experienced, understand why and how it affected you, explore the impact on your life and beliefs, and ultimately to come out of the other side with a degree of closure. 

In the meantime, my only real advice is to take care of yourself. Make sure you keep up with rating, exercise, social activities and so on. Don't be afraid to use the support of people around you.

I don't know him so take what I'm going to say with a grain of salt. Although he does seem like a great guy overall the way he dealed with the christmas invention doesn't seem nice at all. I do think that it is just platonic and he tried to soften the blow of basically telling her he just made other plans but I do think the nicer way would have been to just be honest with her and not make up a story about being stuck on the way to the airport which basically is lying to her. In that case he wouldn't have been expected and he wouldn't have had to dissappoint her and her children. So he lied to keep up his nice guy persona. But that could just be becase I'm a honest and kind of blunt person and like other people to be that way too. Like I said I don't know him and his version of events so I could be totally wrong here.

I basically go through the same thing. I'm not going to say I'm the life of the party but I can get along with anyone. The problem thoughts I have when I go into such a depressive state is that I feel like I'm behind a mask. I feel like the current depression is the mood I should live with all of the time, it makes everything I've done without it feel like it was done without any authentic feeling behind them.

Without going into too much detail about the tension in my current relationship, I think honesty is the best policy. Tell him that you think he should get help. Offer your support however you can in the moments that it happens but don't prod too much.

Depersonalization can consist of a detachment within the self, regarding one's mind or body, or being a detached observer of oneself. Subjects feel they have changed and that the world has become vague, dreamlike, less real, or lacking in significance. It can be a disturbing experience. Chronic depersonalization refers to depersonalization-derealization disorder, which is classified by the DSM-5 as a dissociative disorder.

As to your second point, what we need there is more education that mental illness doesn’t have a look, and that statistically everyone knows someone with a mental illness. We need people to speak up so we can end the stigma, not tone down their stories for others’ comfort. 

It’s also vaguely offensive that you have implied that people who have more severe depression will “exaggerate” it. They are no more likely to do so than anyone else.

You should do this ASAP, because if it comes and goes, it's gonna be difficult to do when you're on a high. Go talk to someone, in the physical,and try work through this.

Think constant grazing like a horse, rather than eating meals all at once like wolves. Have you ever heard that if you eat large meals your stomach will stretch out? The opposite is also true. Your stomach has shrunk to fit the amounts of food you normally eat, and before you can really tackle the psychological part of this, you need to gradually stretch it back to normal.

You will rapidly gain weight at first, because your body is in starvation mode and will respond by stockpiling nutrients into your fat in case you have to go back to starving. And it may be painful and uncomfortable for a while as your body adjusts.

Trust me, you do this, then no one would understand you even further. Physical pain is not comparable to mental pain. And you'll be adding that pain towards yourself a tenfold. Plus, these are school kids you're targeting, it's showing weakness in your character. No one deserves it. No one deserves to be killed indiscriminately. Not even you.

You go to prison and people will only see you as a murderer, no one would actually care about you and would be wishing you either dead or suffering. Either you're executed swiftly or would live trapped with people who you don't know what they've done, and might do to you worse. Or perhaps you'd be sentenced to stay put in the prison room for eternity, never allowed to leave the room. Add torture schedule into this, who know what happens in prison.

And going out after release, if, and while your reputation is crippled beyond repair, it's not worth it. Having said this I might argue being homeless might be better than being imprisoned and criminalized. And I assume you're living in a big world out there? As long as you're able to move around, there's many different opportunities you can get than doing immoral things like this.

You're not alone. Everyone has these fucked up thoughts in their heads but you shouldn't act on them. A lot of people that I've chatted with in the net are experiencing employment problems. Everywhere I go, I'm bound to meet them. So again you're not alone.

Share with us, redditors, others, what mental illness are you going through, tell us your story, where we can both relate, agree, disagree and advise to each other. As of right now I strongly urge you not to act out on what you've just confessed. It's unhealthily selfish, and you'll be framing other people who might have the same mental illness as yours. You might add up more gun crimes/suicides from this. It's not a solution, it's worsening the situation.

There's so much pressure we put on ourselves to do well in school, get good grades, ace exams. But if we're not in a healthy mental state, the pressure turns into an unhealthy pressure, builds and builds, and ends in self-sabotage.

What I've learned is that school can wait, classes can be retaken, but your health and well-being can't. It's fine to take things a little slower when you need to. I was disappointed in myself for a long time, but then I realized that it was what I needed, and that now when I decide to go back to school, I will be in a much better frame of mind to do so. 

I know how hard it is, but try to be easier on yourself. Have grace with yourself. You're not the first to fail an exam, and it is not a reflection of your intelligence or worth as a person.

Campbell090217,1508977219.0,,,,,,,,,"Hi ❤️
I’ve been where you are, and I know you don’t want to hear this, but opening up to your parents may be the best option. I know not everyone has a good relationship with their parents and maybe your parents won’t understand entirely, but just getting it out of your system is so so powerful. 

Also, if you feel like you can have an open conversation with your boss or manager, explain to them that you really enjoy the job and want to succeed, but that you have a lot of self doubt and you aren’t sure if you are performing well enough. Any competent boss should be able to understand that and offers you honest feedback. If they say you are doing a good job, believe them! They have no reason to lie to you. And let them know that if they aren’t happy with your performance, to let you know right away so that you can fix the problem instead of worrying about the “what if’s”. 

Lastly, try not to rule out medication and therapy. I’m sure you’ve heard this but both of those can take a lot of trial and error to find a good fit. It really fucking sucks to try something new and realize it isn’t working, but at least you are able to learn from the situation and adjust the next time you try.

What you need to do:

1) you are entitled to free legal advice. make use of that. See a member of staff and ask who has the ""advocacy contract"", say that you want to speak to a ""mental health advocate"". 

2) Your hospital MUST have a copy of the ""Code of Practice to the Mental Health Act"". Ask to see a copy. Read through it. It's written in fairly easy English.

However, I hope you don't let this ruin your self-esteem/self-worth. First, you know what you did wrong and you feel bad about it and I doubt you'll do it again. Some people don't get that far. 

Second, you say the age difference between you and the girl was at the most, three years. This is a weird moral area... it seems to me that it isn't weird for you to be attracted to someone that age. Like, there's no indication that you have pedophilia tendencies. That doesn't mean you should watch cp, because the porn's production in the first place is wrong. 

This is a very taboo subject and I see why it makes you feel so instantly terrible. It can feel very isolating if you do have harmful sexual tendencies (which I'm not sure is the case for you if this was a one-time thing), but it is possible to get help! I encourage you to see a professional if you have a hard time getting over this or if you keep doing things you regret.

And as electricity stresses them out, they develop coping mechanisms which dont solve the problem, which end up exasperating the stress, and as a result mental illness and suicide are the highest in cities.

I can imagine the prospect of group therapy would be overwhelming for someone who struggles socially. However, bear in mind that group therapy with those on spectrum is generally very structured with the aim of having a safe space to practice those skills which you are lacking. This is something that really can’t be done in the 1:1 therapeutic setting, as there’s no substitute for other people who are also struggling with whom you can practice and learn from. 

Your therapist has taken you as far as you can go individually. She isn’t going to recommend something that she thinks would be pointless. Since she knows you, and you trust her, think about giving group a shot. Commit to 3 sessions. If you hate it still after that, at least you can say that you were willing to try. Food for thought.

2. Avoid radiowaves and electromagnetic radiation. Radiowaves can 'burn' brain cells by overexciting them cause them to spazz out and eletromagnetic radiation also excites the brain cells.   
3. Amyloban 3399 is a healthy alternative to psychotics. It corrects brain function and has NGB which regrows brain cells. (start at 1/2 pill since its really potent).   
4. Krill Oil helps rebuild the blood brain barrier which can get damaged or broken down, contains essential oils which the body cannt produce.   
5. Lithium Carbonate also stimulates brain growth, comes from Japanese Lithium springs, you an buy online  
6. Peanuts. Peanuts have lots of tyrosine, the amino acid for creating the neurotransmitter dopamine and serotonin. Serotinin plays a key role in brain repair. Also Vitamin E is good for you.  
7. Meditation and sleep. Your brain repairs itself and reorganizes itself when you sleep and releases dopamine and serotonin.   
8. Get negative ion lightbulbs and lamps. Humans evolved in a highly negative evironment, outside the Earth has a negative 500,000C charge, but inside our homes is positively charged due to electrical wires, outlets, tvs, computers, etc. These positive ion radiation is bad for the body and causes oxidative stress. Make sure you do not sleep near an electrical outlet and also have your windows open as much as possible.  
9. Socialize with people.  
10. Open your chakra (which is easier said than done.) The shalin monks bash their heads against stone and hang weights from their you-know to open their chakras. When you undergo suffering, you gain wisdom which is the light in the world and the darkness is ignorance. So through self-discipline, and suffering, you can become wise and learn true love which will coincide with the opening of you chakras.

It's such a scary feeling to know that you had your first suicide attempt, or in my case I was going to attempt it but it got ruined. Funny advice your doctor gave you, he shouldn't have though because it's basically a tip for you to commit suicide... although it's pretty funny that you hit that punchline &lt;3 

I was diagnosed with conversion disorder (hysterical neurosis), which made me feel like I'm in the Freud era lmao, but my therapist later told me that I am developing Borderline Personality Disorder. My mother and sister didn't take it seriously and told me that I'm just wanting to get attention... painful.

I'm depressed right now, very depressed. At least I don't feel like committing suicide today, which is a good thing. I know what you mean when you say that in the moment it all feels so real, obsessions, depression, anger, sadness, self hatred, exhaustion, worthlessness... pain... and ironically enough feeling like you're empty and there's no emotions.

&gt; When you feel like killing yourself, know that the feeling is in your head, not your heart (analogy).

**Extremely true**. My emotions are shut down (I already have problems with my emotions so it's difficult enough) and my brain is racing with thoughts that somehow make me feel *nothing at all*... just, convincing myself about how dying is the only option one has left.

Sometimes I get amazing days where I feel like the world is on the palm of my hand and I'm the king of everything, that there's so much energy in me but it suddenly goes away... I feel like I have no identity at all, I don't know who I am (BPD).

Thank you so much, thank you thank you thank you! Your message really brought me hope. I've written so many documents in my macbook today and I'll keep writing them because it's one of my coping methods.

I was diagnosed bipolar I so I know how you feel. I've attempted once, but I'll never try again. I was depressed, woke up at 2 am and couldn't go to sleep. Racing thoughts. Just got up, slit my wrists and slept better than I have in my entire life. Probably because of blood loss? 

My dad found me in the morning and took me to the hospital where they stapled my wrists shut. I wasn't on any medication at the time. The funniest part is the doctor told me that I was supposed to aim slightly on the outside of my wrists, not the middle, in order to hit the artery and die. I replied ""okay, I'll remember that for next time."" You should've seen the look on his face. Priceless.

I don't feel like that unless I'm in a depressed phase, so now I know it's just in my head. It never feels like that in the moment though. Everythings justified in your head: delusions, anger, depression, obsession. At least that's how I see it.

When you feel like killing yourself, know that the feeling is in your head, not your heart (analogy). Also, think of your future. It's going to change multiple times. You don't really know where the destination is, and I'd like you to not commit suicide so I can hear about yours. 

Focus on the present and what's ahead. Don't stay stuck in the past; you'll drive yourself mad with regret, anger, guilt, and depression. 

No one is leaving you behind. I'm not an exception. Let's say, for shits and giggles, they are leaving you behind; who gives a shit? You're making your own way, your own life with someone you love. If they leave you behind, they weren't yours to begin with. In other words, they aren't worth your energy, and there's nothing you can do to stop it anyway. So it comes down to two choices: stress about something you can't really control, or let it go.

You aren't a burden, and your illness doesn't completely define who you are. You're differentiated by your awesome personality- not an illness, though it can make you stronger or weaker. You stand independently and with those you find you can truly trust. The others are hurdles. Really, really high hurdles.

I'm always here, but I'll warn you, I'm in a euphoric mindset right now so I feel like the world is my oyster. That probably translates very strongly in this message.

Anyway, from the other post you sound young and scared about your parents’ reaction (I don’t blame you). I can’t tell you that mental health professionals are all perfect angels and that meds will always work, but if this is something that’s really bothering and/or hindering you, I’d recommend at least starting small. Tell someone (parents, school counselor, whoever) about about how you feel and make it clear you don’t want to be on medication. Also, research different kinds of therapies and medicines. (Honestly if I could go back in time and give myself one piece of advice about going to doctors it would be to read up about medicines.) Therapy can help, and it’s a lot better than sitting alone with your thoughts building up.

If you really don’t want to go down that route, I’d at least suggest getting into some forums or other communities dedicated to mental health, where people can vent. Again, this is all if you really feel you need it.

I’m just gonna say this real quick, because it bears repeating, symptoms like hallucinations/unreality/anxiety don’t automatically make you psychotic. People are unique in their experiences and the way they experience their mental illness. Try not to get really upset about all of these ‘what ifs’, especially by people on the internet who don’t know you and stay safe.

I'd consider running it by your PCP to see if there are any potential medical causes, and whether a referral to an audiologist/neurologist could be worthwhile. It is possible to use stress coping skills during those times when you're feeling anxious/rage because of the noises. Something I'd think about trying is a grounding technique. Rather than focusing on the noise, try to notice 5 things in the room (https://www.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/wellbeing/documents/Mindfulness_and_Being_Present.pdf). I'd maybe skip the notice 5 noises and focus on your other senses instead. Our brain's attentional system can only focus on one thing at a time (sorry multi-taskers), so by intentionally focusing on other things in the room you aren't allowing it to focus on the noise.

A quick search didn't show anything specifically looking at children raised by parents with personality disorders (lots of articles, but no scholarly research). I think that we still have a long way to go for truly understanding and EFFECTIVELY treating both BPD and NPD. The problem mainly lies in the fact that many people who are likely BPD or NPD don't believe they have a problem... everybody else is the problem. 

I've worked with several people raised by parents with personality disorders and they've pretty consistently shown a lack of self-esteem, low confidence, poor relationships, depression and/or anxiety. It can be downright traumatic growing up in a household like that. I often help people learn to establish proper boundaries (both with the parent and with others in their life), and develop a sense of self-efficacy. It's also a balancing act to not demonize the parent, because often they still want to maintain that relationship despite the evidence of it being unhealthy. This is actually some of my favorite work because there is so much unrealized potential, and I love when they finally recognize what I've seen from the beginning.

Exercise releases our body's natural pain killers, which helps us to better cope with life's stresses.

DrKevinHyde,,,,,,,,,,"Thanks for asking! Medication is one of those topics where everybody has an opinion, but there is no definitive right or wrong answer. For your question specifically, I'd say it's neither always, nor a last resort. It's just another tool we have (referring to a MD or psychiatrist) when it may be helpful. Controlled trials of most anti-depressants only show benefits for moderate to severe depression, so I wouldn't refer unless they met that criteria, or there were other co-occurring issues that I'd want a psychiatrist's thoughts on (e.g., possible manic episodes, hallucinations). In those cases a combined medication/therapy treatment can have positive results. Unfortunately, the brain is so complex that we still have much to learn about effective pharmacological treatments. 

Regarding anxiety, medication tends to be more of a band-aid as you mentioned. That's not to say some people don't find it helpful, but it can actually hamper the therapy process. I can understand why anxiety patients want medication, because it really sucks!! It is so uncomfortable and limits your life in so many ways.

I learned more about the psychologist's scheduling recently. They don't have a set schedule, they schedule the next appointment at the end of each session. Plus, they apparently meet less than 40 minutes each time. My FIL is quite the talker, so I can't imagine how these appointments can be so short. He can easily talk to me for an hour (things he should be discussing with a therapist) without letting me even get a word in.

This makes me very suspicious that my FIL isn't getting the mental health care that he really needs. He has barely made any progress and seems to be regressing. We're constantly educating him on things we really think that a counselor should be working with him on, but he acts like he's never heard of these concepts before.

Does any of this send up warning flags to you about this psychologist? Should we try to get him to see someone else?

One problem is that even though he's very well off financially, he refuses to pay for mental health care and will only see someone who accepts Medicare or is free (he's tried to get into free clinics, but has been rejected as you can imagine). Is that part of the problem? Is it possible to get satisfactory mental health care through Medicare only? Should we try to get him to see someone who may only accept cash?

I am really worried about my husband's mental health and I am not sure that I can stay in our relationship much longer. He has struggled with clinical depression for a long time, but especially over the past 5-6 years. We have been together for 17 years, and married for 10. After some very low points he finally sought treatment for his depression. He has been on Wellbutrin for about a year, I think. During this last year, unfortunately, our relationship has gone from bad to worse. His depression actually has gotten a little better, but it has been replaced with, for lack of a better term, a very persistent and extreme form of anxiety. 

Here is where I am struggling to talk to him, our therapist, and our physician. ""Anxiety"" is does not go far enough to describe what happens to my husband during one of these episodes, which can last most of a day sometimes. His speech changes, his posture changes, he get's a little bit of a lisp and becomes irritable, irrational, and he loses much of his short term memory. He'll tell me that I said things that I didn't say or he won't remember something I just said. He becomes a completely different person. I am really worried about his mental health, I am worried about our marriage, and I am worried about him forgetting that the stove is on or some other potentially dangerous behavior. 

Again, I have been expressing concerns about this to him, our therapist, and our physician for about a year and have not gotten the traction that is needed for the seriousness of what is going on.

realstoned,1304295055.0,,,,,,,,t2_56dc8,"I am a medically approved user of CBD oil, but I do not suffer from a serious mental illness. This is based on my personal experience.

CBD oil is not a magic bullet as some would have you believe. It is naturally occurring, but it is still a psychoactive substance. I would suggest conferring with your psychiatrist about it and ensure that you use it in a controlled manner. I have read anecdotes of it worsening symptoms for some, and improving symptoms for others. 

I have been using it for about a year. It has helped my situational stress and it helps me sleep through the night. I find that it works as well or better than pharmaceuticals I have been prescribed in the past, but with fewer side effects. I do not use it every night. I sometimes feel sleepy in the morning if I took it later at night, but that soon goes away. I sometimes take a double dose if I think I need it to sleep, and I definitely feels sleepy in the morning when I do that, but, again, that soon goes away.

I occasionally take it during the day. While it does not get me ""high"" per se, I definitely feel it when I have taken it. I don't drive if I have taken it because I can feel that is impairs my judgement and reaction times. I don't take it during work hours for the same reasons.

I don't ""prefer it over mmj"" because it *is* mmj, just slightly processed. The are strains of mmj that have almost 0% THC and high concentrations of CBD. The oil is typically extracted from plants of such strains. Even slight amounts of THC trigger a lot of anxiety and bad feelings in me so I am very sensitive to this.

Just to repeat to everyone, I would strongly advise against taking it without conferring with your normal psychiatrist or doctor, like I would advise with any drug. Don't let the fact that it is naturally occurring fool you into thinking that you can use something like this with no consequences. Like any drug, it could help, and it could hurt.",True,,,0.0,1515680569,,0.0,dsipoyf,False,t3_7po4nd,1.0,,t3_7po4nd,/r/mentalhealth/comments/7po4nd/cbd_oil_as_medication_thoughts/dsipoyf/,2567.0,1517785804,2,,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,public,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lbpixels,1435335988.0,,,,,,,,t2_ocwhg,"The post is a bit old but I figured I could share some of my experience on the subject. I dropped of college while studying physics and computer science because ""why not, I'm good at it"", switched gears, and ended up working where I love.

First, as people said, don't let your parents decide for you. Asking you to stay is a very selfish thing to do. People do travel away for studies and it is no way a family breaker, on the contrary. Sometimes you have to leave to come back stronger (it sounds cheesy but it is true nonetheless). And if you don't come back to Spain, well that's life; London isn't that far anyway. But don't burn bridges either, try to explain to your parents you need to move, maybe ask r/relationships/ for advice.

About your studies, stop studying physics. From the way you described there don't seem to be much chance you will find satisfaction with this career. But here again, you need to come with a solid plan and not burn any bridges. Here are some advice:

**Get a Bachelor's in physics**: first, complete a college degree. Given the European study system, a complete bachelor's degree (3 years study) could be very important for the rest of your studies. First it will allow you to continue with a master's degree in another field. Second this would be a backup if you need to find a job at any point. Third, it will give you some time to think about what's next.
(I'm bit confused what year you are currently studying, and if your planning for a 3 years or 4 years degree, but that's my advice anyway)

**Find a path in the music industry**: you didn't point to anything specific you want to do in music, so maybe this is an important advice. I'm not a specialist of the field, but I can assure you there are countless way to work in music and you need to explore them. Even if you want to be a professional bass player, given the difficulty this need to be a long term goal. Get your foot in the door, and work from there. Maybe you could use your background in physics and start a master's degree in audio engineering?

**Work up your skills**: in creative industries, personal skills will often outweigh a formal degree, so you need to be proactive in becoming good at what you want to do, even if it's not part of your current studies. This is not limited to being a good musician or technician, but also knowing the industry you want to be part of inside out. The is where you will have to put hard work, but if you love it it shouldn't be a problem.

Ending notes: I have never met someone who has regretted changing his career to something he loved. Also, I used the word ""Industry"" liberally but don't be afraid by it, there is a lot of creativity to be found; but someone has to pay the bill in the end.

Here, this was longer than expected, but don't hesitate to ask for more advice of for my personal experience, I could go on and on about this subject :)

[deleted],,,,,,,,,,"&gt; It frustrates me even more when I see just ok looking women with such handsome boyfriends and husbands and I can't understand why that can't be me.

Until you understand why they seem to achieve something you can’t, you are going to struggle.

&gt; I can't understand why it's so hard to get into commercial modeling when I feel that I have a not bad looking face and I see other commercial models who I feel are just ok looking.

Again — the problem is you’re focused in how you feel, when you’re not the one calling the shots.

There isn’t an easy solution to this, having a more accurately calibrated view about how others can be very painful. The benefit is you’ll have a better idea about how you can make your life better instead if just bashing your head against the wall.

I take 5mg before 2-3hours before sleep time.

It also inhibits mental processes but by 2.5 mg this should not be a problem. at 10mg it was almost impossible to work as a programmer, 5mg - better.

now i use 2.5mg when i have problem with sleep - it works fine.
