This happened to my child a few years ago. He came home with four bruises on his arm that looked like they were from fingertips. It was a very scary experience because my child couldn’t tell me what happened. I talked to the school and brought him to the doctor. The school interviewed all the teachers and paras and told me that several staff witnessed an untrained substitute teacher move my child in an unsafe way. The school sent this information in a report to the Department of Education, who conducted their own investigation. The doctor made sure nothing was broken and also made a report. The school worked with me to add new rules about who could move my child. All of the staff who worked with my child were taught how to move him safely. The school never hired the substitute again.

What I did - no melatonin, because he fell asleep no problem, but started giving magnesium supplements. Calm chewies, three a day. 

I started keeping him up until 8 or 8:30pm. Lots of exercise and he had to go outside and play, if he didnt get outside play he wouldn’t sleep through the night. 

I stopped getting up with him. Absolutely no talking or electronics, but he could do whatever he wanted. His sleep cycle would get better and then he’d resume night waking.

Your personal interpretation isn't inherently right. I note that you have abandoned devotion to the dictionary definitions when it turned out that they were the opposite of what you thought they should be, although again, dictionaries are descriptive, not prescriptive. 

Ultimately, it's useful to have words that reflect our emotional states. Indeed, slightly different connotations for different words is why we have many synonyms at all. Why bother having both ""average"" and ""mediocre"" if they had the same connotation? Why bother having ""different"", ""unusual"", ""abnormal"", and ""freakish""?

,abcdol,,,[],,,,text,t2_107ble,False,,"If I were you, I would change your son psychiatrist ASAP. Children under age of 6 MUST NOT TAKE ANY MEDICATION. I work in medical field, interact with psychiatrist everytime I work, and had an aussie son who's now 6 years old.

Speaking from my experience, study, and perspective:
Consult with another psychiatrist. Keep in mind, stop nagging with MD about medication for 4 years old. Depending on their severity, these kids need ABA Therapy. They are growing and couldn't differenciate reality with internal stimuli. Think about it: Medication will not tell them what's real or not, then who will? It is us the parents. They need Therapy, Activity, and Interaction with reality. Not medication.

They need to learn what's appropriate or not. What's real or not. They're not the one who will get it once being told. They may need 10x more repetition than others in order to get it. Will medication help them do that? In fact, no. Your son, who is growing, will build resistance to it. 

My son used to sleep at midnight every single night before. But he never been on any medication except tylenol and antibiotic. 

This is what I did so far: 
When he turned 3, I requested for more hours of ABA Therapy. He attended Therapy school from 9-5pm. His school is 40 minutes away from our home. After school, if he has energy, we take him to mall, play ground, parks, swimming, etc. We locked any gadget after dinner time. Go outside during sunset and explain the difference between day and night. 

See the key here? Is your son having enough activity during day time? If he still hyper ask him to exercise / dancing/ hopping / playing puzzle, coloring, counting, singing, whichever activity which drain his energy. Repeat same activity over and over until he gets the habit. Read something boring books and turn off the light during nap time. Reduce any stimuli an hour before bedtime. 

Keep it in mind that their brain is wired differently unlike other kids. Don't take shortcut by giving him medication. You will have more dificut times when he grows up. Learn how to handle him instead. It is difficult, but your son future is in both your hands and your husband hands.

,Lady_Bernkastel,,,[],,,,text,t2_g4y6w,False,,"I can explain, though, to prevent misunderstandings, it may be best to explain *why* things have ended up this way in the first place. I suffer from severe depersonalization, to such an extent that I feel as if mind and body are almost entirely detached from one another. Over time, I've found myself seeking out ever more extreme ways to lessen this feeling of detachment and regain some sense of control over the body I effectively feel trapped within. If ignored, it turns into a compulsive nagging which gradually envelops the entirety of my thoughts until a suitable outlet can be found. I've felt this way since early childhood, and no formal treatment has yielded positive results. Trauma has most definitely worsened it, but it was already well-established as part of my personality before any truly traumatic events occurred. This needs to be said, as, otherwise, I've found it all but impossible to convince others that I'm not just seeking attention. 

By my judgment, there are four specific features which attract undue attention. The way I dress seems to be the one viewed as most incomprehensible. It took years of gradual evolution to reach such a point, but, as of now, it's basically just gothic lolita. I've put a good deal of thought into why I've ended up this way and have come to the conclusion that, on some subconscious level, the idea of a fashion based on Victorian dolls is almost uniquely suited to one who views her body as an external object which must be taken care of. I've also managed, over the years, to accumulate a great many tattoos. In addition to random ones elsewhere, my arms and hands are pretty thoroughly covered, and I've accumulated several on my face. These aren't *too* extreme (a relative statement if I've ever made one), but, at the same time, it's immediately obvious to anyone who sees me from any distance where features would even be discernible. The appeal of this, given what's been stated above, should be obvious and in no need of elaboration. Thirdly, simply being in a public space leaves me entirely overstimulated as a rule, and this shows through behaviour, posture, mannerisms, voice, etc. As I said elsewhere, it tends to be assumed that I'm either on drugs or am psychotic and just barely in touch with reality. Finally, my hair has always attracted attention. It's long, *extremely* curly, and tends to be worn in a rather disheveled manner which hides most of my face. 

For years, people have regularly been telling me that I'm the strangest person they've ever met, and for reasons extending well beyond physical appearance. I believe them. Given how things have been going, the idea of what I'll be like in ten or twenty years is frightening. I know that I'm eventually going to reach the point where responses begin to turn aggressive, and I feel the need to prepare for that eventuality. Not having the slightest idea when such a change can be expected makes this extremely difficult. 

&gt;Anyone who goes further than a comment or glare is acting in an unpredictable way themselves. So it's impossible to predict this.

This is a very good point and, I fear, may be the only answer to such a question. It's so very frustrating how there's no reasonable way to quantify and predict emotional reactions to unique situations.

They have severe ADHD , with such a short attention span by the time the instructor showed how to make the lotus flower pose the child is already at the roof, they can also have intelectual disabilty, so they have no reasoning as why they even have to do that. Anyway, I'm glad ABA works for your child.

As an older person on the spectrum (57 years of age), I am also uncertain as to why I would seek advice from a neruotypical on reddit. 

The advice offered by neurotypicals to people on the spectrum often involves how to mainstream or ""fit in."" Since I wasn't diagnosed until much later in life, I grew up having to ""fit in"" and any questions I may have would be highly specific and would properly be addressed to neurotypical colleagues at work who know me ... not anonymous people (whoever informed and well meaning) on a subreddit who wouldn't be aware of the situational context for my specific concern.

I also think that having a forum for autistic people to ask for advice from neurotypicals would be somewhat condescending because this would imply that only NTs know the answers. 

With the possible exception of trained psychologists and/or special education teachers with certifications in autism, what do most NTs know about masking and building work arounds to deal with social awkwardness? 

I don't think another subreddit is the way to go, particularly if it's going to be billed as a place where those of us who are on the spectrum may solicit advice from neurotypicals. 

If I were to seek advice, I'd rather seek it from someone on the spectrum, particularly if that person had had a previously similar experience with a successful resolution.

Most employers don't want mindless drones. Most employers also provide some sort of training since you can't be expected to do your job properly unless  you know what that job actually entails.

If you have questions during training, ASK. If after you've started work, you're not sure about something, ASK. Talk to your supervisor or ask a co-worker. 

I'm on the spectrum and although most of my work has been in education, I've held a number of part time jobs over the years. I've been a mortuary assistant, a motel desk clerk, a supermarket stocker and carry out. I've also been a university campus security guard, I've written software, been a host/cashier at a restaurant, and I've been a server, prep cook, line cook, and dish washer. For three years while I was teaching, I even drove a school bus and had routes before and after school. 

All of these jobs came with training though some types of training were more extensive than others.

You are young and your experience has been limited. As you get older and develop more life (and work) experiences, you will find that the concept of work isn't as stressful as it currently is. While I have never been certain as to the validity of the phrase, ""Age brings wisdom,"" I do believe that age brings experience ... and with experience you will have increased self-confidence.

It’s interesting that you mentioned that you’d rather point or use sign language when you could. I do believe this is the case with my son. He actually can say quite a few words, but he only uses a few consistently and some days he chooses to not use any at all. 

Today was an awesome day for him verbally. He said “bubble, no, chip, tv, again, all done, dog, Night-Night, amen, thank you” so I know he’s capable of saying those words.

It appears your parents aren't the best humans, so I suggest letting them call you whatever they want, and just know that it's a gift you are giving to them that they will never care about or appreciate. 

Now, my name is something I also never liked. It's a common first name, so common there was 5 of them in my 36 person home room. It is also commonly shortened to a name I just do not like. When I was 15, a friend gave me a nickname that I used online (nope, not ScannerBrightly), and that is the name I go by right now. My friends and coworkers call me by my nickname, and it's on my business card. 

When I was in college, on the first day of class the teacher would roll-call and I would just state as fact, ""Here! Please, call me ""nickname"" Thank you."" Granted, my nickname is a non-standard name and I get some people mis-hearing it to other more common names, but I correct them (using the Nato alphabet) and they generally get it. 

That said, my oldest brother refuses to call me that (but he's a jackass), and my mother will often slip into my 'birthname' (but I'll allow her, as changing my name wasn't an insult to her at all), but I'm glad I did it.

Having stuff in my mouth is also comforting. I used to have issues with nail-biting and shirt-chewing. These days I chew between 1 and 3 pieces of gum a day.

Smells are also an issue for me. Food that smells slightly off can ruin a meal just as easily as an anomaly in taste or texture can. I instinctively avoid the smell of tobacco, musty wood and other ""old building smells"", and certain cleaning products.

Sounds and lights are very mixed for me. I'm sensitive to loud sounds generally, and especially high-pitched or noisy ones. Loud movies or music, crowds, and loud mechanical noises are some of my top offenders. My tolerance of light varies greatly - sometimes I can stare directly into an LED flashlight and be mesmerized, other times doing so is almost painful.

,InterdepartmentalYam,,,,,,,,,,,"1. Has he been screened for an ear infection or, more generally, has the health of his ear been assessed? Sounds stupid but sometimes it's most useful to start with the least complicated answer and work our way up.

2. An OT can assess sensory needs. A mental health professional can assess compulsive behaviors. Sometimes team meetings are worth their weight in gold.

3. I think the same answer and number two applies to this one, as well. At some point, for some folks, the device begins to enable limitation instead of empowering the individual and removing the limitation. If it's assessed the device is limiting him, a team meeting with parent, OT, PT, mental health, special education, classroom teachers, DD, etc., can support the child by allowing all the professionals to brainstorm the ways the device (or anything else) is impacting the child across each domain.

,TheFeshy,,,,,,,,t2_4d7rn,,,"&gt; We can only hope that one day he talks again, but the fact that no one can tell us how this turns out is terrible.

This is one of the things I struggle with as well - that no one can seem to predict the final outcome.  

My daughter is in every program we can find, with constant work from us as well - we're doing everything we can, but it seems like all we can do is slightly weight the dice.  It's still unpredictable, and that's very hard to handle sometimes.  She may develop enough skills to go to regular kindergarten with nothing more than a few modifications on her IEP.  Or, she might never say more than a few words a year for her entire life, and no one can tell us which it will be.  All they can say is that she's improving, and that's usually a good sign.  But nothing is certain.

One of those improvements is ""playing"" with toys again.  Not many, and not properly (she isn't going to ""zoom"" cars around on the table, but she will line them up, spin their wheels, etc.) - for a while, the only toys she really wanted to interact with were drinking straws!  The  local restaurants got used to us raiding their drink sections for straws, grabbing different colors from different chains to give her some variety.  Red was her favorite, and in public it was a struggle to keep her from stealing any straw she could find in someone's cup.

But occupational therapy helped this a lot, and it really lead her to much more physical activities.  Even if she seldom plays with toys, she *loves* the trampoline, she can use a slide (and sometime stairs/ladders to get to the slide), and would climb all day long if we let her.

Songs are another familiar problem.  My daughter won't sing, won't take interest in songs, won't dance along (though she'll jump excitedly for her favorite songs in her favorite shows.)  But we just kept at it anyway, and now she really likes ""head, shoulders, knees, and toes.""  She won't sing along, or even do the motions yet - but she will ask us to sing it to her and move her hands, by grabbing our hands and placing them on her head to start the song.

Does this mean she likes the song?  Does she know the words, but just can't/won't say them?  Does she realize that we're naming the body parts that we touch?  There's no way to know, yet.  But she's interacting with us over it, she's communicating purposefully, and it was less than a year ago that we struggled to find even one way in which she would.  So it's an improvement, no matter how small.",1519313593,,dunl3rd,False,t3_7zag08,,,t1_dun7f2d,/r/autism/comments/7zag08/my_son_stopped_speaking_at_two_here_is_our_story/dunl3rd/,1520120721,3,,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,,,1285197078.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,2.0,22384.0,,public,,,,,,,,

,TheFeshy,,,,,,,,t2_4d7rn,,,"My daughter is almost three, and we've had a diagnosis since two.  We suspected at 12 months, and were pretty sure at 18 months.  It's hard to look back at even infant behaviors and wonder ""was this a sign of autism? Was that?""  But after the few words she was learning had been gone for a few weeks, we were pretty sure.

Fortunately, in her case what looked like problems with small motor coordination was more of a problem with small motor motivation - if we put an M&amp;M in a hard-to-get place, she suddenly had a lot of small motor coordination!  So occupational therapy really helped with that, but she still never took to signs.  Except, again, in places of strong motivation - we can't get her to sign ""eat"" when she is hungry, but she'll sign it every time she sees a cupcake.  We still keep up with it anyways, as we are never certain if she is understanding it and just not doing it, or might start doing it sporadically, like with her few words.

We just started PECs cards this week, with foods.  It's hard to tell, yet, how well she grasps the idea.  When she picks a food card, she eats what we bring her from the card - but she was usually pretty good about eating anyway.  She has to be; she's off the top end of the height-weight growth chart (unlike my older daughters, who were at about the 8% and 15% mark - very small for their ages.)

It is interesting to see which foods she picks, though.  She just chose a breakfast of apple slices and sausage.  I'll have to print cards pretty often, though - at least at first.  In her usual, very literal way, we haven't gotten her to hand us cards yet - she just picks the food she wants, and bites the card, lol.  But it's a start.

I didn't see any other kids in the video, so I'm guessing Henry is your first?  I'm not sure which way is easier.  On the one hand, it's hard not to compare where she is at to where her sisters were at this age.  On the other hand, it's great to see her play and interact with her older sisters - they don't care that she's autistic; it's just the way she is.",1519311943,,dunjh3d,False,t3_7zag08,,,t1_dunexyi,/r/autism/comments/7zag08/my_son_stopped_speaking_at_two_here_is_our_story/dunjh3d/,1520119802,1,,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,,,1285197078.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,5.0,5390.0,,public,,,,,,,,

,kittyfists,,,,,,,,t2_yq4zk,,,"You say you make a lot of money but you find this disabled person inconvenient.  You don’t want to have to spend any money because of a disabled person who is making your life hard.  You would rather they move somewhere out of your life so you don’t have to deal with it. That’s how most of society feels. I’m sure they would love to own a home. They probably do not have enough money to do so. You are presenting it as if they are simply choosing to not own a home. I’m sure they would prefer to not have to live in fear of being evicted over something they can’t control. 

$1000 is a drop in the bucket for the price of disability services. It’s true, you might be able to get the landlord to kick a disabled person out of an apartment using your good job, and your status as someone who got there first, and your social relationship with the complex. I’m not sure that would be the kindest, most Christian thing to do.  What if you had an elderly neighbor who watched TV at insane volumes twenty four hours a day? Would you try to have them kicked out? What if they snored really loud? What if someone moved in who had lung cancer and coughed loudly and violently day and night? Would you then say, “Look, I respect your right to be sick but I was here first. I make a good living and I work hard and I deserve to have a healthy stable quiet home. Please, evict this dying man so that my home will be more peaceful.”

The kind options are to move or soundproof your house. The cruel option is to attempt to throw your weight around and try to get them evicted, which may or may not work. I get that this unexpected expense is not fair. I agree that it is not fair. I think pretty much every unexpected expense is a bit unfair. They deserve housing as much as you do, and I doubt they can afford to just go buy a house somewhere. You could also try talk to them about sound proofing options .

You may have developed some sort of inhibition unrelated to anxiety, too. But something is blocking it. Could even be related to something sensory. Your brain might be working hard to deal with all the stimuli around you, and then any gregarious tendencies might get suppressed.

Maybe having some small gatherings with a bit of dancing included might habituate you to dancing with others leading you to be more inclined to dance with larger numbers of people?

It is a tough question, as there could be varying explanations.

Try writing down some hypothetical reasons for it and figure out from there what you might fo to change things. When you have found what feels like the best hypothesis you might be able to get more practical advice after sharing what you suspect the cause might be.

While there are expressions which are signs of certain emotions, you need to take into account a lot of different variables: the context, and knowledge of, and relationship with, the person giving the facial expressions.

I've spent many years studying on how to read people and gauge their intentions through their expressions. Sometimes it is simply a pure reaction to emotion. Other times you can pick up that the expression signifies something more complex. 

Often people will use their expressions as signals to communicate something without the use of words, as direct speech for some things may come across as rude, not to mention a little clunky. A bored person may frown which could be a sign of anger, but in a certain context it could constitute boredom.

The other party should be able to figure out that the person is bored from why they have that expression in the given context. For a lot of people they would feel it too forward or pushy to just say ""Look, I am bored, would you mind that we talk about something else?""

That could lead to the other person feeling bad that the bored person had to actively say they were bored, when they should have been able to tell from certain cues which normally speeds social interactions along in a more harmonious way, and can help avoid unnecessary confrontations sometimes. That's just my hypothesis, though.

That is just one example. Luckily I am usually able to figure this kind of stuff out as I have been actively studying human behaviour to better my social skills for 18 years, starting when I was 12. It is largely second nature to me now, but when tired, stressed, or ill then I find it difficult to run these ""social algorithms"" I use.

I’ll add that if you do choose ABA, don’t be that parent who uses it as a babysitting service. Be involved in the process and be present for the programs. No decent ABA program will deny that it’s important you are able to maintain the programs on your own when the therapist isn’t present. The reasons I see for failure *today* ( not like in the past when it may have been more damaging) is that many parents think they don’t have to participate or continue the programs and the child only receives therapy/interventions when they see the therapist. That is really not beneficial.  

Also, don’t be afraid to ask for a new tutor or therapist. Not every situation is a good mix. Even good providers  are usually understaffed for the communities needs, but a good provider will be happy to try and work with you to find a great pairing for your family. We had a primary tutor/therapist who was wonderful, but because she had so many clients we only saw her two days a week. The rest was with another therapist. We went through four of the “others” before finding one who was great with our kiddo. Nothing bad about the other people per se, just wasn’t a good mix for us.

One of the studies was performed with monkeys, which is important because monkeys are better human disease models than mice. 

Note that the monkey study states ""These results extended the findings in rodent MIA models to more human-like behaviors resembling those in both autism and schizophrenia.""

Early life neuroinflammation causes many brain disorders and mental illnesses, including autism, schizophrenia, anxiety, bipolar, depression and more. The research on immune activation and brain disorders is revolutionary and paradigm-shifting. It also points a giant finger of blame at vaccines, because vaccines cause neuroinflammation. 

The specific type of brain damage depends on genetics, intensity and type of inflammation, nutrition status and other factors. its complicated. Research in this area is exploring how these other factors interact (e.g. looking at different mouse strains, effects of nutrients etc). This study shows that vitamin D prevents the damage: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5351212/pdf/13229_2017_Article_125.pdf 

Your second example is relevant to inflammation. Inflammation (of the IL-6 type) causes an increase in excitatory synapses, and decrease in inhibitory synapses, which manifests as hypersensitivity to sights and sounds. Neuroinflammation (IL-6 specifically) causes sensory disorders. Human autistics have an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses.

Everyday they have a specific time for lunch, math, reading, even bathroom breaks and then they have these random events and expect kids to adjust easily to that change. 

At home, if you’ve been flexible from the start he will be WAY more willing to continue that flexibility because that is the “norm” or “routine” in that environment. 

If he is attempting verbal communication - I would hold off on using the pictures at home and really try and shape his verbal responding. If he pulls you to the cookie jar, for example, immediately prompt him for a simple “c” sound or “coo” then quickly give it to him. Next time try for a little more “cook” and then quickly give it to him. Try this for all things he asks for. Before giving in, try to get some sort of sound or attempt. This is called “mans training” and when used with the “shaping” technique it is SO effective. I have used this with my young clients to teach speech. You can google it! :)

As far as what goes on in therapy, the very general process is we perform curriculum assessments to determine what skills the client has, and a functional analysis of problem behaviors to try and find out what causes the behavior and what consequences follows that behavior. 

Using the information yielded from those assessments we develop a treatment plan to reduce problem behaviors and teach skills appropriate for the client. How that goes is specific to the client. 

For example if a client is engaging in self injury, and our functional analysis shows that the likely cause of self injury is in order to get access to objects  (for example mom tells the client no and the client engages in self injury, prompting mom to give them the denied object).

A possible treatment would be to stop giving objects when self injury occurs, blocking self injury as needed, and also teaching appropriate replacement behaviors such as asking, or teaching how to tolerate delays or even outright no. 

This is a simplified explanation, but that's the basic broad idea of the treatment process.

Often NT adults will give me the “what’s wrong with you?” type of condescension in their words and actions and it gets frustrating and emotionally taxing. Most of the time however, this obsessive compulsive response isn’t provoked at all. Even innocent simple things I’m doing can make me feel like I’m being judged. “Ew how dare that kid tie his shoe? The nerve of him.” That’s what I feel like others are thinking.

Firstly, he might not feel like he knows you well enough yet. Don't take it personally, but it might take longer than you are used to for him to feel like opening up to you.

In the mean time, you have two options. First is just having a little simple chat regularly. The aim here isn't to have the world's greatest conversation, but just to invest a little bit in the hope that it leads to a better relationship in the long run. A quick ""did you do anything fun this weekend?"" will do the job, and hopefully help you pick up some topics to talk about.

The second tip, as others have suggested, is to try and talk about what he's interested in. I spent a week working at a residential centre with other disabled people. One of them shared two of my special interests. I asked him a few questions about these things, and he just gave one-word answers, but afterwards I found out that he had really enjoyed those conversations.

It's like I'm talking about a closed box, within which is a piece of paper with a number on it but we can't open the box to look at it. Only look at environmental clues that are related to the number to estimate the number.

You keep talking about the box as if it's open for all to see the number.

Do you get the difference between the two? 

&gt; Because we've created the scenario so know the motivation.

It seems you don't know the difference. The scenario I'm refering to has the motive as being in a black box, is unknown and cannot be directly known.

Autism seems to involve difficulty with ascribing false beliefs. You seem to be resisting or unable to treat the TV thrower as having an unknown intent (the same way a policeman would see it).

Can you imagine an imaginary person throwing a TV but you DO NOT KNOW THEIR INTENT?

If you can't then I'm not getting intent backward, but instead you are incapable of imagining this thing that every NT person can. If you can't imagine it then your responce is much the same as someone with aphantasia is incapable of imagining at all. I assure you all NT people can imagine a character throwing a TV but what their motive is is up in the air, unknown, a riddle, hidden, secret. Even though they are the one imagining the character, they can imagine them but not know their motive.

But I find it hard to believe you can't imagine a black box with a number in it that you don't know. But I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.",1555634097,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",el8beud,False,t3_bdwymy,,True,t1_el6i5bt,/r/autism/comments/bdwymy/im_sick_of_autism_publications_blindly_assuming/el8beud/,1555634098,1,True,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1555757094.0,,,,
,thesoundofthecrowd,,,[],,,,text,t2_2hsiit7n,False,,"OP, Glad you made this post. I have been thinking about ""confirmation bias"" basically every time I saw posts or comments about self-diagnosis, but was not even aware there being a name for it (and honestly, I also thought commenting about this specifically would perhaps upset some people in a way and I was the only one with these thoughts probably anyway).

Certainly some food for thought for me.

Personally, I want to also add that getting diagnosed officially is not difficult or nearly impossible absolutely everywhere though. However, I do realize very well that for certain people, in certain places and/or circumstances, it can be truly nearly impossible. Now, is that the case for everyone claiming so? Nobody knows, and maybe it does not even matter really.

I understand your view, I think mine is somewhat similar. Mainly because of two things; the confirmation bias as you mentioned, but also from personal experience; getting tested myself and realizing how me doing research (while seeming extremely thorough to me at the time) and doing tests online and all that just absolutely pales in comparison to hours of diagnostics.
Even just by reading my final report, I noticed how complex it is to diagnose ASD, things that I have for example never seen mentioned anywhere online in any understandable and accessible form or simply cannot really be described in a general way. I found out things I would have never been able to know, conclude or deduct myself. What possibly means what, why is this connected to that, why does it indicate this and therefore this and that but not this and that? And so on.
I think it can become tricky when people have the tendency to self-diagnose after looking up tons of information, recognizing themselves in lists of symptoms and behaviours or in other people with ASD, because they are often very determined and confident enough in their abilities to do so because of the wealth of information available to us today. But information and even self-insight is not always enough, I think.",1555633888,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",el8b5f8,False,t3_besa6x,,True,t3_besa6x,/r/autism/comments/besa6x/is_self_diagnosis_legitimate/el8b5f8/,1555633888,8,True,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1555756977.0,,,,

,Hangry_Squirrel,,,[],,,,text,t2_126jimbk,False,,"I think the main reason why everyone assumes everyone else is neurotypical is because neurotypical spans a huge spectrum and there is no shortage of us who are weird (kind of weird, regular weird, super weird, cute weird, creepy weird, and so on). Also, a lot of people are aware of the fact that they are not in any way equipped to diagnose other people, so it's easier to assume that they're just a bit strange.

Also, my guess is that a good number of people who appear so ""normal"" are, in fact, various degrees of unusual when they're off the clock. These people would much rather spend time with you and your weirdness than with the corporate poster-boys/girls, but the tricky part is figuring out who they are and how to draw them out.

I'm inclined to think that if the company is committed to hiring neuro-diverse people and has a disability office department, then it's the latter's job to perhaps put together some thoughtful and engaging presentations and maybe do some Q&amp;A sessions with people hired under these schemes who are willing to participate (I'm not advocating for forcing people to do things they might be uncomfortable with). Preferably over beer :p 

It's a matter of putting human faces on very abstract concepts. It's also a way of drawing out people who are curious in a good way, who might have certain affinities with you, and who find you interesting as a person and may want to find out more about you. Others, even if you don't end up spending time socially with them, might have an easier time processing your kind of weird.

I work in the academia, not in the corporate world, and as you might imagine, a lot of us are not exactly cookie-cutter. We also tend to be a very inquisitive bunch. So if you think my idea is all kinds of stupid, it's because I know that something like that would work for us. I'm not sure how it would work in your world, but it's the disability office's job to figure that out.

Teachers are...iffy. There were some I liked a lot, others I didn’t, but nevertheless i liked talking to them. They were the only ones I could have a real conversation with when I was younger, but as I grew older I began to distance myself from them, because social costs. 

I don’t know what a para is, my mom explained them to me once and I can’t remember what she said, but I’m usually in the classes with the teacher helpers now. I didn’t really used to be, besides the couple that would pop in for an hour or so in elementary school. 

I was bullied by most and had around five friends until I moved, and now I have more but I’m still extremely anxious about the friendship, and sometimes I find myself wishing they weren’t my friend so they wouldn’t have to deal with me. 

Nope. Never had an IEP until around 5’th grade, so I was treated normally by most, and the IEP didn’t really do much until 6’th grade when I moved, which was both a blessing and a curse. 

More understanding people of the crap I did. I don’t see the pattern but my parents see a pattern In the start and end of every year something happens. I don’t mean them to do that, to me it’s a coincidence cause it is, but nope that’s not what it is to them. 

Not really. As long as you’re supportive and try to understand why the child seems to be not doing the work they were at the beginning of the year (me. I’ll start every year off well and every year that’s even (6’th, 2’nd, any even grade) I’ll be fine. Any odd year (3’rd, 5’th etc) I’d start okay and then fail by the end of the year.), and you try to understand them and how they work best, if they actually work when talking with others (biggest pet peeve, when teachers yell at me cause I’m talking to a friend while doing work. I’m still doing work why do you care?).",1584668527,{},fkzdlnc,False,t3_flioj4,False,True,t3_flioj4,/r/autism/comments/flioj4/types_of_schooling_on_the_spectrum/fkzdlnc/,1584673441,1,True,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,

What kind of school did you go to?

a regular public school

&amp;#x200B;

What was your relationship like with your teachers?

when they were good, we were best friends. when they were bad, we were sworn enemies

&amp;#x200B;

Did you have a para educator with you?

no

&amp;#x200B;

What was your relationship like with your peers?

not bad and not excessively good

&amp;#x200B;

If you were in mainstream, did you feel included?

no, but I didn't want to. I couldn't understand them and they couldn't understand me and we couldn't understand each other. I wasn't the 'autistic kid' or anything, none of us knew anything about it back then

&amp;#x200B;

What could have made school better for you?

not sure what to say

&amp;#x200B;

Anything else you'd like to share?

~~no~~  edited to say yes. I don't think you said you're becoming/being a teacher but:

don't be patronizing, no baby talk, severity matters, no pointless touch, small talk is not fun, special interests are fun, give us time to speak, if we can't say what we wanna say then that's fine, laugh (not fake laugh!) at our jokes no matter how terrible they are. seriously, that's the worst thing for self-esteem

If you're wrong and they're not like that, you're totally being an asshole to them. If you're right and they are like that, you may have spared yourself some time but you still have no right to boss them around.

Employers do ask for a lot of experience especially here. It is the main reason I haven't found work. I think they ask for too much when it comes to experience and because of that no one would probably apply. It might help to apply for a position even though you don't have the experience.

As for groups that help people with autism find work I haven't seen many here in SA. All the organisations I have found here on reddit are usually based in the US or EU. They also mostly look for people in the IT field. SA and Africa in general doesn't have a lot of support in this regard.

Let me be clear though, I view autism and elopement as two very seperate things (the elderly, schizophrenics, and the developmentally delayed also often have elopement disorders).

My son is 10 now, but this began when he was 4. He is clever, but he is not high functioning and will likely require supervised care throughout his entire life. I state that to remind that nothing I list here is an appropriate solution for every child-- these are solutions for one child. That is especially true as regards autism. Again, these are symptoms of elopement, not autism.

Caregivers should practice ""least restrictive environment."" This is what we had to go to after several incidents of crawling through screened windows, outgrowing or defeating locks, running in front of cars, being picked up by police, trespassing into people's homes, and entering pools and a lake unsupervised, which is an extreme danger. Here are the lengths we've gone to.

1) Double cylinder deadbolts on all doors (i.e. the ones that lock on both sides). When we had a slider, I put on a hasp bolt with a padlock. Fire marshals don't like double cylinders because you must have a key to get out. I keep spare keys hidden under code locks (like realtors use).

2) Service dog. We have a lab that is trained to tether to my son and anchor on command. This is extremely helpful in public. The dog is also a loving companion and provides theraputic pressure when needed (that's my interpretation-- the two of them have a language unto themselves).

3) I disconnected our garage door opener and replaced it with a coded key pad. 

4) I put long screws with bolts over them on window levers. This prevents the lever from moving and the window from opening. Again, fire marshal, but my son leapt from a second story window once.

5) We have an 8 foot steel fence. We used to have a wood fence he was prone to climb (you have to build them backwards so that the cross timbers are on the outside). He likes the steel one because you can see what is going on on the other side. He hasn't tried to climb it since we switched (do not get residential grade aluminum-- it will not stop anyone).

6) Our local fire department and police have Project Lifesaver. It is an RFid tracking bracket so that if he does elope, they can find him quickly. I really recommend checking into this for your community (the elderly often elope as well, so it is a real godsend for communities).

7) We have a system in place where one responsible adult is always in charge of my son. We mark that by a set of keys on a red lanyard. That way there is no ambiguity about who is to be watching him.",1570140289,{},f2cnn95,False,t3_dcse8k,False,True,t3_dcse8k,/r/autism/comments/dcse8k/i_wanted_to_share_what_happened_with_my_son_this/f2cnn95/,1570149802,1,True,[],False,autism,t5_2qhs6,0.0,,1570143628.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tbh the mental hospital that i was in didn’t help with autism, but it did give me time away from the toxic place i lived at and i could form a proper routine there too, which did wonders for me overall, and lastly it „forces“ you to be social as you live with other people wether you like or not. But seeing as that is out of the question you will have to climb out of this well yourself. A therapist might help either way to track your progress and nudge you in the right direction without any meds. (I was on fluexitin for a year and it entirely wrecked my body and my mind for years and only 10 years later now i feel like it doesn’t affect me anymore, so i absolutely feel you about the meds.)
It can also help for you to realize what you want (a job), what you need for it (to have control over social anxiety) and what steps you need to take to get there. (1. try getting into social situations to desensitize. if you have friends, initiate a casual meeting and spend some time to get positive social interactions. Talk to people online, go out to something like a yard sale or an art gallery where you can choose to initiate talk or not. Small steps. 2. CBD Sounds like it’s helping you bit be careful about it if cannabis isn’t entirely legal in your district bc of the drug tests at future jobs, but take whatever feels good to you and relaxes you and doesn’t make you addicted seriously 3. have a healthy environment in your home, keep a daily routine even while unemployed, keep busy, have hobbies that make you work with your hands like cooking or art. Keep a clean room Etc etc.. you know best what steps to take that you personally need in order to get better.) 
So when you know what you need to do you can make it into smaller steps to take. It’s a lot of mental work and i don’t know if you have that kind of time but there is to say that you can’t really get rid of anxiety/mental illness any faster.

* The default environment is definitely difficult for an autistic child.  It's much more ""open"" with kids running around, loud, active, bright, etc - even as an NT adult, it's too much for me.  I suspect our son would have had a much easier time in the classrooms I had as a youth (sit down at *your* desk, everyone is quiet, etc).  However!
* The staff in the schools is well trained to recognize these issues, and there are support staff on hand.  Our boy was had an occupational therapist, a speech and language therapist, a psychologist and a few other people helping him and assessing him inside a week of being in kindergarten, at week 2, he was moved into a different class specifically for kids with such challenges who need additional support.  When I was young, that translated to basically being shut away from everyone else to be out of sight and out of mind, but here it's a pretty elaborate set up with a very high ratio of adults to children.  Instead of the normal 2 adults per ~26 children in kindergarten, it was 1 adult per 2 children, all of which are specialists in related fields such as a speech/language therapist, occupational therapist, etc.

For me, I grew up in the 90s and girls were very very rarely diagnosed. My childhood was terrible. I felt completely and utterly alone. My parents were addicts and were too busy to care for us children. Then at school, I couldn't fit in and couldn't understand why. It was like I was an alien from another planet. I didn't figure out social norms until high school. I've spent the last ten years figuring out how to pass as normal. Now no one can tell I'm not normal, except for those closest to me and those I don't have to wear a mask around. I'm now an addictions counselor at a rehab. From all accounts, I'm a successful normal adult. But the thing is that you don't grow out of Autism, because it is the brain and processing system. 

What this means is that I think differently than everyone else. I am detail orientated, I see the things that no one else does. I am interested in why people act the way they do, what it means to be human, and how we can raise our children to love others workout regard for their religion or skin color.

As a child, I wish I had parents who loved and accepted me as I was. I wish I had had a structure that was healthy, loving and kind to live in... That I could have grown and succeeded in. As a child, I did not need my parents, teachers and community telling me that I was bad, not good enough and needed to change, because that made me into an adult who still never feels good enough.

&gt; I read online that if you can start therapy before the child is 18 months old you can help them significantly.

There's not a ton of therapy beyond PT or therapy for specific physical issues (ie. feeding) for kids below 18 months old. I'm an OT student and I know a lot of OTs won't see kids below 18 months with the exception of some very specific things (like feeding), usually they're just getting PT. Usually here in the US they get seen by PT up until that point in EI therapy. I'm really not sure what therapy you're talking about. There really doesn't sound to me like there's anything TO do right now. 

It sounds frustrating and yes, epilepsy and autism frequently go together, but to me he sounds like he's on the right track as he is. I know it's a normal parental fear to want to give the ""best chance"", but the best thing you can do as a parent right now is breathe. Just breathe, let things happen. Your kid is going to be awesome no matter what. It's tempting to want to jump on every opportunity, but don't fall into the trap of letting your family's life revolve around ""working on it"".

If you are over 18, it's likely it'll be the adult team.

If you are applying to Uni then get in touch with the Disability Office.  They will probably arrange an assessment with you well before you start. 
 
They'll just ask what problems you think you will have in University and then come up with some ideas.  They'll be less interested in medical diagnosis and far more interested in what day to day problems / difficulties you may have.

It's best to plan for the worst case problems and have solutions ready (and funding available) even if you never use them.

To give you things a university might help you with:

1. Typed notes of any lectures.
2. Computer funding or insurance.
3. Extra time on tests / exams.
4. Quiet room for tests / exams.
5. A few hours a week help (social or practical).
6. Ensure you have access to any counselling / GP services / informal check ins.

That's likely to be the same for Autism as Dyspaxia.  My Daughter who had an eating disorder was offered all the above.

Especially if they are on the spectrum, the fact that it feels like socializing doesn't make it so!

Instead, try to approach speech from what might be in their head. Draw the thoughts out. If they are playing silently, ask an open-ended question about their toy. Not something with a one-word answer, it may be an easy reward for you but it doesn't develop fluidity or motivate further conversation. 

If they are somewhat verbal, use the things they do say to spark further conversation. Let them steer.

If they don't talk much, read read read. Read to them, talk to them, soak them in language so they know speaking doesn't have to be goal oriented.

This stuff might be basic(or wrong), it was in classes to prepare for a speech therapy degree and I didn't get as far as all that. However I do see language development in kids in my own life limited to constant quizzing and you can tell the kid is annoyed and stunted.",1548359849,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eeva126,,t3_ajds67,,True,t1_eeuwjkm,/r/autism/comments/ajds67/my_teenage_asd_daughter_trolled_me_at_the_dinner/eeva126/,1548359850,8,True,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another two books with both a US and UK research perspective are:

1. Autism - A very short introduction (Uta Frith)
2. Understanding the Nature of Autism and Asperger's Disorder: Forty Years of Clinical Practice and Pioneering Research (Edward R Ritvo)

These books can be a bit technical, but they go through everything.  They give some idea of what the researchers have gone through to get where we are today.  It's been a life's work for those two - Uta Frith is approaching 80 and Edward Ritvo is 90, but they've never really retired as such.

In addition to this, I simply don't well tolerate the sensory onslaught of public spaces, resulting in behaviour which appears erratic. I've been accosted by police on more than one occasion simply because they interpret it as the result of either intoxication or psychotic illness. The former is something which is technically in my capacity to fix, at least to an extent, by dressing in a more ""normal"" manner, but I just *can't.* I've tried, and the result was an overwhelming sense of having lost something deeply important. 

Something I've come to realize over the years is that a great many people seem to be guided by a fervent, almost theistic belief in some sort of supreme collective will of the human species, referred to simply as ""Society."" This is best exemplified by the common statement, ""Society isn't ready for _____."" Many, especially the more sheltered types who are less used to seeing their inflexible notions of what is permissible being violated, will attempt to condescend on its behalf—this despite the fact that the will of this ""Society"" they speak of is really nothing more than an airing of personal prejudices projected upon the environment and its inhabitants. Arguing that no individual is materially harmed in any way is irrelevant, because, to such people, the injured party is something far worse: the social order itself, and, by extension, the species as a collective. History (as well as my own personal life) has long proven that humans are more than willing to commit incorrigible acts against other humans simply for disrupting whatever has come to be viewed as representing the best interests of society as a whole. This is what I've come to fear. I know that the phenomenon exists and I've seen it in action, yet I find myself absolutely incapable of discerning which actions or states of being will provoke it and which will not.

Good for you for approaching his diagnosis in a positive way, because let’s face it, as parents that’s the way we need to go about it. Here are a few tips that has helped me:

No matter how exhausted I was (depending on the weather of course), I used to take my son out for outings. Getting him out so he could have a repertoire of leisure activities. It will set him up so he could have a lifetime of being able to try different things.

I joined support groups on FB, which helps tremendously. Parents share their frustrations, milestones of their kids, recommend different activities and so on.

Educate your family and friends about what is going on in your household now.

Learn the tools of therapy. There are different types of therapies out there. Do your research and decide what you think will suit your son’s needs. Therapies range from ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis), Floortime method, the rapid prompting method, the Picture Exchange Communication System, verbal behavior analysis, sensory diets, and speech, occupational, and physical therapies. Remember that a combination of therapies may be needed  and that one therapy can work for a while before it plateaus. 

Make time for yourself. You have to be kind to yourself.

I’m not sure. At least, that’s my understanding.

I am still not ready to share my story because I feel like I’m still in the mist of it. My daughter is 2.5 years old and we are a year in on an autism diagnosis.  Even typing that sentence out makes me feel a little anxious because it puts her in a box. She is SO much bigger than a diagnosis or any label or any of her issues. She is the best and the best part is I am her mother and I get to love her no matter what her struggle is. 

My two cents is faith hope and love are the most powerful forces on the planet.  Start there and all the details will fall into place. Therapists, schools etc etc. doors will open. People rush in to help. 

You are NOT alone. And you CAN do this. When we are weak He is strong. 

By the way Your son sounds wonderful!

,ScannerBrightly,,,[],,Parent of Autistic child,dark,text,t2_3lpz3,,,"&gt; I’m plan to try many drugs, and my main interests are psychedelic drugs.

I've been down this road, and I have some advice:

Read up on ""set and setting"", and be sure to have a very good setting for your first experience. Also, read a bunch about what the experience will be like, and maybe even smoke pot a few times before hand to understand the 'losing control' part at least a little before you do LSD.

I also recommend LSD before mushrooms, but finding it might be difficult. Can't really help you there. Last thing to try would be DMT, but again make sure you plan for this before you do it.

,TheFeshy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4d7rn,,,"Others have said it here, but I want to re-iterate and expand:  You will have to let go of some of your current expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

The good news is that we don't mean re-setting an expectation along the lines of ""your boy won't grow into a healthy, happy adult"" like might be said of some other conditions.  No one can (or should) tell you that about autism.  The bad news is that, in some ways, for you it is worse.  Changing or lowering expectations is hard, but in the long run you learn to live with it.  Your task is harder - you will have to *let go* of expectations - because no one can tell you what the outcome will be.  And that's harder, because you have to face it anew every day.

&amp;#x200B;

Letting go of long-term expectations is hard; to be honest I don't know how successful I have been.  But more immediate, and more concerning, is that you're going to have to let go of short-term expectations as well - and this I do feel I've done better at (and can hopefully offer some advice.)

&amp;#x200B;

First, what I mean by that isn't anything like ""give up"" - it's the opposite.  But parents have a tendency to compare their children to a typical yardstick, or their peers, etc.  In a negative light, this means parents can get weirdly competitive over how their kid is doing.  But that also has a healthier flip side - comparing our kids to others helps us know what areas they need more of our help with.  If little Suzy is behind her peers in reading, we might spend more time helping her read, and after some months we expect we'll see some improvement.  Maybe little Suzy will need ongoing help for a long time; maybe she just needs to get 'caught up' and will then be fine with normal instruction.  Either way, we can get little Suzy closer to being ""on track"" - on the path near where her peers are.

&amp;#x200B;

Your child's path will look nothing like this, at least in areas that intersect with the parts of the spectrum he struggles in.  For one thing, the yardsticks of ""neurotypical"" kids won't apply - you might know areas your son is behind his peers, but because he's developing differently, it might not be something you need to worry about - he might just be picking it up on a different schedule or in a different order than other kids.  *Or* it might very well be something you need to help him with a lot, because he's not developing it on his own.  This, obviously, makes it very hard to pick what to work on.

&amp;#x200B;

Worse than that, you're often not going to get the feedback to know how successful you have been.  You might spend months on a skill, and see no outward sign of improvement.  Sometimes this will be because they still need help with that skill  But sometimes they may have already picked it up and moved on, and just aren't interested in demonstrating it.  (This occurs frequently with autistic kids, which is why people here have suggested to ""assume competence."")  It can be hard to tell which.

&amp;#x200B;

Which leads to a short side quest here:  You're going to have to let go of some expectations for yourself, too.  The combination of the above things means you are - because you care and love your son and want to help him as much as you can - going to try to do *all the things all the time.*  You're going to have to let that go; it's just not possible.  You're going to have to do the best you can, but trying to do more than that is going to be detrimental.  You're already seeing this in your own frustrated responses to him, and that frustration won't help you *or* him.  Don't beat yourself up about having done it, but make a concerted effort to move away from that.  Let other things go, if you have to.  And remember it's a skill to improve in yourself, not a sworn oath to keep.  By that, I'll give you an example:  I caught myself yelling at my own daughter because she was trying to drag me away from doing the dishes - a chore I'd already been trying to get to for two hours - to sit next to her while she stacks puzzle pieces.  I realized what I was doing, then remembered:  I spent *three months* working with her to get her to get her to even let me initiate a shared activity, and nearly a year working on stacking things rather than piling them.  And here *she* was initiating an activity to stack things herself.  So long story short, dishes didn't get done, and I sat and stacked puzzle pieces with her.  I had to let the dishes go.  I'm sure I'll forget this lesson and have to remind myself at least a dozen more times before the week ends, but I'm getting better.

&amp;#x200B;

So, back to letting go of expectations - the path your son is going to take is unique.  Many of the landmarks are going to be very different from neurotypical kids, and even from other autistic kids.  And no one can tell you the final or expected destination.  That's the difficult part.  The good part is that you do have access to a pretty good compass.  So even if you don't know the full path, you know (or can learn) the right direction to go at any point.  Let me give you an example of what I am talking about:

&amp;#x200B;

You're worried that your child isn't using certain types of words correctly.  In my case, my daughter (who is 3) is still *almost* totally nonverbal.  She'll use words about once a month (last week, she used the word ""hair"" twice - once for my head hair, and once for my nose hair lol)  I also know parents of kids who are totally non-verbal.  And the point of this isn't that those parents wish they were where I was, and I wish I was where you are, and you wish you where where parent of NT kids are - that way lies nothing but frustration and lack of progress.  The point is that those other parents, and I, and you, can all find things that help our kids where they are at right now, to improve.  We all know which direction to go.

&amp;#x200B;

And we may feel behind where we ""should"", but that may just be because we're looking at the wrong landmarks.  My daughter has never said a color word - but I know she knows colors.  All I have to do to show that is slip a bead of the wrong color into the line of beads she is making, and she'll fix it as soon as she sees it.  The same with shapes; if I give her a triangle, she stacks it with the triangles.  And it's like this for a huge list of things - she seems impossibly far behind if I judge her language skills, and yet the concepts behind those words aren't so far behind at all.  If I let go of the expectation that learning a thing and the word for the thing ""should"" be tied together more closely (because they are for NT kids), than I see that things aren't nearly as worrying - I see progress every day.

&amp;#x200B;

And big picture, that's what you are going to have to do - let go of a lot of expectations and things you thought you knew about childhood development.  Because they are going to be different for your son.  And - this is advice for everyone, parents or not, neurotypical or not - you'll be much happier and much more successful if you don't compare to some arbitrary map or yardstick, but compare to yesterday, last month, last year, etc.  Keep making progress, and focus on the progress you are making.",1537473405,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e6c58z7,False,t3_9hd5yl,,False,t3_9hd5yl,/r/autism/comments/9hd5yl/i_just_want_to_sharemy_son_2yo_just_got_diagnosed/e6c58z7/,1539339717,3,True,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,,,1285197078.0,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1.0,45898.0,r/autism,public,,,,,,,,

I had a similar attendance rate the last few years in high school. I passed all my subjects fine but everything else to do with school was hell.

Longer:

My son was diagnosed at 18 months. He's 13 now. He talks very well. Everybody's experience is different because autism is very different from person to person. I can't say what your experience will be, but your desire to work at things makes a big difference.

Speech therapy was very helpful for my son, but very slow. I expected I'm more focused and rigorous program, and it wasn't that. I bought a book called Engaging Autism by Dr. Stanley Greenspan. I followed his floor time model to join what my son was doing, getting his way a little bit, and show him that he can get a lot out of interacting with other people. We slowly built that into communication, and then speech.

Speech itself is hard. You have to know what you want, translate that into English, and then make your mouth move just right to form the words. My son's really good at this now, but I can tell he still has to think about it. For me it's automatic. Language generation and talking and everything, it was just built in for me. My daughter too. But he has to work at it, and that's okay. He thinks it's worth it, and you can't tell unless you're paying close attention.

Anyway, because speech is hard, starting with sign language can be really helpful. Especially if your child is getting frustrated at not being able to get what they want.

I could go on forever about this, but I don't want to tell you things you already know or say things that are irrelevant.

I think it is possible I may have Asperger's Syndrome based on some tests ive done. Its been suggested to me by my mother who has studied psychology in university and is not stupid and knows me best. She is usually right.

I have two friends in a chat room i own that think they have Asperger's. They are in Australia where the government actually spends money on mental health there and they can get treatment. I have spoken to them at length about their symptoms and behaviour and i can identify.

If I do indeed have ASD, then i dont want to be ""cured"" of it. I think I am very successful. I work a full time job as a Software Engineer in a high tech company. I make a good salary.

I believe my AS (Asperger's Syndrome??) is the cause of my creativity. I get incredibly focused on things. I see Reddit, in some ways as a game; the game being to score points on Karma. I got totally obsessed in my first 3 weeks on Reddit (I joined October 1) and accumulated over 3k in Karma. I did that by intensive focus and by putting in long hours and I could not be interrupted during this time. I needed complete silence, no distractions and no people interrupting me. Is this classic AS?

I was painfully shy as a child and felt i couldnt grow up. I was teased and bullied mercilessly in school. It ended up with me being expelled from school at the age of 8 for fighting. I was sent away to an English boarding school. My parents were sick of me and this is where parents put their kids when they were too busy to parent them. I essentially grew up most of my life as an orphan and that further stunted my social abilities and added to my anxiety. Public speaking terrified me so much, I pissed my pants.

&amp;#x200B;

Through most of my adulthood I tried to avoid all social situations. My marriage was arranged secretly. The marriage was awful and I drank alcoholically. The drinking became so bad, it almost killed me. I had jaundice when I quit. I have not had a drink in 14 years now and would be dead if I hadnt quit in 2004.

&amp;#x200B;

During my first year of sobriety, I grew up. I did the 12 Steps in recovery and let go of all my resentments and forgave everyone. I then made amends to everyone I had fucked over. I came to like myself and love myself. I dont care all that much about what people think of me now; im comfortable in my own skin. And now I try to help other alcoholics.

&amp;#x200B;

I now have no fear of social situations now of public speaking. I told my story of recovery from alcoholism, without a script, to a room of over 100 people and felt totally relaxed and made them all laugh. And I would do it again.

Dont give up hope. The miracle will happen to you one day.

How often you want someone to come over and help is entirely dependant on the person. There are quite a few independent autistic people around. Sometimes we just need someone to push us in the right direction. Autistic people generally have a hard time doing their own household, so you get someone who helps make a schedule. It really is that easy sometimes.

It's possible to go to a special facility that provides housing and a therapist to help every now and then. You're with other autistic people there, so that's cool. Usually the waiting list for something like this is quite long. Over here it is atleast. So it's not easy to get something like this done. It's not quite permanent-permanent since the space is so limited.

It's also possible to have someone come over to your house and talk about what needs to happen. Financial administration is daunting, so is running the household like mentioned earlier. Having someone to put everything in perspective/help make phonecalls/write emails is really nice. Sometimes someone like that also helps with things not directly related to living: simple things for NT'ers I suppose.... like how to start smalltalk, how to make friends yada yada. 

Hope that helped.

It might also be wise to wait a year or two. As she gets older she will be able to control her environment more and more (teach those skills), which lowers the amount of processing required. She will come to you when she is ready for the change.

,justkeriann,,,[],,,,text,t2_11iby44j,,,"Prior to his progressing, my son was very quiet. He had a large vocabulary, but wouldn’t speak to anyone he wasn’t related to and saw in a daily basis. He couldn’t communicate emotionally at all. He didn’t participate in class. He didn’t have friends. He had a very limited diet (hello, beige foods!) where none of his food was allowed to touch ever, and had to have vitamins snuck into snacks to make up for it. He stimmed almost continuously from the moment he woke up until he went to bed, through hand flapping, verbal stimming, jumping, and neck twitching. He didn’t like to bathe, didn’t like to be touched, didn’t like music. He was incapable of participating in his own daily care outside of being able to feed himself. He couldn’t brush his own hair or teeth, wipe his own behind (although he was toilet trained at six), or wash himself. He couldn’t or wouldn’t tell you if he was hungry, tired, thirsty, or in pain. He just wanted to play with his Bakugan toys, lining them all up in toes day after day. Meltdowns were an hourly occurrence and could be triggered by just about anything and often involved him injuring himself on purpose. He required restraint to soothe him from these meltdowns, as he couldn’t self soothe. All in all he was in his own closed off little world that only a chosen few were even allowed to visit. 

Right before he turned 14 my mother in law passed. That seemed to trigger something in him. Within weeks of this incident he had an IEP meeting at school, and for the first time ever he chose to participate, which was huge. He never had shown any interest in his education before. At this meeting, he didn’t talk much, but he raised his eyebrows at ideas he approved of, and growled or stomped at one’s he didn’t. He agreed verbally to participate more in his speech therapy, which left the whole room speechless, ironically. He told us that day on the way home that he wanted to know why he had to have a special meeting. We explained his diagnosis and how it translated to things in his life. He did some research and decided he wanted to start behavioral therapy, so we found a program geared for teens on the spectrum. Flash forward nearly two years now. He is completely changed. He eats just about any and every food, and wants to be a chef and a YouTube star. He bathes and grooms himself and enjoys regular hair cuts. He talks ALL THE TIME. Even to strangers. He wipes his own butt. He plays games on the computer. He has friends. He still stimms some at night when he is starting to get tired. He not only participates in classes, he is nearly an honor student! (History bores him so he only eeked out a C in that class!) He rarely melts down anymore. When he does, it is usually closer to a teenage temper tantrum where he stomps and slams doors. He is now capable of calming himself after an episode. 

We went from planning a future that included lifelong care for our son to looking at a future where he will be mostly independent. He is expected to graduate high school and college. He has goals and friends and a girlfriend that he doesn’t call his girlfriend. While he still shows so many obvious signs and traits of ASD, he is learning to cope with them and learning to assimilate into neurotypical environments. He seems almost like a different kid. Even his teachers and aides comment on how the last couple years have brought about such drastic change. 

This isn’t the way this story goes for so many. For most, that switch doesn’t flip. We got lucky. I know that. I also know there is a chance some other event could trigger a regression that he may not be able to recover from. With ASD, there are no “typical” cases. There isn’t a clear cut path. None of us knows what tomorrow holds for us. We just have to get through today and hope we get some luck.

I belong to and autism support group for parents in my community. My child is 3 years old, and while severely speech delayed, he is a very good natured child. I fully expect that with treatment, there was no reason that he can't be mainstreamed at some point in his education.

but unfortunately, I have seen the families in the support group who have kids on the severe end of the spectrum. One mother has 2 coordinate visits to the store, the doctor, and everything else, because her 10 year old son will lash out at his younger siblings. She thinks it's because their higher-pitched voices are distressing to him.

He is constantly breaking out of the house, so they have had to spend a lot of money on alarms, and configuring safety things for their home. They have had run-ins with the police and nasty neighbors leaving notes. she is openly confess in the group that her marriage is at the breaking point and her other children are living in terror.

he has been receiving a ba in occupational therapy since he was 2 years old.

It's true that most people are probably in the middle end of the spectrum. With some support, they can leave relatively ordinary lives. But it is concerning that autism is so whitewashed in the public sphere. I think there a lot of people who assume that someone who can talk and has autism must be an autistic savant.

They think that autism is just being a little quirky. and I guess I can't fully blame people for thinking that. Because unfortunately, mothers such as the one in this piece feel that they have to hide.

I have had relatives get angry with me about getting a diagnosis for my son. Because ""he can talk, why the label?"" Because insurance won't cover any therapy without it, maybe?

Or I have had relative tell me that if I just talked to my son more, or take him to the park more, or enroll him in preschool, he won't ask so autistic.

A few years later, after a diagnosis and talking to the kids about autism, a girl came up to my wife during pickup because she was concerned about our son. You see, my son was desperate for friendship and would cling to anyone who is nice to him as if they were his best friend. A teacher saw him do this to a girl (different one than the one who came to my wife) and started telling the class that my son LOVED this girl. We warned the teacher to stop but she wouldn't listen. My son finally did what any boy in elementary school might do to prove he doesn't love an icky girl - he hit her. Obviously, that got the parents involved but thankfully that also got our son an IEP that he was being denied before.

It seems that I present the in the same way even when I'm as depressed as I can possibly get, while at the same time I'll see others completely change their composure over trivial day-to-day disturbances.

It seems the only emotion that I show enough of for people to notice is anger, which I get from very minor things, like if someone is making a repetitive noise for no reason. And I think I've heard that this sort of irrational irritation is also a symptom of autism.

And I reckon you're right as well about my autistically flat and matter of fact way of speaking probably being a large part of why people think I'm funny. It seems to be more just the delivery and the unsavouriness of my humour (rather than the cleverness) that makes people laugh.

What exactly do you mean by the last part though? Because it rings a bell, since the first psychiatrist to say I was autistic said it was because he thought the way I was speaking was too 'articulate and emotionally detached', when I was talking about an emotionally sensitive topic.

Being emotionally detached can be a part of autism, or other things. Alexithymia, where you can't really make sense of your emotions, and often not those of others, is fairly common with autism.

I actively observed people since I was about 12, realising I was different somehow and learned to modulate my behaviour. What was first conscious is now largely a subconscious skill for me. I thought if I were to be diagnosed I would be considered a borderline case.

After the specialist read my history, especially about my early development and asked me, my aunt, and my father about my behaviours and how I make sense of the world he surprised me. He said he was 99% sure I was autistic after 40 minutes of the first 90 minute diagnosis session. Apparently I should have been able to be diagnosed when I was between 3 and 5 years old.

I do well socially, but don't have much of a drive to reach out to people. I still have my quirks but my friends and family just go ""Ach, that is just Steve being Steve."" and I am accepted. Now they know why I have them.

I also have times when I can become very detached and just doggedly analyse things. I've been analysing people almost like a psychologist for nearly two decades. This has helped make up for my initial issues with social cues.

You may or may not be autistic, but you should go through a proper testing process, ideally with input from close family. Everyone on the spectrum is different, but we share one big thing in common: we perceive and filter the world and our own thoughts in ways few non-autistics do. As to the extent of that, it differs per person.

This can be stuff like finding it hard to focus on voices in a loud place, feeling overwhelmed by bright sights and loud sounds, and sometimes only some specific sounds which can even be fairly quiet. You could find it hard to locate objects you are not familiar with as your brain might do less aitomatic categorisation of things around you. For others it can be the exact opposite.

You might be surprised at what you find out about yourself and it can help you find ways to approach things differently, and help friends, family etc. to better understand you and possibly help you, like if you often find instructions vague or you feel you need to ask a lot of questions.

If they have suspicions, get a proper test done if you can. The key thing is understanding any issues you have and ways of managing them, autistic or not, and for others to understand that your brain just works a bit differently and give you some latitude and accept you, while sometimes offering friendly advice on how to approach things differently a little so that you have smoother social contact, providing you don't need to wear yourself out to do it.

,KittenTwitch,,,[],,,,text,t2_78sveh4,,,"  Aside from your sense of humor and ability to read people, what other reasons do you have to believe you're not autistic?  If there aren't many reasons, then I would consider the possibility that you are in denial.  That's not uncommon with people who were recently diagnosed as teens/adults, because there's a lot that you have to accept in accepting the diagnosis (things like the fact that there's resources out there that you only have access to now despite always needing them, etc.). 
  
  IMO, reading people is actually really easy provided I actually look at the person's face.  People are predictable, and just because you aren't born with a native's intuition doesn't mean you can't figure it out.  Plus, we on the spectrum sometimes give neurotypical people a little too much social credit-they're just as capable of messing up as we are, it just gets chalked up to social awkwardness rather than a developmental/sensory processing disorder.  
  
  In my entirely unprofessional and unqualified opinion, you, person I have never met in person, are on the spectrum based on what you've told me.  The fact that you're bipolar (known for the feeling *and expression* of extreme emotion) and people still say that your tone is flat is a pretty big indicator.  That means that you don't just have flat voice when you're in a neutral mood, it means you have a flat voice when you're really, really angry or depressed.  Most people don't do that.  In part because most people don't do that, the flat tone itself can be kind funny-it's so out of place that it surprises people and makes them think you're not super serious (or that you have a lot of control).  
  
  Finally, you write in a way that's giving me some autistic vibes.  Formal, big words, syntax that sounds less vernacular and more ""people can say it this way but they usually don't"", etc.  Not a guarantee, but definitely correlates.

The things on your legs feeling is interesting, my son also hates socks. And the threads inside. 

Home schooling sounds like a feasible option on one hand for you, but on the other hand you are missing out on specialist career guidance people and socialising opportunities. I mean things you are struggling with such as routine and motivation to study, there are people whose job it is to help with that (pastoral care, teachers in general). You're trying to do something on your own that other kids find difficult with all that extra help. 

That student mentor was probably only trying to help. I suppose it's part of a support system. 


People put their foot in it a lot, rather than using words like 'you might feel more comfortable', or 'part of the school family' it came out as 'YOU ARE NOT NORMAL, WHY DON'T YOU TRY TO BE NORMAL?' It's not her fault, she was wrong but didn't mean to offend you. You were experiencing extreme anxiety and going through a sensory overload meltdown. It's not your fault either. 

It's a shame that you feel you couldn't take the GCSE'S I'm guessing this is because you can't take them at home. You're gonna have to go into school. Here's a link to Oxford home schooling, they explain that basically you have a disadvantage if you need to ask for assistance such as extra time or breaks because the teachers in the school don't know you.

But within what capacity they do have for self control at a certain age, just as much as a NT child can be bad so can a child with autism. To me it seems some adults want to avoid being a 'bad guy' and saying something is bad, as if things will work out when we avoid that. It's simply an over reaction in the other direction - where calling something bad can be missplaced and damaging as a result, avoiding saying anything is bad can just as much be missplaced as well and even damaging to an autistic child's development. Like children cry when we give them a vaccination and yet that is for a greater benefit *despite the crying*, some things are called bad. The issue is the self control of a child with autism might be far lower than an NT and be misidentified as bad behavior when the child can no more control themselves than a child with Tourette's syndrome can clamp down on their words.

Although there are certain phrases, if you will, that mask assumed evil intent, and the recognition of that assumed intent being a measure of the intelligence of the listener, I would say that there is no phrase that cannot be taken to have bad intent.

In the above phrase I imagine that someone gets offended, thus feels attacked, so, feels that evil intent, because the phrase can be taken to imply a passive-aggressive suggestion. So that *if it does not make sense, this says something about the listener*. They question mark can be taken to have the hidden meaning of putting the listener on the spot: if you get it, then it is fine, but if you don't you must not be bright.

We were constantly in meetings with teachers to try and get me into class, make it more comfortable, etc. I also had really bad issues with my uniform, I ended up wearing my PE shirt constantly, a skirt and sandals with nothing else on my legs in winter, no socks, etc. I eventually managed to wear socks when I was 12 ish but I have to turn them inside out and cut the corners off.

When I reached High school I was absolutely adamant that I was not going. Especially considering the uniform was trousers or a skirt with tights and I couldn’t stand things on my legs.
My mum contacted some of social service, anxiety women and she’d just come in and talk to me and things and I eventually started going.
It was the same thing all year, constant days off, meetings, that sort of thing.
I eventually got referred to camhs (cahms?? I can never remember which way it is), though I pretended I was okay since I hated going and got discharged.

I finished my first year in high school with extremely bad social anxiety and one friend.
The entire summer I was the same, completely refusing to go the next year.

I was extremely anxious the entire first day, didn’t eat, didn’t drink, didn’t use the toilet, and waited till everyone left and then left school so no one else saw me.
The next day I got to school and I refused to go into the classroom (I’d always tested my mum and been a little brat, but never spoken back against a teacher of been in trouble or anything), I backed myself into the corner crying and told them if they touched me to force me into the classroom I wouldn’t hesitate to hit them. Eventually they agreed to let me sit alone in a room for the next two days.

Though there is something I mention every time I tell someone about this, what the student mentor said to me when I got took to a room by myself. She said ‘As soon as you get back into the classroom, you can become a normal member of society again.’
A normal member of society. I’ve never been a bad person at school but I honestly couldn’t describe the disbelief I felt when she said that. Basically telling me I wasn’t a ‘normal’ member of society.

After the two days, it was the weekend and I said there was no way I was going back. I wasn’t eating, I wasn’t sleeping, I wasn’t drinking, because of the anxiety, so my parents decided to take me out for my health. 

My homeschooling started off great, but I’m definitely extremely behind my peers because of how many days of school I missed. I have a really hard time concentrating the last couple years so I find it really hard to do my work and sometimes accidentally skip days at the time as I’m completely forgetting, the same with eating and drinking....my socialisation has definitely decreased too. I’m extremely anxious in public and barely leave the house, I also only have one (kind of two) online friend now.

I’m slowly starting to get back into the habit of doing my work every day, but I know there’s no way I can go take my GCSEs or go back into a school. I physically couldn’t. 

This is honestly really embarrassing but a massive part of my anxiety is a bit of a toilet phobia...I’m terrified of anyone hearing me go to the toilet, which results in me getting anxious about needing the toilet, so I need to go to the toilet. I also have an EXTREME phobia of accidentally farting in front of someone...to the point it’s turned into an actual phobia and affects most of my life. 
There’s things I want to do, like I want to go out to the cinema to watch a new movie, but I’m too terrified I’ll start needing the toilet and not manage to get out on time. It’s an extremely irrational phobia but it’s literally ruling and ruining my life.

The best emails in the world can’t fix and prevent real world issues. So while this email hit all the points in regards to communicating the situation the real work is what happens in person. 

Which makes me think that this kind of news would be better in person or on the phone. Furthermore this could be a good time to fix the relationship with the mother in law given her expertise. If she sees this email especially saying about the team taking care of your child, she will probably freak and say “well what about my opinion on the matter?!” You could use this as an opportunity to make your MIL part of the team that helps you make your child has successful and happy as possible.

[],gibcatboyspls,,,[],,,,text,t2_41t2lqfr,False,,"Wow. This comment is absolutely beautiful. One of my most obscure hard-to-describe special interests is actually the universe and any philosophy and theories related to it and this comment really made me feel. Thank you so much for taking the time to write that, it's stunning.

And I agree completely. Apart from this I'm generally not an emotional person at all (which seems like a huge contradiction haha) but I really, really dislike how this current society prefers jadedness and an 'I-don't-care' attitude over practicing love and kindness and an appreciation for the everyday things that make life possible. I really dislike how it's seen as weird or odd or childish to care for the things around you and how society sees people that do so.

The other major problem is: “what exactly do you ‘cure’”? For me, the autism’s impacts are highly contained in nurture; curing would be literal mind control and a denial of my past.

He sounds like he gets enough protein (and TBH if you eat animal products at all, you do, most people don't realize this), and if he's eating fruit he gets some vitamins. You can always give a multivitamin if you're worried. Your kid's diet isn't going to ""stunt his brain development"" or bring about the end of the world as some ""natural"" bloggers would like you to believe. 

Years of people trying to actively get me to try new foods has left me with anxiety around eating, and I'm now unable to eat around other people without becoming very anxious. Many people who have developed serious business eating disorders have also reported that family members or friends were on their case about their eating habits prior to developing the disorder. I did best trying new foods when people weren't trying to make me do it. If I was with friends (I honestly felt deeply uncomfortable doing so with my family) and there was a new food I might have eaten it because I knew my friends wouldn't comment on it at all. Even praise for trying a new food was anxiety inducing. 

Just put food out and let them try it, quietly take notes on whether they keep coming back to eat it and then you can offer it more. Don't comment on it.

If you do have autism, then getting a diagnosis might mean that later on when you're an adult you can pursue benefits that will help you. If you end up struggling to keep a job because of your symptoms and can't support yourself, there's help for you if you're diagnosed. But without a diagnosis you/they can't do anything about it.

That aside, your life isn't falling apart. It's important to remember that nothing has changed at all. If you have autism now, you always did, and the world didn't end. If you don't have autism or it's something else, then you never had autism and the world didn't end.

But again, that is my point of view, and I'm not trying to convert anyone to my way of thinking.

I mean I understand why they don't like the idea of it, but take this example. If there was something that came out, that helped manage things like overstimulation, shutdowns, etc. why wouldn't you take it, even if it ""took away"" your autism.

,gshhpy,,,,2c12fa88-32ca-11e5-958c-0e184320b869,Adult Autistic,,,t2_cq08g,,,"That happened to me around her age for the same reason. I was fortunate enough to find an occupational therapist who specialized in sensory integration and deep pressure input therapy when I was 16 and it helped immensely.


 I suffer so much from the lasting effects of trauma from my sensory issues, and traumatic events that resulted in more agoraphobia, but I the deep pressure input helps me cope with my heightened sensory issues, anxiety, depression and ptsd now. I'm still not ideal when it comes to agoraphobia and being a shut in but I'm so much better off now than I ever was and it's not too late for your daughter like it is for me since so much other things happened to me. 

For whatever reasons for some people with autism our senses are unfiltered.  And it's far more than just sound. Literally every sense, and there's far more than just 5. For example, when I was a child I had a great difficulty with heights so I couldn't walk up stairs in public buildings that you could see the lower floors through without having sensory overloads. Sunny days are horrible, too many moving cars and traffic while I'm walking is horrible. Etc. But deep pressure input helps counterbalance this for some reason. Deep pressure input can be received through three main things, weight, pressure and vibrations. They make specialty weighted blankets online to sleep with or put over your shoulders. Heavy lifting can help, like with actual weight lifting with weights you can buy or even doing it seriously at the gym, or moving things, and things like back massagers and long car rides can provide vibrations. I love long car rides, and there are two people in my family who go for car rides for hours and hours. You basically have to use deep pressure whenever you're on your down time and it calms you down and lessens the unfiltered sensory issues. Once you get used to recognizing when you need deep pressure input it becomes a primary need, as intrinsic as knowing when you're hungry to eat. We have a lot of issues that stem from the lack of deep pressure input, like I used to walk on my heels, bad posture, anxiety, depression, restlessness, sleep issues, and agoraphobia. I used to run around constantly as a kid and I would jump off the top of my stairs which ended up spraining my ankle a few times. 

I believe you can do this therapy on your own through research and simply buying a weighted blanket, but there's help out there with occupational therapists. I've posted about deep pressure a lot in the past if you dig through my post history you might find more information I've posted here.  I was just talking to someone the other day about big weighted blankets we use to sleep. If you google deep pressure input and weighted blankets there's a lot of information out there. If you have any questions feel free to ask. 

Also eprsonally I use a 30 lbs weighted blanket. The formula is 10 percent of your body weight plus one pound AT LEAST, but I'm 150 pounds and like a 30 pound one to sleep with. And I have a 15 pound one that goes over my shoulders and I love long car rides.

You can also do this in conjunctioning with everything else you're doing. But right now you're only treating the symptom and not the cause. 


I still have bad days if I don't get enough DPI and things happen in life that I can't control but it doesn't lead to meltdowns that are so severe I'm in hysterics and punching myself like when I was a kid, and it helps me cope with being outside. Especially when I am able to drive for long amounts of time in periods of my life because that is exposure therapy for agoraphobia too + calming deep pressure input that makes me feel safe everywhere.

Oh and if you ever get to hte point where she can go to an amusement park it's so much deep pressure input I can't even explain. I was nervous around crowds, when in this thing that spun you around a lot that I could actually walk on MASSIVE stairs that was attached to a giants lidea nd go to a live concert with massive, massive, massive speakers and giant crowds. But from the time I was a kid to your daughter's age before I had  a weighted blankaet I was extremely afraid of everything  at an amusement park and never knew why. All the moving things and sounds and people...but it turned out to be so much deep pressure.

And also normal people love deep pressure input too, like dancing, and hugs and pacing and chewing gum. it's something everyone needs to calm down but for whatever reason we need more because our senses are screwed up. 

I hope this helped. ",1522963992,,dwvlbpz,False,t3_8a2oaw,,True,t3_8a2oaw,/r/autism/comments/8a2oaw/autism_and_agoraphobia/dwvlbpz/,1526007863,4,True,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,1522964270.0,,1376267882.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,7819.0,,public,,,False,,,,,

,amefeu,,,,,,,,t2_mvcbp,,,"It depends on how you want to classify what is or isn't a disability. It's like going through life as a left handed person. Everything is made for right handed people. Even simple things like holding a pair of scissors. That's how it feels like it is to be on the spectrum. The world is made to function for the more normal people of the world. Most ""cures"" want to make us more normal. To us it feels no different then how they used to punish children for writing with their left hand. The majority of my issues are around the requirements to socialize. Outside that main area I've got virtually few other issues. Several other areas seem to be enhanced because of this lack of being able to socialize intuitively. Like if I was blind my hearing would increase. However it isn't a super power. It's my body adapting to the environment as best as it can. Like many who are blind or deaf don't want to be cured I don't want a ""cure"" either. I would be happy for anyone who has ASD wanted such a thing. However I fear that society would removeus as ""imperfections"" particularly those who are parents and have children with ASD or adults with ASD who cannot communicate for themselves. Those without a choice and without a voice. It's why I fear most cures would be a prenatal test and neurodiversity would be eliminated. I fear that cures would destroy those who accept them. That all of the ""negatives"" of autism is in fact a shield thrown up against the world. Even if all those concerns are taken into account. It would take years for anyone who got the cure to be able to function. We grew up this way and we learned no other way to deal with the world. We would have to take training to fully get us to become NTs. A cure at best can only remove the wall in the way. I am neither rogue nor am I storm. ([in reference to a photo that goes around where rogue wants the cure and storm doesn't](http://i.imgur.com/7pvLIBh.jpg)) I am Professor Xavier.

She was actually really welcoming and I got to tour the classroom and ask about what to expect during the ARD.  We got to talk about what services are offered at the school and I talked to them about what therapies we were doing at home.  

The ARD felt more like a formality because they just went through the autism screening report and that they would be providing speech and OT. and PPCD half a day.  Speech is once a week and OT once every few weeks on a consultative basis.  I think it's a good thing that my son is only having a few months before summer so that we can see how things are working and whether we need to make any changes the following school year so it feels kind of like a trial run.

,EldritchAutomaton,,,,,,,,t2_ncmapvz,,,"So I guess this just affirms 'love' as being nothing more as a label slapped onto to a spectrum of feelings. I can work with that definition as oppose to someone saying, ""It's just a feeling."" Still, it definitely is a fascinating subject since it is such an unknown feeling to me. Though now that I think about, it may not be as unknown as I initially thought it to be, as I recall one situation in my past that has illicit extremely strong feelings that could be close to what someone might describe as love.

When I was a kid, probably eight or nine years of age, my parents got me a cat. It was a beautiful black cat that I named Midnight. Midnight was in all seriousness, the best pet I have ever owned. I raised her as a kitten, and I was only the person that she allowed to pick up without scratching the ever loving hell out of anyone else. Now, as a child with autism, I am sure you can understand the significance of having a friend that doesn't judge or care what you have, especially since I had trouble making friends and everyone around me at the time considered me extremely odd. I think that is why me and Midnight meshed so well together can I've been described as having a very independent, cat like personality. Anyways, we would play together, sleep together, annoy each other, etc. It was fantastic, because everyone knew that Midnight was MY cat and MY cat alone. 

Then one day we moved homes. We went from California to Florida, and for some reason I still don't have an answer to, we left Midnight behind with another owner, while we kept the dogs. I still remember how I felt back then, it was absolute feeling of loss and confusion. Like a limb was ripped off. I was depressed for months. I remember sobbing uncontrollably in my grandmothers lap for hours as she tried to console me. 

Apparently, that feeling of loss was so strong that no joke, I woke up in the middle of the night a few months ago...in my late 20's with tears streaming down my face after a dream about Midnight. It was a weird feeling, because I was still very neutral when I woke up. Like, I wasn't in distress or anything, but tears fell regardless while my mind registered that I was thinking about Midnight. I still harbor feelings of loss from that event for a cat almost 2 decades ago that it still causes an intense feeling of sorrow whenever my mind wanders that far back. So would it then be safe to say that I loved my cat since it manages to harbor such strong emotions?",1526576379,,dz50yc0,True,t3_8k4dk3,,True,t1_dz4z6ua,/r/autism/comments/8k4dk3/can_someone_explain_love_to_me/dz50yc0/,1527579609,4,True,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,,,1513607849.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,2.0,1560.0,,public,,,False,,,,,

I think this is as valid a way to think of it as any. I think the intensity of it varies depending on one's own level of passion -- with you being a person of all-around neutral disposition, it makes sense that your attachment to things is equally neutral. Or, as you say, maybe one day you'll meet a person who somehow manages to trigger a more intense emotional response -- it's always possible but I don't think holding out for that is any more logical than just accepting one's current intensity level.

I don't think there's an exact feeling that you can point to and say ""that's it, that's love"", either. (People do that all the time, obviously, but I wonder if they're pointing to just a general warm-fuzzy feeling and considering that the whole of it.) Love can also be seen as a practice, a system of behaviour, which is how I look at it. The things I do for the people I'm in relationships with are loving practices, even if there are no warm-fuzzy emotional responses behind them -- I do them because I'm invested in those people's lives. (Why? Because they provide me with things I need, either mentally or physically, so I do the same in return in whatever capacity I can. That sounds like a callous way to put it, but I really don't think it's all that callous. I think people just don't want to say it like that.)

With non-people, I say I love whatever makes me feel happy at the time, honestly. Like video games. Hell yeah, I love Elder Scrolls Online, it's a special interest! What else is that but love?! :p

It /is/ a fascinating subject to think about, but I do think that sometimes a mountain is made out of molehill in the case of love. There's probably as many ways to love as there are ways to be human, which is /part/ of what makes it so fascinating.

I'd say loving someone is similar to caring for someone, , but much more emotionally driven. When you love something, then it means that it gives you a feeling you can't really get anywhere else when you do it (for actions) or are near it or interact with it (objects and people) and have memories associated with it. For example you might love your home because it makes you feel safe and comfy, you feel like nothing can happen to you at home, and that's a feeling that a comfy chair or a secured room can give you, because it's not your home. In your home you have so many things, some more useful, some less so, but more often than not they are associated with a memory, and even if you feel insecure, you can just look around and find something that reminds you of a wonderful memory, giving you that feeling of security and comfortability again.

Something similar could apply to your mother if you love her. You might feel safe when near her, happy and understood, feelings very few people can give you. You can also dwell in memories with her in it, which can give you various feelings, life the security, the understanding, the happiness, and maybe even other feelings, but all feel so good, and you know that there are more memories to come.

Things we love change us, they make us feel in a unuqie way. An artist draws to create and feel a new world, enjoying the wild process of creating it, you feel how the world comes alive in your mind, as if you are not creating a picture, but a portal. And every time you look back at it, you dive again into this world, seeing what you created, feeling the feelings you put into it.

I could go on and on with how you can love various things, because you can't really love one thing like you can love the other, which is why most people propably try to struggle explaining it in a short bit. But I'll stop here because I don't want to spend too much time on this post.

One of the things that spurred me to start looking deeply into it was a tendency I have to make a faux pas, then make it worse and worse the more I tried to make it better.

With my wife (whose feelings I hurt many times), we've been able to come to the realization that sometimes, I just need to take a moment to try to calm my buzzing brain after one of these missteps, and that it's perfectly legitimate for me to say something like, ""I'm sorry, I'm not processing right now."" Because a lot of what happens with me is that, in the flood of emotions I get after realizing I hurt her feelings, I tend to enter fight (get defensive) or flight (go quiet) mode. So when it's bad, I'm sort of a frantic mess repeating ""I'm sorry"" and ""What I actually meant was..."" But then, as M_SunChilde points out, she usually forgets the incident before I do — unless I keep reminding her and dragging it out by way of trying to make it right.

That all might not be super helpful in terms of relating with your coworkers better, but I do think that it's likely that the incident bothered you a lot more than it bothered them. And it's not fair for your coworkers to have called you out like that in front of so many people, especially if they are aware of your diagnosis. I'm sorry that happened to you.

I got massively stressed and burned out just trying to figure out what the right thing to do was, even for small things.  
  
I saw a counsellor who gave me some good advice.  He said to stop trying to be good for everyone because that's not possible.  He told me to pick a couple of really trusted people who loved me and were decent people in themselves and then think about what advice they would give for any particular decision.  Then go with that.  He told me that there will always be people who disagree with any decision I make but if the loving trusted people would be OK with something then you can ignore all of that.  I found that this really helped because it made choosing things and deciding actions much easier because I wasn't faced with the impossible task of pleasing everyone.

Somethings going to have to change.

My daughter's half his age but when her school refused to make accommodations for her (pre diagnosis) I ended up moving her to another school. Best decision ever. They treat her as an individual.

Last year at her old school I chose to keep her home for three days because she was headed for exclusion and needed a break.

In the meantime you could try and help him find balance and enjoyment from other interests, exercise or whatever restores him.

We don't have an IEP or anything yet but a document outlining the school's non negotiables, what allowances they can make e.g. extensions for assignments and what really doesn't matter would be really useful.

I know nothing of your school system but could you sit down with the school and your son and develop something like that?

All parties sign it and abide by it, hopefully taking some pressure off your boy and the teaching staff who may be unsure what they can reasonably expect. 

If the school won't budge, maybe look for an advocate of some sort?

I'm sure someone with more relevant experience will have more useful suggestions.

I should have kept to my gut knowing he might get disrupted before he saw me and let the aids know to leave him be and for us to stick in the background. It was like I suddenly felt like I knew nothing and didn’t know what to do surrounded by teachers and aids whom have more experience. And I do know though, that despite all the things and I’m only learning about ASD, I know my son. And I *knew* he would have been better off if we stayed observing. 

This is all new for us. It was months of testing just to get him into the preschool and it was not for the entire year. His main issue, aside from needing routine, is his lack of talking for the most part. I definitely saw improvement with the few short months. He went from not attempting to talk to now attempting most often. He still pulls us around a lot. 

I will definitely work on a visual calendar. At home it seemed he was flexible with most things and the main routine he required was for bedtime duties and around meals somewhat and. As it never disrupted him for us to go to the store and such at random times. Even random activities around the house never bothered him. I have two older boys whom aren’t special needs and they make things more chaotic mostly and unless they become ill tempered, they don’t disrupt him really. So it somewhat surprised me how much he has become dependent on the routines at school so much. 

They did, in the classroom, have a little book with pictures for him to let them know what he wanted. And he was getting better at it , they said. They did not instruct me to have one for home, although I asked, but they did not give me his so I need to create a new one somehow for the summertime I suppose. 

This journey will be long and I’m learning a lot about the spectrum, not only with him but also in myself I was unaware about and much of my moms side of the family. Thank you for all your advice.

Activation of the Maternal Immune System During
Pregnancy Alters Behavioral Development of Rhesus
Monkey Offspring

Melissa D. Bauman, Ana-Maria Iosif, Stephen E.P. Smith, Catherine Bregere, David G. Amaral, and Paul H. Patterson

Background: Maternal infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia and autism in the offspring. Supporting this correlation, experimentally activating the maternal immune system during pregnancy in rodents produces offspring with abnormal brain and behavioral development. We have developed a nonhuman primate model to bridge the gap between clinical populations and rodent models of maternal immune activation (MIA).

Methods: A modified form of the viral mimic, synthetic double-stranded RNA (polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid stabilized with poly-L-lysine) was delivered to two separate groups of pregnant rhesus monkeys to induce MIA: 1) late first trimester MIA (n 1⁄4 6), and 2) late second trimester MIA (n 1⁄4 7). Control animals (n 1⁄4 11) received saline injections at the same first or second trimester time points or were untreated. Sickness behavior, temperature, and cytokine profiles of the pregnant monkeys confirmed a strong inflammatory response to MIA.

Results: Behavioral development of the offspring was studied for 24 months. Following weaning at 6 months of age, MIA offspring exhibited abnormal responses to separation from their mothers. As the animals matured, MIA offspring displayed increased repetitive behaviors and decreased affiliative vocalizations. When evaluated with unfamiliar conspecifics, first trimester MIA offspring deviated from species-typical macaque social behavior by inappropriately approaching and remaining in immediate proximity of an unfamiliar animal.

Conclusions: In this rhesus monkey model, MIA yields offspring with abnormal repetitive behaviors, communication, and social interactions. These results extended the findings in rodent MIA models to more human-like behaviors resembling those in both autism and schizophrenia.

Maternal immune activation yields offspring displaying mouse versions of the three core symptoms of autism

Natalia V. Malkova*, Collin Z. Yu, Elaine Y. Hsiao, Marlyn J. Moore, and Paul H. Patterson Biology Division, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125

Abstract
The core symptoms of autism are deficits in social interaction and language, and the presence of repetitive/stereotyped behaviors. We demonstrate that behaviors related to these symptoms are present in a mouse model of an environmental risk factor for autism, maternal infection. We stimulate the maternal immune system by injecting the viral mimic poly(I:C) during pregnancy, and analyze the social and communicative behaviors of the offspring. In one test, young pups respond to a brief separation from the mother with ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). We find that, compared to pups born to saline-injected mothers, pups born to maternal immune activation (MIA) mothers produce a lower rate of USVs in the isolation test starting at day 8. The quality of the vocalizations is also different; analysis of sound spectrograms of ten day-old pups shows that male pups from MIA mothers emit significantly fewer harmonic and more complex and short syllables. These communication differences are also apparent in adult offspring. Compared to controls, adult MIA males emit significantly fewer USVs in response to social encounters with females or males, and display reduced scent marking in response to female urine. Regarding a second autism symptom, MIA males display decreased sociability. In a third test of characteristic autism behaviors, MIA offspring exhibit increased repetitive/stereotyped behavior in both marble burying and self-grooming tests. In sum, these results indicate that MIA yields male offspring with deficient social and communicative behavior, as well as high levels of repetitive behaviors, all of which are hallmarks of autism.

Maternal Immune Activation Alters Fetal Brain Development through Interleukin-6

Abstract

Schizophrenia and autism are thought to result from the interaction between a susceptibility genotype and environmental risk factors. The offspring of women who experience infection while pregnant have an increased risk for these disorders. Maternal immune activation (MIA) in pregnant rodents produces offspring with abnormalities in behavior, histology, and gene expression that are reminiscent of schizophrenia and autism, making MIA a useful model of the disorders. However, the mechanism by which MIA causes long-term behavioral deficits in the offspring is unknown. Here we show that the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is critical for mediating the behavioral and transcriptional changes in the offspring. A single maternal injection of IL-6 on day 12.5 of mouse pregnancy causes prepulse inhibition (PPI) and latent inhibition (LI) deficits in the adult offspring. Moreover, coadministration of an anti-IL-6 antibody in the poly(I:C) model of MIA prevents the PPI, LI, and exploratory and social deficits caused by poly(I:C) and normalizes the associated changes in gene expression in the brains of adult offspring. Finally, MIA in IL-6 knock-out mice does not result in several of the behavioral changes seen in the offspring of wild-type mice after MIA. The identification of IL-6 as a key intermediary should aid in the molecular dissection of the pathways whereby MIA alters fetal brain development, which can shed new light on the pathophysiological mechanisms that predispose to schizophrenia and autism.

I thought I would weigh in here to maybe offer an idea of how this may be handled, because commonly, it simply isn't. This kind of social mistake happens often amongst all types of people. While it can prey on the mind for some time when we make the mistake, typically the others involved won't be thinking about it a day or two from when it happened. Our ideas about someone are normally built around many interactions built over some time, and while this incident may feel very pertinent to you right now, to the person it happened with, it will fairly shortly just form a small part of their overall concept of you. While it can be disappointing to have this 'black mark' there, often the best response is just to learn from it and continue on as though it didn't happen.  
   
Quite often I have seen more damage caused from trying to repair something small that happened, which mostly only serves to reinforce the event in the mind of the others involved.    
   
I hope this advice isn't misplaced, and best of luck going forward. Remember that making a mistake like this doesn't decrease your value or goodness as a person. It was just that: a mistake; and the world still wants you out here interacting with us.

If you have a 5 below store by you, you can find a ton of great items there at a low price.  We got a hammock chair there for $5 and hung it up in the room from one of the studs in the ceiling.  Half of our room has mats on the floor.  We have yoga balls, a tent that we filled with giant stuffed animals that he likes to go in and roll around in.  He responds really well to pressure.  We have a slide, a little scooter board, a balance board and a spinning board.  We also have a giant bean bag from pottery barn that’s a great crash pad.  We also roll him up in it like a little taco and he just loves it.  At one point we had an inflatable pool filled with plastic balls that he loved to jump in to.  

I will say that we didn’t get all the items for his room all at once.  We did a little at a time and as he gets older it keeps changing with him.  Sometimes an item won’t work so we’ll put it away in the garage and when we take it out a few months later sometimes we’re surprised to see how much he loves it.  One thing that we also did was set up a wish list for sensory items we thought he might like on amazon.

http://neurowonderful.tumblr.com/autismmasterpost

So some short tidbits, but you should really try to read the masterpost in its entirety:

- OT is good, ABA, well, many autistic adults aren't fans. ABA has personally caused me and many others serious mental health issues as well as made me an extreme ""doormat"" in relationships to the point where I have experienced relationship abuse because every time I wanted to say no, I would hear my therapist in my head saying ""be flexible"". DIR/Floortime is a therapy I recommend. 

- The best way to handle meltdowns is to attempt to prevent them. Look for things that trigger them and try to avoid those situations, learn to read his signals that a meltdown might be coming and then get him out of there. In the midst of an actual meltdown, priority one should be getting him to a physically safe location, but then try to minimize touching him unless he initiates it or you have his consent to do so. While I like being touched (by certain people that don't happen to be my family members) when I am upset, a lot of us actually become more stressed when we are being touched during meltdowns, it makes us feel trapped. This means no hugs unless he indicates he wants one. Also, don't talk a lot or ask questions during, that's just stressful for us to process during that time. When he's a little older it might help to talk to him about what he feels helps him during meltdowns, when he isn't actually having a meltdown, this way you can develop a ""meltdown plan"" for things like touching, comfort objects, talking, etc.

- A really good parenting blog for autistic kids I like is called Michelle Sutton Writes. 

- Seek counseling for yourself. Counseling will help you become a better parent by finding healthy ways to manage your stress levels without ""unloading"" onto your son or other people not equipped to handle it.

It took me like years to get over my grandmother dying, and I felt much similar to you. I feel like the closer someone is to me, the harder it is to actually let myself grieve about it.

For me I just kind of went with my daily routine like I always did. I felt numb for a while, but then after that I started to process it. So I would actually say to go through the motions, as shitty as that sounds. I also was frustrated by my lack of processing during the memorial and funeral.

You don't have to say anything at the funeral. Don't feel like you're expecting to do or express anything like that. No one should put pressure on someone to perform at a funeral. A funeral is for everyone to congregate and deal with their grief however they may (even if that grief comes a lot later, like a year later).

,kendylou,,,,,,,,t2_7pu48,,,"My son is autistic and I use this sub to try to understand him and his experiences since he’s still fairly young and doesn’t express himself as well as most kids. I’m trying to make the best possible outcome for my child and this is one of the myriad of ways I’m doing that. 

The rhetoric that you’re referring to is that it’s hard to raise a child who has differences? It’s hard to raise children anyway and if your child is fundamentally different and the world isn’t made for them you get that times ten. We need support and understanding not gatekeeping and exclusion. 

My son is very high functioning in most ways, but god damn if it still isn’t difficult on a day to day basis just to get him educated, teach him to find friends for himself or at the very least not make himself a complete social outcast. I count myself  lucky compared to parents who have kids who can’t take care of their own basic needs and never will. It’s a tragedy for those people who never signed up for a lifetime of toddler-level care. I think you need to put yourself in their shoes for a minute and try to understand the level of grief and in turn guilt that they feel. 

Am I saying they should get to murder or abuse their kids? Of course not! Once your baby is born it’s your responsibility to give them the best chance at life that you can. Frequently for parents like me that means giving up a lot of what you wanted for your own life. Not to mention, feeling every bit of the pain your child feels when the world is unkind and unfair. Still, I love my son even with the pain, the guilt, the fear there’s so much to love about him and I would never trade him for any other child.

,Ganjalf_of_Sweeden,,,,,,,,t2_1ei568,,,"Smoking 2 grams of cannabis a day is a lot. Have you tried taking a tolerance break?   
Daily cannabis use will down regulate the endocannabinoid system in your body and that could exacerbate depression. Try taking a break for at least two weeks to let your body recuperate.

Periodically I too use cannabis, but at most 500 milligram (half a gram) a day.  
I want to be functional and not just sink down in the couch stoned out of my mind, I make sure that my cannabis use is medicinal (and spiritual) and not something I use just to escape. I usually vape or eat it as that is not as rough on the lungs as smoking tends to be.  
Eating it prolongs the effect, up to 8-10 hours in my experience (makes the onset take longer too though, up to an hour-1 1/2 hour) while vaping makes it easier to get the dosage right (I use a scale to measure how much I use) and I feel an effect for about 4 hours.

I also find that strains with different ratios of CBD:THC have different effects. My experience is that a high CBD : low THC strain works wonders on anxiety and I seem to easier filter out noise which makes social interaction a lot easier and it improves my ability to plan and organise. I would recommend you to check out CBD-oil, it has a really low amount of THC so it will not down regulate your endocannabinoid system as much as using cannabis with higher content of THC would.

It does not mean you didn't love your grandmother less. It doesnt mean youre not sad. It doesn't mean youre not grieving. It just means you're tired. 

Actually not being able to sleep will cause you to feel emotionally numb and all sorts of horrible things like surreal feelings. Trust me I have been sleep deprived this entire month. 

You're autistic and routine and structure is he most important thing for us. So you doing everything normally is just you trying to cope with great stress and grief. Don't feel guilty about this.


You need to just accept that you feel the way you do. It is all normal. And it will all pass. It's like going through a storm right now, but you just need to accept that you feel how you feel. Don't fight it and get angry at yourself. In fact the angst you have at yourself makes it pretty obvious you're grieving too. Just accept you are pissed too, and numb and everything else. 


I actually had a friend who seemed to act and do the exact same things when his mother passed, but he told me he was grieving in his personal time but otherwise he wanted to do everything else normally.

There's other things you can do too. You get deep pressure input three majornways. Weight, pressure and vibration.

Wrapping up in a towel to hug yourself, rocking chairs etc. Running can help but it doesn't give enough for me.

,Mdlusk,,,,,,,,t2_entbyam,,,"Even though there is kind of a guide through the stages of grief, everyone deals with it a different way. The best thing you could do for yourself is let your emotions flow the way they want to and let time do its healing. For some like myself, that devastated feeling just causes numbness for a while and then the crying and depression set in. It's hypocritical for me to say but try your best not to hold your emotions in because that will just prolong your suffering and multiply it tenfold. My grandmother passed away 4 years ago and I'm still not over it, I just keep it out of my mind until I go and spend time with her at the cemetery. Just know you're not alone in this and make sure you don't completely isolate yourself whether you talk to your friends in person, play a game with other people online or continue posting on here. After the funeral is over and done with try to focus on what else makes you happy, I don't know what kind of hobbies you're in to but it helps soften the blow when you're doing something you like. For me it's primarily weightlifting and intense cardio that eases a lot of pain and I suggest you try it out if you're not already. The main thing I'm trying to get at is that everyone handles grief a different way, so don't think of yourself as weird for feeling the way you do. I hope the funeral goes well and if you're going to speak just talk about the things you guys loved to do together and she'll be missed. It's normal for people to be sad at funerals so even if you can't say a whole lot without getting really emotional at least your grandmother knows that the love you had for her was deep.

,CAGreyson,,,,,,,,t2_13frod,,,"Let my first start off by saying I'm sorry for everything that you have had to go through.I never had a sibling with autism, however, my mother was highly abusive and was bi-polar. Coming from someone that has been hauntingly close to where you are, let me offer some of my own ways of coping that really helped. 

Thankfully, you are young when you were diagnosed! I wasn't diagnosed until I was well into my adult years. My family had no idea what was 'wrong with me'. I struggled all throughout school, but high school was probably the worst. 

With drug use at this age, it's not good. My major was neuroscience and let me break it down for you: 

Your brain has not developed enough to be altering it with chemicals that will cause a lasting effect. Depression and marijuana these days are often just tossed together as a cure-all. As someone mentioned, don't buy into that. Especially in males, the brain takes longer to fully develop. Most people's pre-frontal cortex (the part of the brain that weighs risk vs. reward to simplify it) is not done developing until 23-25. 

This means that you are self-medicating and you should rather go talk to a doctor to check out other options. If the marijuana is helping, see if there is something similar to this that can help without the effects on the brain that is occurring. 

The numbness you speak of is depression, however, has this started happening more with the heavier use of smoking? Like Spectre mentioned, this could be making it worse. I've struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. It never completely goes away, but it helps to be self-aware and know how to help your symptoms.

 Things that have really helped me is an exercise of any sort. I try to make it fun and change it up if I get bored. During warmer seasons, I absolutely love getting out on my bike and listening to audiobooks. Something about the repetitive motion of the bike is calming and I can control it. 

What are things you enjoy? Certain music that calms you? For me, it's classical, metal, or certain types of rap/pop. Find something that really makes you happy here and sync it with something physical. 

Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. 

I CANNOT stress enough how important a sleep cycle is to you. Especially right now, and being where you are at mentally. Please try and make it a daily routine to not only get enough sleep, but fall asleep at the same time every night. The brain needs this to repair and to store long-term and short-term memory. 

Food as well. Make sure that you are eating properly and if you can't, try vitamins. I make it a game every morning to take it the same exact time every day! :) 

With the arguing, I suspect it is coming from a place of you feeling overwhelmed. You go into a cycle of feeling pressured (like the GCSE you mentioned) know you aren't prepared and then it bursts from you in a big way. 

Have you thought on perhaps creating a way to organize your thoughts and what you would like to accomplish both on a large scale, and small scale. For example, small daily goals, yearly goals, etc. If you focus on everything at once, your mind will get overwhelmed very quickly! It's good to try and compartmentalize everything in a way that you don't think too much each day. 

Basically, like re-wiring your daily mental thoughts. I think you would really benefit from CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) with positive reinforcement. 

Sorry about my rambling, I hope that I have helped. Please feel free to PM me if there is anything else I could possibly help with. I hope things have gotten a little better for you. :)  ",1515644969,,dsi6v0t,False,t3_7phmpd,,,t3_7phmpd,/r/autism/comments/7phmpd/really_struggling_right_now/dsi6v0t/,1517775638,3,,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,,,1481295339.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,35465.0,,public,,,,,,,,

You might even want to specifically let the Disability Services know about that professor. They might be able to talk to the professor and tell them that what they are expecting of you is unreasonable.

Is there any way you could carry a small whiteboard and marker with you to class? I feel like that would be easiest to see. I'd also suggest just writing something on a piece of paper and giving it to the professor if you're answering a question or something like that.

I am verbal most of the time (unless I'm in shutdown mode). In graduate school I had a meeting about ""participation grades"" in my class (they gave everyone C's just to make us talk more and I felt like with my anxiety talking twice is a ton, and they still gave me a C).

During the meeting I basically shut down, but I wrote my questions in my notebook beforehand, and so I showed him the questions that I wrote down and he answered it.

You could try having a small notebook (like travel-sized) to carry around to show people.

I've had other pretty bad experiences with professors when I'm in shutdown mode, and one of them did what that professor did in your post - assumed I could talk and just kept asking me questions. They were obviously concerned but thought I could talk about it and went on for like 10 minutes until they left me alone. Honestly I feel like professors and teachers are one of the least-empathetic people when it comes to anxious and autistic people.

As for people who know sign language: there may be clubs that operate in sign language with students your school might be able to recruit for various purposes...though if what I saw in college is anything to go by, the interpreter will be hilariously under compensated (I think mine gave $5 gift cards or academic credit). Having people like that work for the professor in addition to TAs could be a good resume builder and could give the interpreter a good reference. Also, there may be smaller colleges close to you that have people who can interpret.

One last idea: ability to answer a question during office hours. Why? So text-to-speech is not in front of everyone.

I never ran into a professor that kicked someone out of a course for not being able to answer a question, and the situation of a student being unable to answer a question happened a lot in my college. If you see that, and it is possible, I would advise changing professors. In my opinion, what the professor should be doing is trying to either coax that answer out of you (the written answer for a colleague of yours to speak, for example) or moving on to see if another student knows to let the class flow. 

I wish we could sue for things like that D and the situation of being kicked out for a nonverbal situation being forced to a verbal situation. That may be a question for r/legaladvice depending on the length of time.

You need to head to your disability office on campus and ask for one. 

Some accommodations I can think of:

- being able to use aac devices or PECS to talk (although iirc this isn't your first option?)

-being able to write or type answers, like carrying around a whiteboard or a tablet with large font that you can just show people when you want to respond to something. 

- sign language interpreter, some schools will provide, others you will want to hire. For you this might be your best bet.

Ankyloglossia, also known as tongue-tie, is a congenital oral anomaly that may decrease mobility of the tongue tip and is caused by an unusually short, thick lingual frenulum, a membrane connecting the underside of the tongue to the floor of the mouth. Ankyloglossia varies in degree of severity from mild cases characterized by mucous membrane bands to complete ankyloglossia whereby the tongue is tethered to the floor of the mouth.

For it to be a 'special interest' in the autistic sense (under the restricted or repetitive symptoms) it needs to be unusual in it's subject or intensity (which can be difficult to gauge). Socialising isn't an unusual interest and there's no easy way to say it's 'too intense,' it's something like e.g. philanthropy, or making profits, or teaching etc. where there's really no limit to how intense a focus is acceptable.

Difficulty in social communication/interaction is the other major characteristic of autism though, and includes stuff like ""too many personal details"" in a conversation. 

There's a persistent myth that you can't be on the spectrum and interested in other people, which isn't part of the diagnosis and isn't true at all.

None of these terms is worse than the other. The purpose of using the right term is for accuracy of what you have. Also, you pointed out the definition of disease, but none of the other words; disease is specifically the impairment of one part. That is what makes disease the wrong term. Autism is literally Autism Spectrum Disorder, this is because Autism is the impairment of not one part, but many. Autism is a developmental disorder, that is thought to have a connection to polygenic traits. Personally I do not have Autism, but I work with those that do. However, I myself suffer with a genetic disorder, because it causes many parts to be impaired not just one. It is offensive and rude when people argue with me about my own medical diagnosis.

I haven't disclosed that I have autism to anyone in the company, and I don't intend to. At the same time, I do agree that people where I work (and in my industry in general) could do a better job of working with people who may not think or act exactly like them.

It is not about reminding people that autism exists, it is about increasing awareness of what autism really is, as FAR too many people know it exists but have such a stereotypical and shallow understanding of it.

Once the real complexities of autism as a condition are properly explained; how the spectrum actually works as an allegory, instead of the common ""how far along the spectrum"" idea most have; how different people on the spectrum can be from each other, and how for many it is an ""invisible condition"" to most others but it doesn't mean that person doesn't struggle with certain things, a greater awareness and understanding becomes the best platform for generating acceptance.

Ideally we should just be promoting acceptance but that is hampered if the people you address have little awareness and understanding.

So, I don't see this month as demeaning at all. It is just the first pragmatic step we need to take. The only part that would be demeaning is perhaps some content that may be badly made, like from the organisation which must not be named.

ABA is an intense behavioral changing therapy, and is honestly too intense for most ""high functioning"" kids. Depending on your beliefs, it can be useful for people who have limited life skills. See ""Fathering Autism"" on YouTube. They have a video explaining how they use ABA for their 13yo with ""infantile autism"". All people have different opinions but they feel it is beneficial for their daughter.

We did speech for a while and OT to help with loads of sensory issues. She is 4 now, on her 2nd year of preschool, and no longer goes to therapies. She is happy, healthy, and has learned skills to help her understand when she is having sensory trouble. She will be in a mainstream classroom for kindergarten (unless something changes by then). 

If speech is your biggest concern, give her time! Kids are smart, adaptive, and eager to learn. She will surprise you at every milestone! Speech therapy is amazing, thought it takes a long time for speech skills to form.

Our oldest is on the spectrum, we found our just after her 2nd birthday.

You have an opportunity to be an Ambassador of sorts.  Many many people have no knowing relationship with a person on the autistic spectrum so have no understanding of the nuances involved.  I was in a very similar situation and started with my supervisor.  I provided a letter from my doctor confirming my diagnosis and discussed with them ways I might better “fit in” with my awkwardness and quirks (including how some accommodations might help reduce the ones generated by anxiety).

There was a period of adjustment for sure.  This is often a new experience for people of NT persuasions.  Over time my co-workers learn not only about me and my own variety of what AS manifests but more about AS in general.  Not only did the situation normalize but I found they supported me.  When someone came in from another department and started up with, “what’s with the guy sitting in the dark over there” in an attempt to point out the “weird-o” my co-workers were quick to tell him I was light sensitive and educate him about tolerance.

I hope other people, such as yourself get the opportunity to help others learn about AS, it’s a worthwhile investment for us all.

As an adult, I avoided going to get haircuts like the plague. I had long, thick hair and eventually I shaved it mostly off, which made things a little easier.

Then I made friends with some stylists. Now they do my hair and are really understanding.

What I hate/what we do:

1. The hair washing. The greatest eternal punishment I can imagine would be just sitting in that horrible chair while someone vigorously wets and rubs my scalp.

Instead: sometimes they just wet my hair. If it needs washing, it’s quick and they listen to what touches I hate. Ie stay away from my temples for the love of all that is good.

2. Small talk. The worst. Also you can barely hear over the hairdryers so it’s half an hour of me going “haha yeah” and wanting to die.

Instead: we are pals, so they don’t care if I’m quiet. Or, we can have real conversations about mutual people we know or about the movie we watched together last weekend. They know it’s rough for me, and they get it.

3. The little hairs! So scratchy!

Instead: they take care to remove them frequently.

4. That horrible smock you wear. It’s hot and tight around your neck. Nope.

Instead: they remember (or I remind them) to loosen it a bit and we also laugh at how I am sweating a nervous bucket.

5. The overall sensory nightmare that is a hair salon. Lights, machines whirring, a lot of people, all the smells.

Instead: I found a salon that has three chairs. It’s quiet, they rely on natural light, and they use only the best products which IMO have a less chemically smell. 

Basically, you just have to shop around to find the place that fits, and knowing the stylist helps. If you don’t know a stylist, you can look at some local Facebook pages: some (such as my salon) make an effort to be inclusive, and will express publicly their efforts to provide haircuts to those who are autistic or have other issues.",1519301389,,dunbs6b,False,t3_7z7na0,,,t3_7z7na0,/r/autism/comments/7z7na0/autism_and_getting_haircuts/dunbs6b/,1520115542,2,,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,,,1519300772.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,64760.0,,public,,,,,,,,

You're a smart person. You should be able to detect the error in what you're suggesting here. Do you truly believe your son would never be able to fall asleep without it? He's human. Unless he's using toothpicks to keep his eyelids open, he's gonna grow tired of waiting on a specific blanket. 

You, as the parent, have a responsibility to at least try and recognize when to substitute your son's judgment for your own. He might not think he can sleep without a specific blanket, but that's just not true. Help him realize it's not true by not indulging false needs. Be kind. Be loving. Give him space to work it out of his system with whatever tantrum he attempts. He's gonna be fine, and he'll discover that. And things will get easier for the both of you. 

The longer you wait to correct your approach in this regard, the worse he will get, and the more stress you will suffer as a result, in the long run.

Well it was getting long again.  I kept hassling him because, well someone needs to.  (My job is to push him and he was okay to be pushed.  I never pushed him past what would be totally uncomfortable.)  He kept telling me no.  I then asked him if I were to get my hair cut, then he got his hair cut, and then we went to McDonalds if he would do it.  He seemed to like that idea.  
  
On Friday, he rocked it.  I went in beforehand and told them I was coming in with a student and told them some of his behaviors (really none) and that I'd like the TV turned down.  I was late the day of because of traffic.  When I got there he was there.  He was talking to the barbers about french fries.  They had a music channel on.  Mom said that she didn't tell him where he was going (we had discussed not doing that) and when he saw the barber shop his eyes started watering but mom said the teacher was there and he was willing.  
  
We had to wait 10 minutes.  The shop was packed.  All three chairs were filled.  I talked him to him to distract him.  I got my hair cut first and told him everything that was going on and how it felt.  The barber showed him what she was doing to my hair and let him touch the different clippers.  At one point a loud regular came in and the barbers hushed him and told him they were having quiet time.  
  
When it came to his turn, I talked him through it.  He has learned some calming strategies at school with his ABA aide.  So I coached him through all of them.  I even asked him if he needed a break at one point and he said no.  He sat still the entire time.  He followed directions on how to hold his head.  Grandma was there because she was visiting and she said it was the longest time she had seen him sit still and mom wasn't expecting him to finish the haircut.  But he rocked it.  His first time in a barber shop.  His first time letting someone other than family cut his hair.  I told mom it would have to be a monthly thing now.  Then mom took him to get french fries and I joined him.

,dag1979,,,[],,,,text,t2_3pr91,False,,"My son had horrible sleep issues for years. It was so bad that we were all super under-rested and it nearly drove my wife and I to split apart.

That all changed when my wife attended a sleep seminar with a specialist who's name escapes me.

There were a lot of tips and tricks, but the thesis of it all is ""give your child the tools they need to fall asleep on their own. If they need you to fall asleep, it will never end"".

So the problem is, when your child wakes up at night, instead of just rolling over and going back to sleep, they think ""I need mommy or daddy to get me back to sleep!"". Hence, the waking up.

&amp;#x200B;

What worked for us was, when we put him to sleep, we simply bring him to bed, make sure he's comfortable. Give him a kiss, say good night and walk out of the room. When we first started doing this, it was hard. He got up immediately and ran to the door. At which point we repeated the exact same thing, DOZENS OF TIMES at first. After a week, we only had to repeat it three or four times. Within a month, he'd go to sleep on the first try. Now when we wakes up in the middle of the night, he knows how to simply go back to sleep because we're never in the room with him when he falls asleep every evening. Falling back asleep alone is all he had to learn.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm not saying it's easy or that it works for all kids, but it absolutely worked for us and it saved our family.

I'm not going to lie, they likely aren't going to go away anytime soon, but they do become more manageable once you find the things that work. Also 4 years old is a very high energy phase of life in general, so a lot of these sleep issues stem from being a kid as well.   


\- burn more energy through the day. My son has movement and gym at school and now gymnastics twice a week. He goes to the trampoline park often. He loves to go for runs and walks. His sleep schedule gets worse the more complacent he is. He needs a strong outlet for energy during the day to sleep better at night.   


\- consider upping that melatonin. My doctor advised that I could safely give him up to 10mg but my son is older so definitely try asking your doctor first. I give my son 3mg at the same time every night to trigger the bedtime routine. He gets another 3mg every two hours, rarely does he need the full 10mg. Melatonin is the only thing I've ever used for his sleep, he doesn't take any other medications.   
   
\- if your son needs less sleep, consider adjusting his bedtime. Other parents are horrified to hear that I don't put him to bed until 10pm, but I do if I want him to sleep all night. He currently sleeps from 10pm - 7pm when he does sleep through the night.   


\- create a safe space where your child can play safely and you can rest. With my son, if he wakes up, he stays awake. There is no going back to bed for him. So if I must be awake with him, I try to rest as much as possible. For us, this means camping in the living room, where I can lay down and relax and he can play beside me.

 They make cloth chew bands. I have one. They’re nice. You can find them on amazon. Also a site called stimtastic 

If it’s just that she’s needing stimulation and it doesn’t have to necessarily be chewing, see if there are other stim toys that she would like?

I know this is basically useless information because it’s what you’ve been doing anyway, I’m sorry. 

There may be one other thing. When I get the need to chew sometimes, it’s not because of stimulation. It’s because my gums or jaws are hurting and I don’t know why, and chewing/moving my mouth makes it stop and distracts me. The urge to make it stop may be stronger than the urge to not get her clothes wet. 

If there are musical toys she likes to hum along with or sing or make noise, or a song she likes..maybe play that, see if she’ll try that? 

Of course, this is all just guesswork on my part, because that’s applicable to my situation, but might not be to hers. So please don’t take what I’ve said with absolute authority. You know your daughter better than anyone else.   

For cloth related stim toys on amazon , just try “cloth chew band” and I think a store called the therapy shoppe has some?

Also stimtastic for more rubber based chews and stims is good. Hope this helps. ",1548342084,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eeui8p0,,t3_ajd2xx,,True,t3_ajd2xx,/r/autism/comments/ajd2xx/chewing_clothes/eeui8p0/,1548342085,15,True,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The usual approach to this (in adults with sleep problems) is to be strict about wake up times (every day), no napping and let the rest take care of itself.  This can take a few weeks of very disciplined work to make small changes.  This is harder to stick to than it seems.

It may well be that he needs a lot less sleep than 12 hours at night (particularly if he's napping to catch up in the day) and you might have a better pattern with a later bed time.

They are a soft feel and don't make noises when they touch. They are nice to chew. They are soft enough so they don't hurt your teeth but still have enough resistance to probably last a long time. You can bite down quite hard and get a pretty good squish, just be careful you don't miss the beads and chomp down on the metal ring.


I like them because have a stim that can be a little destructive. I press and pick at the top corner of my finger nails.

I have a 4 yr old on the spectrum too. He is also having issues with potty training and, like your son, he also has a tendency to develop in bursts. I know he will wake up one day and reject pull ups and just start using the bathroom. 

With all his difficulties we try to turn it into a game. Potty training has been the same. He currently asks to use the potty when he needs to poo because he gets to play a game on daddy's phone that he loves. We realise he's just addicted to the game but it's working and so that is what we do. He has had major issues with constipation from refusing to poop so we see this as a great move forward helping him realise that poos are great and that he shouldn't hold it in.

We're not in a rush to get him out of his pull ups, he's a smart boy and he'll figure it out at his own pace. Our objective is to eliminate all the stomache aches he was having from holding it in. I do realise this is a lot of talk about poop but that is how it is around here at the moment!

He will stay amped up for a long time and it is very challenging to get him to work himself back down.  At home, he will go sit in his room until he is ready to come back downstairs.  At school, they kindof have the same option, but it doesn't always work.

His teacher has a screen setup so if the other kids are too distracting for him, he can work behind the screen.  They have headphone is class, too.  I understand your point in finding the cause of the anger, but I feel like we have done that, it is just getting him to appropriately deal with those feelings.  If they are too overwhelming for him, I need another option to help him.  I feel that what we have done so far just isn't enough for him, but not sure what else I can do beside just keep doing what we have always done and just hope that something changes one day.

If we end up going with the medication, I will of course involve my son.  I am okay with us having to try different ones to make sure we find the one that works best for him.  If none work, well I guess it is what it is.  I am also hoping with age and maturity, a lot of this anger and frustration will go away.

Your title and the mention of ABA makes it sound like it's a problem with behavior, but those behaviors have underling causes. It's possible that he gets angry in a way that is hard to control because of sensory overwhelm, because being forced to change tasks or break out of routine is intense and highly distressing, or other reasons. Getting clear on the causes may help find ways to both avoid the anger and help manage it: if it's sensory related, avoiding overwhelming stimuli will help prevent it, and figuring out what sensory stimuli (or lack thereof) are soothing will help find ways to help him calm down if he gets angry, and so on. 

That said, if ADHD is a factor, then medication is worth considering. Many people with ADHD find medication to be helpful, though there are also those who do not (so it's not a universal panacea). As long as you are involving your son in the process, getting feedback from him and not making unilateral decisions about medication I think medication can be approached ethically. ADHD can involve problems with both focus and emotion regulation, and sometimes medication can help with that. That said, it may take time to find a medication that works or that doesn't have tolerable side effects. A medication that is a great fit for one person might be awful for another.

Then I got a bad one. The ones who are like “I’m the adult and I said so.” They treat me like I’m a baby sometimes, and it gets annoying when I’m just trying to ask a question.

Believe it or not I genuinely think ABA has good intentions and they could help some younger kids. With that said, it only goes to an extent. If you do put him in ABA, I recommend only keeping him in there until he starts developing more self awareness and starts thinking for himself more. ABA is good until you want to build your boundaries and your own thoughts. 

With that also being said, let the kid talk about aba. If he hates it, try to get him to tell you why. If it’s “I want to do &lt;thing&gt; the entire session but they won’t let me”, don’t bother. That’s a thing aba can help with! Making him more comfortable with change and flexibility would be great in the future.

If it’s something you should be genuinely concerned about, don’t put 10000% of your trust into aba. Take your own path. Request a new BT if this one doesn’t work for him. Take him out completely if it escalates.

No matter what the future hold you and your daughter will make it through, I'm sure. I don't know you and I suppose I could be wrong, but from my experience and hunch, id say your daughter is extremely fortunate to be able to grow up in such a loving home and environment.

I work on a high performance team that works with high risk adults in the community (basically trying to proactively treat individuals on their way (so to speak) to long term hospital admissions and legal issues) and I'll be honest, even our head psychiatrist would hold the same thought of wanting to know the future. ASD is challenging for sure, but also so rewarding. It takes a lot of time, patience, and I'm sure more than a few tired nights, but even those moments you're not sure, I'd bet your daughter will appreciate every piece of what you do for them. 

Keep on doing what your doing, don't be afraid to ask hard questions and advocate and I am sure your daughter will live a happy and healthy life.

,Beardchilles,,,[],,,,text,t2_uk2ks,False,,"I don't have experience with ASD in Montessori schools but I'd say if you like it and it works, it may be effective. Also without knowing your situation/daughter it's hard to make recommendations.

With that said, I think fantasy play is huge. I work in a neurodevelopmental service at a mental health hospital where almost all of our clients have ASD (as well as other things as it is based around dual diagnosis eg. ASD and schizophrenia co-currently). 

I agree that your daughter will benefit from ""real world"" experience and education but I also think that fantasy play allows people to build themselves into who they are. It allows for free roam of interest and discovery. I also think that fantasy play can pose real world understanding through an enjoyable medium. For instance, I use a role-playing game called dungeons and dragons where I can create an imaginative world where the person can be engaged in social engagement (with the fantasy characters) without the real world consequences of their mistakes. 

An example: I set up a world for someone aged 15 years old and who loves medieval lore, dragons, etc. They have trouble reading people and having back and forth conversations. In game I'm able to engage the client in conversation pertaining to their interest. When they make a mistake (reading the situation poorly/saying the wrong thing) there are still consequences but they are in game and not lasting/real. This allows for more comfort in learning and tbh, easy success in the initial phases. Once they've demonstrated some improved skills I may bring them to a game shop or bring them to a small group to play (for the social interaction and real world attempts to connect). Once they're okay there, I may bring them to a more generalized social place like a mall or park where fantasy may not be present, but the person can transfer their now learned skills to the real world.

Overall my BIGGEST advice would be to attend to their interests at this early age and find ways of incorporating those interests in the learning at home. Take the real world skills they learned at school, see if they actually understand vs just following suit, and if they don't fully grasp it, find methods of teaching through their interests. Nobody learns if they don't care about the lesson. Also incentive things/learning. Make clear goals and rewards and ensure the rewards are truly desired by your daughter.

1. It is important to frame discussion of difficulties as what additional tools/supports he needs to achieve the objective in question.  Try to never limit his possible outcomes in your thinking or your speech.  Kids of all varieties will internalize these expectations and act as if they are true.  If you say he can't do it, then he won't believe he can.  It may be true that he cannot, but that is something that your child needs to discover for himself.
2. The better that your son can operate in the general public the more happy and successful he will be.  Every effort should be made to help maximize this outcome where possible.  It would be wonderful if children were kind and understanding and welcoming, and it would also be wonderful if adults were considerate and made reasonable accommodations as a matter of course.  Neither of these things are true.  There are people looking for victims to abuse, and there are people who just don't care about whatever special needs your child might have.  The best way you can support your child is to help him develop the social skills and habits he needs to avoid receiving an undue amount of attention from these people.  This is true for NT kids as well, of course.
3. I think talking about autism just happens naturally.  Your kid goes to IEP meetings, probably has therapy, and likely notices that he acts differently than many other kids.  He is already aware of it, even if you haven't talked about it with him,.  One way that we have spoken about the topic is relating it to other disabilities, like missing an arm, being deaf, etc.  These things make tasks harder, but not impossible, and the way to do something that works for most people may not be the best way for him.  This circumstance has nothing to do with him as a person, just like being born with an allergy to peanuts wouldn't.  I wouldn't hide it from him, but I would let him be the leader in what level of detail is appropriate.

TELL HIM NOW. Explain in whatever doses he can handle, but do not leave him in the dark. What you know, he should know, in words he can understand. This is his body, he has to live in it for the rest of his life and he needs to know how it works. 

My husband's mother didn't bother to tell him much at all about any of his diagnoses and as an adult is finally coming to realize that MANY parts of his personality are things many people with ASD/ADHD experience. He thought he was alone. 

He has spent much of his life just believing he is weird. He, to this day, is finding out that many of his quirks or difficulties are due to his diagnoses and are actually quite common. I don't know how many times I have had to tell him ""Yeah, that's an autism thing, don't sweat it"" when he's becoming frustrated that his brain isn't working the way he perceives it should. Ignorance has hurt him so much and has held him back from a lot. 

I firmly believe you SHOULD treat him as 'normal' and you should encourage development of 'normal' social skills. He needs to learn to do things like have two-sided conversations, make eye contact, and tolerate sensory issues to an extent without melting down. He needs to gain some control over his reactions to sensory issues as he grows up if at all possible. People who don't encourage 'normal' development end up with kids with wasted potential because they don't have those training wheels to get into society and have the opportunity to live an average life. Respect what he can't do right now, but encourage him to find a way to do it as he grows and learns more about himself. 

Don't coddle him. It won't help him at all. The world is mean and he needs to stand on his own feet whenever he can, he needs to learn to Macgyver a way for him to handle day-to-day challenges. He doesn't have to do it the 'standard' way but he does have to find a way to make things work for himself. I have to reiterate here, it isn't for the benefit of society that he finds a way to mesh with what is 'normal', it is for him and these skills will make him significantly more prepared for the life challenges he will be playing on 'hard mode'. 

As for telling others about your son's autism, I think you're doing it right. If there is a situation, explain. But (personally) I cannot stand autism moms who basically plaster their kid's diagnosis all over them in a way that makes it an inescapable neon sign that doesn't allow them to be anything but ""that kid with autism"". He needs room to grow and be [his name], not a label. There are still too many misconceptions and he will suffer if his diagnosis precedes him. When you think he is informed and understanding enough, ask him how much he would like to share and check periodically as he gets older if his feelings have changed at all. Remember, at the end of the day, that he is 7. Expressing feelings is hard for a good portion of 7 year olds. 

Make sure your home is a positive place where he is free to talk about all of it. Knowledge is power and open discussion at home will make it not feel shameful or like erasure. Tell him his only hard limits are ones he decides himself, and sometimes he will have to do something differently than others but he can still do it. Find power in language, ""working on"" is much more positive than ""can't"". There is always another way to get a task done, and sometimes it takes significant 'working on' to find a way and make it happen, but just keep trying.

In some situations you made need to ""warn"" people in advance, ie, my son hated having his hair washed, so I always told barbers/stylists in advance that he would not be doing that, that he was VERY particular about certain aspects of a haircut, and then I would tip them very well.
2. Schools are mandated under IDEA to provide a Least Restrictive Environment (LRE). So they will strive to mainstream as much as possible. However, if this is not your wish because it is not ideal for your son, then you need to let the team know that some of your son's limitations may not work by mainstreaming and you're ok with a more restrictive environment (like a Special Day Class (SDC). Also a letter from your child's treating physician explaining some of the major issues can be helpful.
3. My son was diagnosed in 5th grade and we told him. By then, he knew he was different, and people were treating him differently. He was getting in trouble a lot as well as spending time in the hallway or office when he was overwhelmed. This all contributed to some pretty bad depression. I feel that letting him know when we got the diagnosis helped him to accept that, in a way, he wasn't crazy for feeling different... he WAS different. It helped us all understand what we needed to learn, coping mechanism, sensory issues, etc so he could begin to advocate in small ways. There are also books geared toward children to explain autism. There are books that list 10/50/100 ""things about autism"" which you and your family can go through together and talk about which ones apply, which ones don't, etc.

,protodro,,,[],,,,text,t2_inlbi,False,,"I think there's a huge difference between telling a child that they're autistic and doing something to make them feel that their autism makes them abnormal or that there are lots of things they can't do.

As an analogy, imagine you have a left-handed child. It's OK to tell them that they're left-handed, to talk to them about their left-handedness, and if necessary even to acknowledge that there are certain things that are harder for left-handed people and that they might need accommodations, e.g. telling them that their writing is smudging because they write with their left hand, and that you'll give them a smudge-free pen to help with it.

What would cause problems would be if you told a left-handed child things like, ""You're left-handed so you're different compared to normal kids. You'll never be able to write with your right hand like them. You will have all kinds of problems throughout your life because you're left-handed.""

It would be erasure to treat a left-handed kid like they're a right-handed kid. It's not erasure to treat a left-handed kid like they're just a normal kid who happens to write with their left hand.

Same goes with an autistic kid. It would be erasure to treat an autistic kid like they're neurotypical. But it's not erasure to tell an autistic kid that they're a normal kid whose brain just works a bit differently from other kids.

To answer your questions:

1. Yes, that's totally fine. It seems like you have a good idea of when it's appropriate to talk about, and you're doing the right thing by not making a big deal out of it.

2. Unless they're insisting that you should treat him like a neurotypical kid, I think it's fine. Autism should be normalised. Autistic people shouldn't be made to feel like they're fundamentally wrong or alien because of autism.

3. I'm not sure, but from what you've said it seems like you're taking an overall good and fair approach, and so I would trust your judgement. I didn't get diagnosed until adulthood, and I wish I had known when I was much younger.

No, it’s not, but a “normal” kid wouldn’t have an IEP in the first place, so don’t take them too literally. I suspect the point they’re trying to get across is not to take an ablist approach, like “oh he can’t do that because autism”. I.e. learn his boundaries and capabilities, don’t assume them.

( and to be fair to the school people -- he might be one of those ""I can't"" kids, and they were actually wondering how much of that comes from home versus from inside his head.  Like Marlin in Finding Nemo, we can overexplain things to adults to try to help our kids with their struggles, but instead we magnify the problem into a huge deal that it's not.  You probably know exactly the scene I'm thinking of. -- ""We call it his 'lucky fin.'"")   


I think it's very important to be open and honest with him about what's the deal.  (tho I don't have advice on timing)  When Sesame Street introduced Julia, my son was 3rd grade, I think.  We watched a news report on her addition to the cast, and it opened a door to conversation -- one that included ""your brain works differently in some areas, so you have to work extra hard on some things, while other things come super-easy.""   


Telling a kid about his diagnosis shouldn't be about giving him a ""get out of work free"" card, but explain WHY things are harder.  Things were harder for me, too, only I didn't know why.  Once I knew the why, figuring out the how became a little easier.

I'll share my story sometime soon, it's long so I need some time to type it out on an actual keyboard. Feel free to PM or remind me if I don't reply within a day or two!

Not so short summary would be: lots of therapy and therapists on and off since I was about 4 but never an official diagnosis besides depression and quite a few ""maybe but not quite (ASD, trauma, chronic fatigue , just socially awkward) things.""

I got more support during my first pregnancy and that psychiatrist thought there must be a good reason for why I struggle so much more than most people while appearing quite/very capable in other ways. E.g. I can't work fulltime. Studying full time for 4 years meant life was only studying and I couldn't do anything else whatsoever during that time (low energy, needing lots of time to recharge etc.). So thanks to that psychiatrist I got a referral for an in depth assessment (not just for ASD but the suspicions were there - definitely after my mom got diagnosed last year).

So apparently I'm still not quite there yet officially. But suspicions have been around from professionals since I was 17 or so but never made official. Part of that may be that there was some SA when I was 4 (why my parents got me into therapy so young) so I guess the question often is ""early trauma?"" vs autism, but obviously there's no reason why one couldn't have both.

Some parts of my life suck, but this makes it sound very dramatic. There's been some drama for sure but it's seriously not all bad. Just felt I had to add that to this history.

* Has his social situation changed? New teachers/classmates/aides?
* Has his school schedule changed? New recess, lunch, or class times?
* Has he had any noticeable falling out with friends/peers?

These are always worth a peek.

A few other thoughts:

* Has he noticed any major divergence between himself and peers? Noticeably higher functioning than other ASD/Special Needs students but noticeably lower functioning than NTs? There could be some self-concept issues.
* Has he recently been forced to ""grow up"" on an exterior time table-- e.g: asked to be more regulatory, withholding of pleasure, or assigned more work without major communication about the ""whys"" and ""hows?""
* Is he engaged by his schoolwork? Does it seem like there's purpose to it?

I don't disagree with other comments that the cold and sensory issues could be setting him off, but you have to remember that for the most part ASD individuals are still fundamentally people-- they just have issue communicating and the developmental divergence that comes from communication issues. If it's anything like my functioning issues--which admittedly didn't truly get bad until I was in the middle of high school--then he likely just feels like he's completely out of control of his life and isn't getting the answers/engagement from his support structures that he needs.

It sucks because there isn't a ""good"" answer to such problems, but one thing that makes it infinitely more tolerable is pointing out that:

1. Almost everyone in society is stuck modifying their behavior for school and pointless work.
2. It isn't fair that we have to do so, nor necessarily logical, nor efficient.
3. It seems like things aren't going to ever get better even if we acquiesce-- look at messages from adults trickling down to him; when I was a child the overriding message adults communicated to me, explicitly or implicity, is that adulthood sucks and there's nothing really to look forward to. (Aside: Do *not* try to remedy this by promising that things in the future like driving, or a girlfriend, or living on your own are things that make the bad stuff ""worth"" it. That's not how life works, you know it, and the kid will likely smell how full of shit you are. Life is good and bad and neither cancel each other out, the important thing is knowing how to add more to the good and mitigate the bad.)
4. Everyone is fallible, including him and including yourself.
5. Logic, fairness, etc. doesn't really enter into the equation for how life works.
5. (This is the important one) You are there to help him make the best out of his situation, and the important step is to identify problems, identify possible solutions, and work out good/productive things for his growth that he can do in/outside of school to make the problems he can't fix bearable.

I was diagnosed a year and a half ago (aged 40) in England. I was told the availability of any help depended on where you live (county council type thing). The people that diagnosed me catered lists of helpful services, but due to where I live there was no help available. 

We tried talking to citizens advice, we went through all of the charities and services available, but no one could help me. I'm virtually house bound these days, so the social groups that were the only thing available weren't any use to me. 

It's worth trying all of those things if you feel you need support, it's far from guaranteed there will be any help. but for the sake of a few emails it's worth a shot. 

For the most part the best things for me have been time to let everything sink in, being kind and understanding with myself and having someone to vocalise thoughts to about the ever changing landscape of my thoughts. There's a lot to process after the diagnosis and a lot of it can be really cathartic.

The other thing is I'm finally going to try private therapy soon. There's no therapists on the NHS that specialise in autism or PTSD that I can get access to, but thanks to a kind person I can now try private. I don't know how it will go, but I'm hopeful.

After the diagnosis I was so relieved, but I quickly started to feel abandoned, I'm still not over that. But the diagnosis itself has helped and it's allowing me to try to find another way in life.

As a kid I used to blow up but now as an adult I just shutdown most of the time.

It could be a shutdown, anxiety or combination (or anxiety leading to a shutdown).

Honestly there's not much you can do. Attempting to comfort/touch/snap him out of it is only going to cause a further retreat (at least in my experience). For me usually I shutdown before I meltdown but sometimes I will only experience one or the other. The key thing is to just take the pressure off and minimize input (plus of course try to avoid this happening in the first place).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a university student and usually reasonably eloquent but when that type of thing hits I just...talking is too much. Responding is too much most of the time and I can hear what you're saying but it just comes in as noise that adds to the overwhelm or the words just won't come out of my mouth. Sometimes you'll get one-word replies (if your request is simple like 'Do you want your sensory wrap/ear defenders?') or I'll grunt/chirp or whatever (I like animal noises) but that's about it until I've 'come back' and am able to speak/respond again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone is different but usually in a situation like this I just want to be left alone somewhere quiet, dark, small and calm to be able to regroup, usually with the help of some sensory tools (glow in the dark putty, weighted things, ear defenders, my sensory wrap). Don't touch/talk to or disturb me in any way. Don't ask me tons of questions. I just need time to, as my OT puts it, 'flush my brain'.

Also, maybe, for whatever reason, outside is too chaotic and loud this yr? My son had that problem with his class last yr (not this yr as the teacher and the kids in class r less noisy and chaotic). That will cause stress and meltdowns.

The single most important thing you can do early on is to establish communication and reinforce that their input is valued regardless of the form it takes.

My GP made a referral and sent a copy of my doc along with it. Two months later I started my diagnosis interviews, 3 2.t hour sessions to go over my family, my history, my traits/symptoms and habits etc

I got it for two reasons.

1. Better understanding and acceptance of myself. 

2. To access care available going forward. 

I didnt have the diagnosis on my previous post grad, and the stress sent me into a 6month burn out. So I sought my diagnosis knowing it would allow me to access necessary help. I am currently accessing that help while taking my Masters degree in order to make sure I survive it.

[],TheFeshy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4d7rn,False,,"Having read the article u/arphazar linked, I *disagree* with the suggestion put forth by the paper's author that autism is over-diagnosed.

I don't disagree with everything he says, but with that basic question, I do.  Here are some highlights:

* His thesis point is that the difference between ""normal"" and ""diagnosed autistic"" has shrunk since the 70's.  I agree with him here.  Except I think that's exactly what we should *expect*, given the much greater understanding of autism as a spectrum, and increased awareness of it.  Whereas he feels it is a worrying indicator of overdiagnosis, a conclusion I don't feel is supported.
* His suggestion that the difference between autistic and non-autistic will shrink to ""zero"" within ""five or ten years"" is pure slippery-slope fallacy.
* He's worried that the benefits provided to autistic kids (extra support in school, etc.) are incentivizing people to get diagnosed.  Which I agree with, but not to the extent he does (he believes it incentivizes parents of children who are not autistic to get diagnosed; I believe it incentivizes parents of children who *are* autistic to jump through the numerous hoops to get the diagnosis and support.)
* He's also worried that the increased number of autism diagnosis will diminish the amount of support available to the most severe cases who need it most.  I think examining that prospect would be more complicated (more people brings more awareness and more money, so it's not as straightforward as he makes it sound.)  I also think that making support dependent on disability level rather than a binary diagnosis fixes this pretty easily.  And, at least in my state, this is already the case.  Maybe it's different in Canada where the researchers are?
* He decries the ""checklist diagnosis"" - if you show these symptoms, you get the diagnosis.  I certainly hope it's not that simple in Canada.  I know it isn't here.  Checklists are used to determine if a more thorough testing and analysis would be appropriate.  In particular, he is bothered by some relatively minor criteria, like being bothered by tags and haircuts.  I am not familiar enough with the Canadian system to know if these checklists are used in the way his worries suggest - but I know they aren't used that way here in the US, and we have seen the same rise in Autism as our northern friends have.  So it is unlikely, therefore, that checklist diagnosis (if it really exists in Canada) is significant enough to contribute to a ""rampant"" increase in overdiagnosis.
* He's worried that the overdiagnosis is really *mis-*diagnosis, and therefore harms the patient by providing the wrong treatment.  Having been through this, potentially twice, from the other end, I understand his fears here.
* He thinks it's important to note that having some autistic traits is not the same as being autistic, and I agree with him about that.

It might help if I include some anecdotes from my own life here, to put my views on this study in focus:  My youngest daughter is, unquestionably, autistic.  Even by the definitions used in the 70's, she would still qualify.  Getting a diagnosis in my state, however, didn't mean much - at every step, for every service, she had to be tested and evaluated to see if she qualified for that service, based on her level of disability rather than her diagnosis (she was nonverbal, so speech therapy was approved.  She did not play or build, so occupational therapy was approved.  And so on.)  So even meeting the burden of diagnosis the paper's author suggests, she was still needs-tested here.

My middle daughter is diagnosed ADHD.  Over the years, we've come to believe she, too, is actually on the spectrum, as her primary symptoms (that prompted us to get her diagnosed) were executive functioning problems that are shared between both conditions.  Her symptoms, though, are much more mild than my youngest daughter.  While her speech and play skills were odd, they were not significantly delayed.  She was able to enter school normally, but with a few accommodations  But, as with my youngest daughter, the state's solution to either condition is all needs-based.  And what she needs doesn't change with the diagnosis - it's accommodations to help her deal with the executive functioning and distractions, and that would be the the same if the root cause is ADHD or Autism.

When I learned more about autism when my youngest was diagnosed, I discovered I was likely on the spectrum too.  But I wasn't by the definitions of autism that were used at the time; the ones the author suggests are more appropriate.  And, as the author suggests, I made it through school without any extra support, and was ""similar enough to normal"" that I didn't consider autism until well into adulthood.  So was he right, at least in my case?  Maybe not - maybe I wouldn't have had such a battle with depression in my youth if I had had similar accommodations and awareness.  It's hard to say.

So in my family, at least, *under*diagnosis is more likely - and furthermore, the issues that the author worries about regarding overdiagnosis and support are non-existent due to the needs-testing done by my state.  But at the same time, I understand his concerns - it is difficult to understand and provide for a condition whose symptoms can range from nonverbal and unable to provide self-care for life, to many people on the other end not even knowing they have a problem into adulthood.  However, that appears to be exactly what we are dealing with, and there *are* solutions.",1566484733,{},exp1ief,False,t3_ctvh0c,False,True,t3_ctvh0c,/r/autism/comments/ctvh0c/canadian_researcher_says_new_study_suggest_autism/exp1ief/,1566484750,1,True,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For starters though...  don't pick him up from his excursions unless he has procured your consent to do so beforehand. It only qualifies as punishment if you're dishing it out. And lock him out of your room.  It doesn't matter if he can't sleep.  Let him exhaust himself to unconsciousness if necessary.      
If he is going to take it upon himself to criticise your rationality, don't give him any leeway in his own irrational behaviours. 

If the whole thing about insisting on discussing uncomfortable topics doesn't abate...  just dredge up whatever HE is ashamed of in public.  Humiliate him (truthfully) and see how he likes it.

That makes sense, to control the things you're able to.

I'm slightly worried I'll never be able to live on my own.

I used to be ashamed and embarrassed about emotions and something that really helped me with regulating emotions is learning to sit with them, identify them, and accept them.

So maybe first. Try to set your priorities for yourself. It will be so hard. But you must focus on building you up, building your routines up, a little better each day. My aspie friend told me when I was not functioning: ""just get 1% better each day"". I eat a little more, a little better. I make sure my day has similar elements... I open my blinds, make my bed. Small things. I vaccuum... 

In my experience, when the routines are there, and you feel good, that releases energy, and you can take on more load: you can find a job that makes you feel purpose. But one thing at a time.

Try free your mind. You will think of him all the time, but get yourself to do stuff anyways. Don't text him. Don't call him. Don't let him talk about his stuff. Maybe not be in touch until he comes to you.

Please, think about yourself. Do things for yourself. For me listening to ambient helps tremendously in keeping my mind a little more controllable. I was recommended Liquid Mind today.

I am in a similar situation but I just realized today, after two days of not being in touch with my ""subject"", that I am starting to do better.

I think it could only help, sending the picture cards with him. Even if he doesn't use them, giving him the confidence that he *could* communicate if he needed to could help too.

TBH I feel like I understand his position very well xD. If he's not very comfortable at his birth mother's place, or goes there infrequently enough that it feels like a stressful change in life/schedule, he could very well just have less energy to deal with spoken communication &amp; acknowledging people the way allistic people expect. Also her being frustrated/not understanding is a good way of ruining things, in my experience. I wouldn't be surprised if he's picked up on it at some level and is being extra defensive (I know I do that). 

Something else to consider, if you haven't already, is that his birth mother might not realize that talking to him (and likely requiring him to listen/acknowledge what she's saying) probably use up his energy too. I know it does to me. People often think constant talking is friendly/nice/reassuring/polite, but it can definitely start feeling like they're actually trying to hurt me. If she tried a different way of socializing, it might get better.

I see myself (and other autistic people) socializing the way a typical pet cat does. Sometimes I like people, and sometimes I need to be alone, but most of the time I like doing my own thing around other people doing their own thing. As long as they mostly let me regulate the socializing, I can enjoy being around them alot. The best type of social situation IMO is where a few people that I'm comfortable with are enjoying themselves somewhere near me, and I can observe or jump in/out at any time without them being frustrated with me.

I've grown up not knowing I was autistic. I excelled at university and at work.

I've been working as a project manager for the last two years, but suffered a major burnout in January after two years of chronic stress. 

I couldn't work anymore, nor meet friends and I suffered from a host of physical and mental ailments. Including depression, ceaseless anxiety and panic attacks, extreme sensitivity to noise and other inputs. I was left stuck in my house for four months, before I could slowly start reintegration with work for a couple of hours a week. 

Since then I've also been diagnosed with autism.

I'm ten months further now. The anxiety and depression are partially gone. But I'm still extremely sensitive to noise, movements, smells, etc. I'm also having much, much more difficulty with masking, making eye contact, etc. In fact, although I have started working again I can barely cope. Taking the train, sitting in a crowded office room, meeting friends, going to a restaurant... Its all too much. 

It is af my body is forcing me to watch my energy reserves, not to mask anymore and to avoid situations with lots of input, or situations that give me stress. I definitely feel 'more' autistic than I've ever been. 

I'm not sure if regression is a thing for adults or not and I'm not interested in arguing over definitions. I know too little about it myself.

When I went in for my meeting, I clearly had no idea what I was doing, and they were just like ""ok based on your diagnoses and stated current struggles, you can have a note taker, an audio recorder for all classes, extended time on exams, and a quiet room for exams."" I also got a couple of classroom changes, bc being right next to a cafeteria or without windows was hard for me. 

I ended up going back and asking if it would be possible to underload (take fewer courses) and still be considered full-time for scholarship purposes (had a tuition scholarship that required FT). They don't exactly have control of that kind of thing, but they can make a recommendation to whoever does (in my case a donor and the fin aid office).

I'm sure there are other accomodations, but I don't know what they'd be. But I think disability offices tend be to on your side/want to get you what you need. So if you are honest and describe your experiences, or have a ""this is a problem, but I don't know what a good resolution would be"", they should be able to help.

Simple enough, right?

You get used to it, it feels very uncomfortable at first to walk in a room full of people in the morning (25), and say loudly “good morning!”, it’s all good when most of them react...

But often it’s not happening. 

They’re either reading, or talking, or some just don’t care. 

People are confusing, and it’s natural to spin a story around why some don’t say anything back, but I’m starting to realize that people just are the way they are, sometimes without having a good reason to refrain from greeting you back. 

I often thought I did something wrong or there was back talk, but then a few days later they greet you by shaking your hand, and all worried thoughts appeared to be for nothing. 

Just keep practicing, some will say nothing back, some will, some don’t care, others will appreciate it.

[],L-F-,,,[],,,,text,t2_6iorkrk,False,,"Thank you for pointing out something that should be obvious to anyone that has spent more than a handful of minutes on the internet. /s

The question is more where, as a society, we draw the line between something that ""just"" causes some difficulty and something that can be talked about as a disability. As somebody interested in linguistics I thought you were aware of the fact that the literal definition and the way words work in different social contexts general is often quite different.

&amp;#x200B;

You also seem to not make a huge difference between wheather society *does* influence wheather or not something is a disability and wheather it *should* be changed to accommodate a minority. The obvious answer is that meeting all minorities halfway, especially those where removing all barriers would often be a technical impossibility, is not plausible, especially not in the near future.  
Still, as you said, the presence of ramps can easily turn something that'd be severely disabling in a world without ramps into something that is still an issue but not nearly as disabling as it could be. As such society always plays a major part in defining disability and the severity of it. 

If you can avoid all situations where you would truly be disabled without bending over backwards...to what extent can you still say that you're disabled? Everyone has thing they are incapable of doing, typical ones may involve things like drawing or higher calculus, but if you can avoid things that would lead to your ASD related weaknesses becoming an issue with the same ease that others can avoid having to confront their inability to draw the only line that would truly be drawn is ""typical"" weaknesses and ""untypical"" weaknesses (disabilities).

Just in case you try to paint me as some strawman, I'm not about to claim autism isn't a disability for most\* people that live with it, wheather they acknowledge it or not, just that the extent to which it is is still highly dependent on the environment. 

I'd also say that while a complete change of every aspect of society to cater to our needs is unrealistic, things could improve a lot if the opinion of the general public changed and people overall were more tolerant of differences, something that would be hard to achieve but in the end would benefit just about everyone by allowing them more freedom.   
To some degree that change has already happened and I'm not about to pretend that that won't be something that society as a whole will always struggle with due to out origins, but it seems to me like it'd be the one way that 

Personally, besides the fact that I'm still waiting on a diagnosis, I would still hesitate to call myself disabled (at least, based on what I experience now) simply because I don't really see my issues as severe enough to warrant that label in ""normal"" conversations where it is not only viewed as a huge deal by society but may also downplay the issues of so many people that have it far worse than I do.  
Depending on wheather or not my working hypothesis turns out to be correct I may consider it in more topic based conversations where people are aware that the term disability covers a wide spectrum of impairments and impairment levels.  
One thing that does strike me as interesting and that I should probably bring up now is that this conversation is happening between somebody that uses and sees language as the basis on which we build our reality and someone (me) that sees language as something that describes and changes our view on reality but that does not necessarily make reality itself.  
So when I say ""I hesitate to call myself disabled"" I'm not talking about denying that I have difficulties that may be considered severe enough to be called a disability, but about not considering that word to be the one that would give the general population the right idea of what I'm actually talking about and something that may give them the wrong ideas if I were to use it in a conversation where the extent of impairments that are covered by the word disability are made clear.  
So to me, this isn't about ""Am I disabled"" or ""Am I not disabled"" as much as it is about ""Would the word disability be something that'd convey that I want to convey in this situation?"".

And yes, I'm aware that this kind of viewpoint often puts me far outside what most would consider to be ""normal"" in any way, shape or form and makes conversation often difficult, lengthy and/or riddled with misunderstandings if not straight up impossible on the level where I could actually convey what my opinion on it is without dumbing it down to the point of it being essentially not my opinion anymore. But to be honest I'd consider that a fair price in exchange for not having to rely on a binary understanding of most issues.

&gt;it causes misalignment to the rest of society.

That is certainly true, how much of an issue that misalignment is and how misaligned we/you are in the first place is another question that does depend on the society.   
This is not to say that you wouldn't be disabled in any place you'd go to, but the degree to which ones weaknesses impact one definitely varies a lot. 

If one finds oneself in the lucky position of barely being faced with these weaknesses at all or experience them to a degree that doesn't have a meaningful impact I suppose they may very well say ""I'm not disabled"" and be...not wrong about it. Not necessarily right but also not exactly wrong.

This is great advice. So often the suboptimal route is chosen, sometimes due to cost or convenience, however we are setting up children for life here. Optimal should always be first choice. Kids with special needs are especially sensitive to these choices.

Apparently some children show very little in this area and ST is delayed till progress in other areas comes out. OT was recommended, as was ABA. Both these seem relatively similar, building life skills. They've reached their conclusion, and written letters of recommendation. A full report is being put together. I'm happy we got this rolling before preschool, I hope with effort we can get to a good point for his first year of school.


&gt;Acceptance will come, but this doesn't mean you won't demand them to excel. Yet, you need to know his boundaries and be very aware of his strength. I wrote a lot about my kids here. Every kid is different, so you have to look for yourself.


Thank you. Yes, I will support them to excel, my worry is the interpretation of him by the ignorant, assuming he's not as intelligent as he is. I will have to find a way to deal with this, most likely explain to him how he works differently than many people and how it can be both a good thing and a challenge. I can't address every person he comes into contact with, but definitely can build him up to take on this challenge.

Thank you for the education recs.

[],ScannerBrightly,,,[],,Parent of Autistic child,dark,text,t2_3lpz3,False,,"&gt; He isn't a set of signs or indicators. How do they have the temerity to think they can assign labels or know what he is?

First of all, the label is NOT an identity. It's a convenient handle us humans use to talk. And while your son ""isn't just a set of signs"", his _actions_ do fit a set of indicators. Does that make sense? 

What I mean is, last week, your son was your son. The day after the test, he's still the same kid, but not there is a word you can use to open up doors to help him you would not normally get access to. Use them! My kiddo was diagnosed just days before turning 3, and I 'mourned' for the kid I thought I was raising. But today at 6 she is blossoming into a an even more amazing kid than I thought I had at 3. Not only is she doing more group play, but she is enjoying it, and not only is she smart, but she might be smarter than me (a self professed nerd) in some ways. 

Early intervention has been extremely helpful. Heck, even just the other day, she was going thru a bunch of 'social story' cards with examples of interactions with the back having the 'correct way' to deal with them. ""If two adults are talking and you want their attention, what do you do?"" ""Approach them, wait for a break in the conversation and then say, 'excuse me'.""  My question is: Why isn't _every_ kid getting these cards? They are super helpful to any kid trying to navigate this crazy world we live in.

The other thing that you can now happen, post diagnosis, is altering your parenting style to accommodate what you now know. I mean, you were already doing this, but now you have more of an understanding as to some of the 'why', which is so hard to understand. It's often worth knowing that entering a loud room might only be a moment of 'wha?' to you, but might be several minutes of getting used to it for him. Now that you might understand a little bit more of what's going on for him, it's easier to slow down after entering, hang back with him, and give you both a moment to get used to that loud room. 

So, as you said, the 'who' your son is never changed. But now you might get a chance to glimpse the 'why' your son is who he is. 

Lastly, I just want to touch on 'normalize'. People like me, and my daughter, will never be 'normal', but we are both 'normal enough' to get by. Knowing how to interrupt a conversation is something I use in my adult, work-a-day life, every single day. Knowing that my daughter has trouble with this allows us to work on it now, so that when she needs to be heard, or make a point, she can do it in a way others will understand and respect.  That won't make her 'normal', but the goal isn't normal. It's community. It's understanding. It's communication.",1564694663,{},evqn1lf,False,t3_cknf4k,False,True,t3_cknf4k,/r/autism/comments/cknf4k/my_little_boy_just_diagnosed_yesterday_2_years/evqn1lf/,1564695141,1,True,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],Johnezz,,,[],,,,text,t2_qs0ad,False,,"&gt;As their behavior seems so usual/relatable to you, maybe you have it, too?
&gt;I have ASD Lvl 2. No one but closest fam knows. I have a ""normal"" life externally, but I seriously do not ""get"" most people and definitely not the society I am in.

About ten years ago I took an autism test, scored pretty high on the Asperger's side. I visited forums for a while...and left, life seemed to revolve so much around this thing, and that wasn't me. Plus I didn't want to identify in a fraudulent way as self dx. Had I read about this just a few years earlier in high school, medical dx may have been in the cards.
***
But, this really isn't about me or my thoughts. The reason it's relevant however is to achieve a better understanding of how it is. Because in reality we all tend to forget a lot about childhood. I will not give my son showers anymore, as it terrifies him. Knowing this is huge. Before, I assumed ""it'll pass,"" however this is not the case. Baths and a quick and gentle pour of water on the head. I will respect food boundaries. Certain foods make me nauseous, I imagine experimentation is going to change tastes, but it appears he simply does not want anything to do with squishy foods. I'm doing fine in life, he will be fine as well if he doesn't want a certain texture. I respect it. The therapists suggestions will be tried, however I suspect no amount of ""playing and putting toys in his food even!"" is going to quell that gag reflex. 
&gt;My whole life I have done things differently and was always told how I am wrong, screwing something up (even processes that worked better/were more efficient, less wasteful...simply rejected because they were different), ostracized by parents of schoolkids for not being normal, being weird, alien, odd, dorky, stupid, stuck-up, irresponsible (for sharing information)... so I regret not protecting him as well as I should have early on. He and I battle depression.

This I know too well. There simply was no way to be ""right"" it seemed, as every time it was interpreted as questioning authority. Life was a battle as a kid, I sometimes wondered when it would all end, truly exhausting. At the same time my mother was probably battling anxiety and was highly sensitive as well. Bad combo. With this education however, wow the doors are wide open. It feels like a fresh and sparkling start, bright future. My kids will not know of the harsh treatment that comes with being slightly odd. Will not be punished for things out of their control. And will be encouraged to pursue their strengths and own happiness. I don't care about ""A's"" and ""friends"" if he's going to be miserable. I'll be happy if he's got one friend, builds model space craft all day long and barely passes with ""C"" average if he's fulfilled. I have a feeling if needs are met he'll excel however.

&gt;Please do research so you know what autistic people feel about whatever therapy or help is offered.

I have and I will. I've already received an education of sorts regarding ABA. I am enrolling my son, as there are mixed views, however if forceful techniques are tried or if they focus on stupid aims like ""quiet hands"" or forcing certain textures on him, I'm yanking that. Honestly I'm not sure of differences between OT and ABA, as OT seems to accomplish many of the goals ABA seems to go over.

I giess many here have no idea what we are talking about. :-)

40+ and lonely. Auw. That's me. I do have friends, but mostly in name. They call me friend, but they are more like acquaintances. They never invite me over. And I don't think I share many interests. E.g. most of them work, where I cannot. So that always makes me feel...less useful. Even when I was young my friend would come to my house and at some point, he was talking to my brother more than to me because they were both working and sharing stories. 

I always was shy. But in fact it was the autism. I have always been afraid of people because I also grew up in a dysfunctional family. So I don't trust people easily.

I agree that most of these tips are not helpful at all. My problem is I am afraid to go anywhere. And all the help I have gotten in the last 5 years and longer than that have never really addressed this issue. They don't give medication for it either.

A shrink told me once it was part of autism. But on here many don't have anxieties at all, or no more than normal people have it seems, or, when they have them, they overcome them. That never seems to work with me.

The last real friends I had was decades ago. One moved abroad. The other couldn't handle my depression and did not or could not be there for me in my desperate hour of need. And I felt betrayed. It traumatized me. Trusting is already hard, but after that I never wanted to go deep with a person again. I think for spectrals it hurts much worse.

If you've been diagnosed by competent doctors, then your diagnoses are valid. Some people have a lot. I don't feel like I'm faking it at all because I have read about all of those disorders, suspected myself of having them, and been diagnosed via thorough evaluations. I told my doctors I was concerned about the scientific validity of my diagnosis, and my therapist agrees with my labels.

I would recommend you seek a diagnosis of PTSD if you suspect yourself of having it. There's nothing wrong with having ""too many"" mental disorders, and comorbidity is common. The more accurate your diagnosis, the better your treatment will be. PTSD is rather treatable, good trauma therapy is really powerful, and trauma often underlies other issues, so getting it treated can have a major effect on your overall functioning. Before being diagnosed with PTSD, I though my anger, agression, and inability to trust or connect with people was because of my autism. After starting trauma therapy, I still have problems in those areas but I'm much less prone to anger and I feel more social and less isolated, even though I'm still autistic.

My childhood was terrible. I felt completely and utterly alone. My parents were addicts and were too busy to care for us children. Then at school, I couldn't fit in and couldn't understand why. It was like I was an alien from another planet. I didn't figure out social norms until high school. I've spent the last ten years figuring out how to pass as normal. Now no one can tell I'm not normal, except for those closest to me and those I don't have to wear a mask around. I'm now an addictions counselor at a rehab. From all accounts, I'm a successful normal adult. But the thing is that you don't grow out of Autism, because it is the brain and processing system. 

What this means is that I think differently than everyone else. I am detail orientated, I see the things that no one else does. I am interested in why people act the way they do, what it means to be human, and how we can raise our children to love others workout regard for their religion or skin color.

As a child, I wish I had parents who loved and accepted me as I was. I wish I had had a structure that was healthy, loving and kind to live in... That I could have grown and succeeded in. As a child, I did not need my parents, teachers and community telling me that I was bad, not good enough and needed to change, because that made me into an adult who still never feels good enough.

I guess I just hope that you treat your child with respect, love and raise her with humility. She has many ways of seeing the world that you could never imagine. Please support and love her as she is.

It seems as though we want a diagnosis to explain things that we do, experiences that we have or other things. It sounds as though you are in the same category as me. I have observed that oftentimes a diagnosis is simply but the first step. Being on the spectrum may or May not have led you to the choices you have made and experiencs that you have had. However, in the end it will be up to you to change your behaviors that have been causing you issues, or come to some sort,of agreement with your wife and partners regarding issues that are causing difficulties.

Basically, I am saying that having a diagnosis may help explain things but in the end it will be up to you to decide whether you wish to change these behaviors and if so, to create a plan for doing so.

So to answer your original question, I think despite whether or not you obtain a diagnosis, I think counseling would really assist your partners in figuring out a plan of action for the future that will satisfy all of you.

A lot. I've yet to find support that lets me do more than barely remain alive, and the demands of keeping an apartment habitable, personal hygiene, eating, and leaving the house twice a week were so much I just had a really bad burnout and now am even less able to do the same things that still must be done to remain alive.

A trifecta of cognitive processing differences, sensory processing differences and C-PTSD. Time passage, executive functioning, autistic inertia, breaking down a task into steps arranged in an order of priority, lack of adequate proprioception (and resultant physical disabilities) and interoception, water is extraordinarily painful to drink and touch, and many foods are too.

OK, assuming you are a peer, it sounds like you have difficulty with confrontation and expressing negative emotions. Maybe that's something you were discouraged from doing in your own family growing up. I was too, so I learned that I had to continuously stuff my emotions down deep just to function on a daily basis. And, that causes problems because you wind up with so much built up emotional crap stuffed so deeply inside you that any little annoying thing will set you off and make you feel like you're going to snap. 

This might be something you can work on with your therapist - how to express negative feelings in a healthy, productive way. Just because these peers are autistic does not mean you have to refrain from telling them when something annoys you. Like the girl playing the video game - it's totally Ok  for you to *tell her* that it's annoying you that she keeps stopping the game. She's probably clueless that you're bothered, but if you told her she would probably try to knock it off. But she'll never know if you don't tell her.

The dude with the crappy song - you should probably just keep that one to yourself. 

The ones who constantly interrupt and talk over - well, having back and forth conversation is something that people with autism are notoriously bad at because they lack the ability to read the cues that tell them that it's their turn to talk.

Within the context of the show he's described as being exceptionally mild / high-functioning / whatever.  It's always a surprise to other characters in the show that there's something different about him, but his problems aren't consistent with that and as a viewer it'd be pretty obvious there's something up with him.

Everyone with Autism can relate to Sam because everyone with Autism does some of this stuff to a degree.  Just not all of it, all at once while still having a fairly normal tick-box upbringing.

It'd be impossible to imagine Sam going to college independently far from home.  It's just far too risky in so many different ways (Aggressive Meltdowns, Picked up by the police, breaking and entering his crushes house, Sexual Relations in the School Dance etc.)

This creates all sorts of false impressions for viewers.  The biggest is that the subtler forms of Autism (e.g. Asperger's) are quite visible and obvious.  This can make it seem implausible that real people with realistic problems are Autistic wherever they exist on the spectrum.

This is partly the fault of the Drama format.  He's obviously what the shows about and a central character.  That means that every episode they need to focus on some different Autistic behavior and it needs to be severe enough to make it interesting.

It's a common enough triat with fellow people on the spectrum that I presume you may have experienced it at least once, or are aware of it.

 Well a good analogy (in my opinion) is to think that your mother is thrown by it. She had a plan or expectation that when she died her children would be alive and well. As such having two of her son's die have thrown her, it may not seem logical to you but to her she expected it and thought is a logical plan or expectation.

4) are you talking to her and listening to her and learning about her? Support isn’t about caring and giving. It’s also about listening and learning. 
5) weird that she’s a senior and they want an IED now. Does that mean more than a year of IED education? If not, I think it might be unnecessary, unless she does like the idea and wants it.

One adaptation, which most humans naturally possess, is the capacity for unconditional love. It is incredible how many mothers will insist their kid is a good kid, even if they have a very long string of  criminal convictions.

Despite any recklessness on your brother's part, the extreme grief of a mother is almost inevitable. Having come from the animal kingdom, one of our natural traits is expecting children who survived adulthood to outlive the parents. The emotional bond of protection can last a lifetime, and the grief stemming from unconditional love doesn't care about circumstances. Only that one's offspring has died.

Best not to bring anything up regarding the circumstances: to your mother, the only thing that matters is that your brother is dead. Do what you can to comfort her, agree with her that it is tragic and let her have the time she needs to process the grief. It can take a very long time.

Another thing to note is that when any regular person dies at a relatively age, they are always given glowing praise in the media, unless they were a hardened criminal or despot. The emotions of those left behind are often fragile, and saying anything bad is like adding insult to the injury of loss.

Instincts can be very powerful, and few are as powerful as the parental bond towards children. Had this not evolved as a common trait, fewer children would survive.

Sometimes people in our lives don’t want to talk to us about things or let us help them, and that means we can’t simple as that. I have spent 2 years helping a girl I loved but it never helped because she didn’t want to be helped.  Recovery takes both sides.

Part of that is a generational thing and yes there's nicer ways to decline a social interaction but a child is allowed to decline touching/talking if they don't want it, regardless of being autistic or not.

Grandma is not entitled to attention from a child. Grandma needs to be an adult and accept that your kid, like any person, may not want to interact with her.

I was a kid who was a lot like your daughter. The more boisterous, loud and invasive a person was the more I'd avoid them. My mom always recalls that one of my great grandmothers was very boisterous and would talk in a high pitched voice and always attempt to make very animated gestures, get close to me and be very huggy.

I would see her/hear her voice and immediately begin screaming and crying.
She...she died a few years ago and even as an adult the way I felt around her never improved. The way she acted and the sound of her voice still set me on edge and scared/startled me.

In short, the family members who respected my needs/particularities and adjusted to me are ones I got and remained close to. The ones who refused or got offended...we were never close. I might explain that to your mom, if she respects your daughter for who she is/what she needs and adjusts her behaviour she may well get to have a relationship with her grandchild.",1535669609,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e54gj5z,False,t3_9bnszv,,False,t3_9bnszv,/r/autism/comments/9bnszv/toddler_does_not_want_to_talk_to_grandma_grandma/e54gj5z/,1538499985,14,True,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,1535670071.0,,1509165302.0,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1.0,4014.0,r/autism,public,,,,,,,,

Instead of trying to build specific spaces, why not ask ""How and What could be done to accommodate autistic people here?""

Such as this is a solid idea and gives autistic people feelings of being included. Are there any amusement parks or carnivals that you could propose this idea to? Is so they would likely be into the idea! Though before you start contacting them you'll want to consider making a [pitch document](http://eventjuice.co.uk/pitching-for-events-5-tactics-to-enhance-your-next-pitch/)  As just sending them an email will do nothing. With a pitch document it shows that you understand what you're presenting and you're the knowledge repository for that project.  With that you would be able to effectively communicate what an event geared towards autistic people could look like, how the park could do to accommodate autistic people, and what the park/amusement company could get in terms of value (Such as potential profits, increased brand awareness etc). You could even get some support within the amusement parks company.

I do still find myself a little confused, though. The only reference to autism possibly being cured, at least here, is in a statement by someone who I am similarly confused by, as there was no actual mention of a cure being sought here. Not by OP or otherwise. 

There have been a few responses so far that discussed uses for CBD and/or other cannabis components in helping aid an individual with stresses associated with autism, or even just associated with this insanely chaotic world in general. But nothing, so far that I can tell, attempting to cure or remove autism from any particular individual. I certainly would be skeptical about any such claim, as I would probably agree with it being unlikely for any mechanism related to cannabis to permanently alter the functioning of an individual's brain or entire body that would essentially make them ""neurotypical"".

Though, the rigid nature of some of these statements in opposition to the use of cannabis to help treat symptoms that individuals might be experiencing could cause some people to avoid using it, without ever learning whether it could potentially help them in any way.

For anyone interested in learning about the potential effects cannabis can have on the body I might recommend taking a look at this article as a starting point. 

https://www.leafly.com/news/health/autism-and-cannabis-heres-what-the-science-says

Just a warning, it is a bit lengthy, and contains a video that is an hour and 14’ish minutes. The video also has some auditory problems. ( e.g. rubbing of the microphone, dropping of the microphone, ambient noise, etc.) Otherwise, the video is a nice addition to the text, despite the fact that they leave the last 14-20 minutes in the video even though the talk is over at about the one hour mark. I would hope that anyone intrigued by what is stated in the article would continue to research elsewhere as well, but I feel an equal view is provided for both sides of the debate against/for medicinal cannabis, and particularly for autism as that is one of the core focuses of the article.

Also, I really dislike that the doctor seems to have ""patented"" some treatment utilizing cannabidiol (CBD) as if he should be profiting from something that people might very well be able to learn to properly and responsibly make themselves. So, apologies for some of his behavior there. I really wish people weren't so obsessed with making a dollar on everything they do and especially things that seem to help people.

Please let me know if I possibly missed something important in my response. Thank you again.

,aspie_v_aspie,,,[],,,,text,t2_a3rydgo,,,"I apologize for the length. This has evolved a little as I wrote and while I considered how best to display the relevant point here.

Just to clarify again, autism is more of a disability, not an illness, though it might be more accurate to term it a ""condition"". Mental illness is entirely incorrect for it, as autism is not like depression, anxiety, bipolar, etc. Having autism and then being forced to deal with the non-autistic world can certainly cause an individual with autism to display increased amounts of stress and behaviors commonly attributed to autism as well as other mental health conditions. These behaviors might include; repetitive activities, confusion in conversations or interpreting instructions or information, ""sensitivity"" to sensory input, and a potentially different view regarding most social ""traditions"" or colloquialisms. Which could be good to look up, colloquialism, if you're unfamiliar. This is also not saying that someone with autism does not actually have one or more mental health conditions outside of autism. It is entirely possible, just like it is possible for you or anyone else to have such mental health conditions.

It would be very difficult to attempt to provide enough information that would not include some generalizations, so I will not try to completely explain everything about autism.

Consider the term Tetrachromacy, which, if you're not familiar with it, I recommend looking it up if you have the time. You'll find more detailed information than what I'll find suitable to fit into a single post here. Ultimately, though, it is a condition that allows the viewing of additional ranges of visible colors. Mostly present in fish, reptiles, birds, and insects, but also found to be potentially present in some seemingly small portion of the human population. There is one documented case, so far as I am up to date on the topic, that shows an individual having the genetic markers for this sort of variation in eye structure.

Now, the person with the above genetic markers for these additional ""cones"" in their eyes does not have an illness. It could certainly be called a ""condition"", but they are not ill. The only real difference in their experience of the world around them, compared to say yours, would be that they might see colors in the world that you or others are potentially unaware of. Otherwise, their experiences and differences are completely manageable. Yet, if Person A was unaware that  Person B had tetrachromacy and Person B started explaining what they saw, Person A might very well think Person B was crazy. Though, this would not be correct, it would simply be that the person without this ""condition"" was, for some reason, unaware of these actual, real, things that were being noticed by this other person. This would, essentially, be the only reason Person A would think Person B was strange, weird, crazy even, because Person A was seemingly unaware of what might actually be there and they were taught by people who were also likely unaware of these colors. So, nothing in Person A's life prepared them to consider that they might be missing something, and yet, in this example we know that this is occurring.

So, if we circle back to an individual with autism, the example is similar. They don't necessarily feel stress, anxiety, depression, etcetera, JUST because they are on the autistic spectrum, but more likely they feel things like this because of what they are seeing, or otherwise experiencing, in the world around them, in the world around you. By which I mean, both the physical reality we all live in as well as the ""assumptions"" the people around us live with. Assumptions like; This sound is loud but not harmful, why is this ""autistic"" individual having such a hard time with it?, This chair is a little dirty, but it feels fine to me, why is this ""autistic"" person having such a hard time with it?, I only touched this ""autistic"" person on the shoulder to show them I liked them, why are they having such a hard time with it?, I'm just making jokes with this person, why does this ""autistic"" person not seem to understand what I am attempting to say?, This is just what the law is, why is this ""autistic"" individual so confused by it?

These sorts of assumptions are pervasive in our world because people are mostly unfamiliar with the experiences of someone who might be on the autistic spectrum. Yet, just as the individual who can see additional colors, the ""autistic"" individual is not making up, or otherwise experiencing, things which are not there. They are simply experiencing it differently. They might have physical sensations that occur seemingly without some sort of physical stimulation, or ""normal"" physical sensations might linger within their nervous system for longer; seconds, minutes, hours, maybe even for days at a time. There might be thoughts running in and/or out of their mind that others might not have considered.

If you can, imagine being persistently aware of every physical sensation you have had in an entire day, everywhere you have been touched or everything you have touched. Consider all of these sensations just sitting there, building up all over your body. If you find that difficult to imagine, then I ask, how might you expect to view someone who acts or reacts because they do feel something like this? You might think they have something wrong with them, maybe they are mentally ill, or just crazy somehow. Though, as we've covered, there is nothing ""crazy"" about it, they are only picking up on things that you are likely missing, or quickly forget about.

Now, again, I apologize for this long wall of text, but I wanted to show in some manner that the individual from your class has no reason to hide what he experiences. That is, no reason to hide it other than the fact that people seem to think he is crazy simply because he is wired by default to be more ""aware"".

So, while I won't speculate on why they told everyone in their class (though it seems rather obvious to me), I will say this, do you understand what this person is experiencing? If you don't seem to be able to honestly say that you fully understand them and what they are seeing, feeling, etc., from the world around both of you, I might recommend simply asking them what they are experiencing, in individual moments, or over an entire day. I can almost guarantee they will share something with you that you've likely never considered, despite walking right past it.

Do you think you feel comfortable introducing yourself and asking them what they experience?",1535644811,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e53p9if,False,t3_9bgboa,,True,t1_e53bf8q,/r/autism/comments/9bgboa/question/e53p9if/,1538093275,1,True,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,,,1502425382.0,True,False,,0.0,0.0,7.0,13027.0,r/autism,public,,,,,,,,

I find it had a nice texture, and the mint isn't too strong like other flavours. The cashier looks at me weird when I buy 20 packs at a time LOL

As a kid I liked juicy fruit sticks. Not sure if they still make them.  I find chewing 2 or 3 sticks last the longest of any other gum, and would last most of the day. Compared to the others that eventually dissolve and you have to keep popping them.  I'm in Canada though, maybe sticks are still around other places. 

And I used to pop double bubble with the little comic strips like crazy! A few at a time.

Hubba Bubba had nice fruit flavours (I haven't eaten since I was a kid, so I'm not sure if the recipe has changed)

Ice Breakers gum has the realist (is that the word?) Fruit flavours. And they have sour versions too. 

I hate artificial fruit, so I lean towards mint. But I find ice breakers is the most expensive gum. 

Excel Bubblegum (the pink package) is too strong of a flavour for me, and goes super soft. 

Excel spearmint and mint (blue and green) are good in a pinch; but I find the whitening beads make the gum last longer (in my opinion anyway)

Trident I find is too soft. But has a nice flavour.

Stri5e is also too soft and a bit too strong of a flavour. 


If you're looking for flavours try the Bulk Barn (or whatever your equivelant is), they always have the less common flavours by the front with the candy.

And try the dollarstore first. 

Believe me, if you can, like a cheaper gum you won't  believe how much I spend on gum. Unfortunately Costco doesn't sell the kind i like in bulk. 

So this is comment makes me sound a bit crazy comparing gum brands LOL Hopefully some of this is useful for you. Good luck!

,trevize1138,,,[],,,,text,t2_6dn2d,,,"My go-to analogy for high-functioning people like myself:

It's like you lost your hearing in your 20s and learned to lip read. You meet someone for the first time and they have no idea you're deaf as you're conversing with them just fine and have no ""deaf accent. ""

Then, later on that same person sees you but you don't see them. They call your name and you don't respond. Because they don't know your deaf they start to assume all sorts of things about your lack of response. They may wonder why you're ignoring them. Maybe they said something to you in that first conversation that offended you? Maybe you're actually not a nice person and ignore people all the time because you're an a-hole?

Instead of being deaf we have a lot of blind spots for social cues. I'm 45 and over my lifetime I've learned how to consciously recgonize and respond to common social cues and this can lead to a false sense of ""maybe I'm not on the spectrum?"" Nope. As soon as there's a new social situation for me, I get that deer-in-the-headlights look as a response and the gig is up.

At the root is autism. You can continually develop skills to better function and work around or with your autism but the autism is always there. It's even more important to recognize and accept your autism as well as the work you've done to develop skills. If you ignore it the autism will still be there but then you may be fooled into thinking you don't need to keep working on your skills.",1537463352,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e6bt23l,False,t3_9heez3,,False,t3_9heez3,/r/autism/comments/9heez3/am_i_really/e6bt23l/,1539333997,11,True,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,,,1323101000.0,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1.0,21169.0,r/autism,public,,,,,,,,

The best advice I've been given - and I keep returning to it even though my daughter is 17 - is that kids do the best that they can do. If they're doing something wrong, it's not because they're being stubborn or willful; it's because they truly cannot do better. 

I've found it really helpful to reframe my thinking. I used to think that my daughter was being obnoxious and overdramatic because she would scream when someone ran the vacuum, or a fire truck went by. After her diagnosis, I realized that those noises were a truly painful, overwhelming experience for her, and she was responding in the best way she could. 

I wonder if it would help you to change your thinking from ""My son doesn't want to answer questions,"" or ""My son refuses to eat with utensils,"" to ""My son can't answer this question yet,"" or ""My son can only eat comfortably with his hands right now.""

,tyrelltsura,,,[],,Adult Autistic,dark,text,t2_hr835,,,"I see you’re a new aba therapist. I recommend reading Ross Greene’s work like lost at school and the explosive child and raising human beings. 

It’s not enough to label something as avoidance or escape and then reinforce that behavior away. You need to investigate why they are doing that and create a solution at the root cause. That might mean not addressing stimming. That might mean making the adults change what they are doing, not the kid. That might mean the kid gets to be “non compliant” and “win” power struggles. A power struggle occurs when an inflexible child meets an inflexible adult, and ultimately it is the responsibility of the adult to bend. 

Withholding strategies are frustrating for us and I honestly don’t recommend you use them. We aren’t choosing not to meet your expectations, a lot of the time we simply can’t. 

Meltdowns are not a behavior. We hate having them and we want them to be over too. Don’t restrain us during a meltdown unless you absolutely must, otherwise, just hang out nearby and be ready to provide assistance as needed, don’t force deep pressure unless the child has told you previously that it’s something that helps. Provide reassurance as necessary. 

If a child needs to put his teeth in your buttcheek to get you to stop what you’re doing, you need to stop what you’re doing. Children need to communicate in the (nonharmful) method that works best for them, not the people around them. This might mean sign language, aac, being led to whatever, grunts, having things put in your hand, echolalia, I could go on. Do not insist on verbal communication. 


Don’t force eye contact or touching. Those can be physically painful for us because we don’t process that input the same as you. 


Finally, if you really want to be in this field, expect to be made to feel uncomfortable by autistic adults. Read their stories. Read the stories of therapists who left the field.

At that age my son preferred singing to talking... now he hates music, very frustrating for his music loving parents but then again maybe that's why, a small act of rebellion. Anyway he's 8 now and I took him to a broadway musical after a long day of school and art class last night and he did great. He sat in his seat, watched the show, lowered his voice when I asked him and I'm really very proud of his behavior. 

These sort of large group functions have only become possible for us this year. My son is a great kid but he requires a massive amount of patience and understanding. Food issues are normal in my house. My son thought that ""try it"" meant ""no"" when he was 2 because that's what I said to him constantly when there was no way in hell he was going to eat something. He does not like any of his food touching and if I want him to eat in a restaurant they'd better have white pasta, donuts or black eyed peas. Lucky for me he likes drink garnish and mocktails. He loves herbs and gardening. He wants to know where his food comes from, what it's made of and what its use is for his body. He got a stomach bug a few weeks ago after we went to a comic con and now he's obsessing over germs. 

Anyway, it's all good. We do the best we can. I've had to set up a strict routine and that has made life much easier for both of us. We plan special events. I know from reading The Smart but Scattered Child, organization and time management are my weakest executive skills. I've had to change. It's not easy. I'm in weekly therapy. I'm always annoyed with my husband. My kid is doing really well though and that's the best thing I have. 

So my advice to you is watch some of this [girl's videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Bk0GbW8xgvTgQlheNG5uw), accept that your child is different and that's ok, get a babysitter and make some time for yourself, get your husband involved in learning about autism if he isn't already, get your baby into some therapies to help him cope with his big loud world that we have such limited control over. I think OT, Speech and Floortime are the best but a gentle ABA can help you learn how to analyze behavior. Also getting yourself into therapy or a Buddhist meditation group or something may help you stay clam in situations where you are at your wits end. I remember how scary it is when your baby is diagnosed because you just don't know how it will turn out with them. If they'll ever learn to talk and so on. If your son is a happy baby the odds are he's happy because he's around you, because you are communicating with him and he trusts you. Keep encouraging that communication.

I felt irritated about the fact that she wasn't developing the ""normal way"". Plus doctors who seen her said she was doing everything for attention and that there was nothing wrong with her. (I didn't know it is harder to diagnose girls). 

Those feeling and emotions are normal. As parents we all wish that  there was a magical wand we could wave to help our children. Not fix but help them. There's nothing wrong with a child with autism. They just think differently then some of us do.

I have some tips that have been helping me that I can share. I started talking to parents while in waiting rooms. When my daughter goes into appointment that do not require me to be in there with her. It made me feel less alone to know that some other family was going through the same thing as me. I googled alot about sensory toys that I could make or buy. And if I notice anything that got her attention I went crazy with making sure she was exposed to it. She likes animals I got her sound books after making sure the weren't scary for her and took her to the zoo (had a zoo pass.)

We still have some issues (mainly dexterity related) but the right parental outlook and the right therapy program made all the difference in the world.   He's in a regular classroom with no aides and is one of the best readers in his class.  

He is, however, on his 2nd pair of glasses.  Has ruined 4 uniform shirts, 2 pairs of shorts, lost 2 water bottles.  Personal accountability is one of our big time struggles as he gets older.  It's very interesting to see how issues change as kids with ASD get older.  If you are anything like me, worrying about how many school shirts he would ruin while playing with his friends at school would seem like a faint, welcome dream.  So we roll with a lot of mayhem knowing where we started from.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Remember he is the same kid he always was, just like you are the same parent you always were.  Some days will be great.  Some days will be terrible.  Coincidentally, just like raising a neurotypical child.  

If you are in the States, make sure you ask about a respite program if you are feeling overwhelmed.  Well funded states may have this.  

Also... DON'T WORRY ABOUT FOOD BATTLES.  It will come in time.

,Chew-Magna,,,[],,,,text,t2_1lbvrzq6,,,"Keep in mind that this is coming from my point of view as someone who overly abused the drug in my early 20's, for about a year to a year and a half.  This is my personal experience, and it's entirely possible that my excessive use in addition to being an aspie caused amplified side effects.  It's also possible that my being an aspie led to my heavy usage, not only because of the feeling of euphoria you get from the drug, but from the fact that it drops all your internal walls.  For those of us who want to increase our ability to socialize, that's a big carrot on a stick.  

&amp;#x200B;

The most common side effects are depression, memory impairment, dehydration, and water intoxication.  MDMA causes dehydration, and when you're under the effects of it you're constantly thirsty.  What happens a lot is people end up drinking far too much water, which can severely lower the sodium concentration in your blood and this can be fatal. Back when I was in the party/club/rave scene it wasn't uncommon to hear of this happening to someone.  

&amp;#x200B;

The depression and memory impairment is what really got me.  I've always suffered from depression, and when the drug wore off it was only worse.  I also have symptoms of anhedonia, which wasn't the case before.  Memory impairment is one thing that really makes me regret every getting involved with the drug.  Pre drug use I was sharp as a tack.  I never had issues with memory, or focus, and I had the ability to multitask with ease.  Now I'm in my late 30's, and I have severe issues with all these (and I have for a long time).  I lack the ability to stay focused on most things, multitasking is completely out the window, and my short term memory almost rivals the guy from Memento (awesome movie, check it out).  You know that feeling when you walk into a room and don't remember why you went in there?  It's like that, but with everything.  My long term isn't much better, I don't remember most of my childhood (this could be due to other issues), and most of my adult life is basically a blur.  For the most part I still have the ability to retain knowledge about things that I have high interest in, but other things, and even day to day stuff, is basically a lost cause for me.  Luckily I still have my mind, and I'm still a very intelligent person.

He may not speak or acknowledge when you’re speaking to him, but he does understand what you’re saying. Don’t talk about him, add him to the conversation (ex. “Today we went for a walk, didn’t we (kid’s name)”)

Also, get advice from Actual Autistics. They are the real experts when it comes to living as an autistic person. Check out stuff on Neurodiversity and the social model of disability.

Also also, he’s NOT neurotypical and therefore shouldn’t be expected to develop the same way a neurotypical kid would. He eats with his hands? Cool! He’s getting some sensory needs met by touching different textures. He’s a picky eater? Cool! So am I and my husband and a lot of other adults I know and no one makes us eat stuff we don’t like.

We are often very knowledgeable even though we tend to make simple mistakes or say incredibly dumb things sometimes.

May be coldly logical. Situations that usually evoke emotional responses in neurotypical people may elicit coldly logical responses from individuals on the spectrum.

May be easily overwhelmed and more likely to retreat into privacy when stressed out.

Of course, this list isn't exhaustive. This is just a few things that come to mind. I personally have many of these symptoms, but my awareness of the condition leads me to mask them most of the time. To most people I just appear normal. Note that this doesn't mean that I'm cured.

WELCOME TO HOLLAND
by
Emily Perl Kingsley.

I am often asked to describe the experience of raising a child with a disability - to try to help people who have not shared that unique experience to understand it, to imagine how it would feel. It's like this......

When you're going to have a baby, it's like planning a fabulous vacation trip - to Italy. You buy a bunch of guide books and make your wonderful plans. The Coliseum. The Michelangelo David. The gondolas in Venice. You may learn some handy phrases in Italian. It's all very exciting.

After months of eager anticipation, the day finally arrives. You pack your bags and off you go. Several hours later, the plane lands. The stewardess comes in and says, ""Welcome to Holland.""

""Holland?!?"" you say. ""What do you mean Holland?? I signed up for Italy! I'm supposed to be in Italy. All my life I've dreamed of going to Italy.""

But there's been a change in the flight plan. They've landed in Holland and there you must stay.

The important thing is that they haven't taken you to a horrible, disgusting, filthy place, full of pestilence, famine and disease. It's just a different place.

So you must go out and buy new guide books. And you must learn a whole new language. And you will meet a whole new group of people you would never have met.

It's just a different place. It's slower-paced than Italy, less flashy than Italy. But after you've been there for a while and you catch your breath, you look around.... and you begin to notice that Holland has windmills....and Holland has tulips. Holland even has Rembrandts.

But everyone you know is busy coming and going from Italy... and they're all bragging about what a wonderful time they had there. And for the rest of your life, you will say ""Yes, that's where I was supposed to go. That's what I had planned.""

And the pain of that will never, ever, ever, ever go away... because the loss of that dream is a very very significant loss.

But... if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn't get to Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely things ... about Holland.

He’s often in his own little world, but as an only child that happens.  He has poor social skills and would much rather parallel play.  This girl is the o oh one he plays with in both classes.
I can see when he starts to go down hill but he tries saying it’s his thirsty face.  He has some sleeping issues and so I think he’s learned how to function on tired all the time.  We’re trying to fix that but it’s gonna take some time. 
First class he gives some behaviors, second he doesn’t.  Like above I think it’s cause the second is more catered to his developmental level.

I agree with others that what you're feeling isn't unusual. It's okay to have these feelings, and it's okay to learn how to overcome them. If you just go on having them, there will always be disadvantaged people who understand. I'm one of them.

High functioning adult here. We'll always have extra steps, though I find the biggest help is self-awareness. That's the root of understanding what you can do about your situation. For example, you become aware of those uncomfortable thoughts and tell them to shut up, and that probably gives you a sense of control. It's no good that you take it out on your girlfriend, but it's good that you realise this. A lot of NTs don't. You have the ability to do something about it, in your own time, no matter how long it takes.

For me, I'm aware that I learn really fast and can channel my anger into being better with people. I also have meditation, and wooow did this ever make a difference. So I'm constantly going into social things I enjoy, so that I have a positive association with people. Also, it turns out most of them are having it hard too. Empathising helps.

I use my self-awareness to remind myself that I can dwell on how others have it easier, or accept myself for what I am and be patient. This took about 15 years of self-aware work and figuring out when to relax, or when unwelcome thoughts came (when I was tired or low on willpower, or spoons if you like).

Just about anyone in our situation can improve. If you don't, I understand. If you are able to work on catching these things sooner and find ways to keep in control, also great.

It is a persistent and misguided stereotype that high support autistic people can't communicate or are ""completely hopeless"". That's not to say there are no challenges involved, but if we shift our perspective from one of ""this person needs to be fixed/will never be normal"" to one of ""how can I help this person be the best they can be in a way that works for them"", then all of a sudden it's an entirely different game. Historically, high support autistic people have been shuttered in institutions and treated as subhuman, and that stigma unfortunately has had far-reaching ramifications that we're still having to break down.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, the idea of not having kids because you're afraid of disability is common, but ultimately does harm to disabled people. Frankly, there are autistic people who find this notion extremely offensive. Yes, autistic people have challenges, some of them significant, but that largely stems from an unforgiving and misinformed society, not some inherent flaw with the way they are.

The OP asks, “What can be wrong with swaying when it’s not on a busy train.” When I stim, I’m more productive, calmer, and more receptive to new information— I’d be lesser for it if I couldn’t stim at work.

,Emotional_Nebula,,,[],,,,text,t2_1zqv7j8v,False,,"I can give a little insight into this. I know that when I was looking a few months back, there was practically zero info out there on how autism presents in young girls. So frustrating! So I'll try to be fairly detailed, for posterity.

My daughter will be 3 at the end of the month, and we have our first official eval on Monday, but from the four hours of observations we've done in preparation for the eval, our therapist thinks it's a done deal. 

So, things I noticed when she was younger:

* Overly attached, difficulty separating, practically lived on me, would not go to others, impossible to leave her even with family so I could get out

* Never put her arms out to be picked up by me

* Didn't imitate facial expressions or gestures

* Rarely pointed, usually only with prompting

* Fear of strangers beyond what was developmentally appropriate, would hide her face, cry, scream, or even growl when people would try to talk to her at the grocery store or in public (still does this most of the time)

* Was oblivious to or scared of peers, especially, and children in general - sometimes does OK with much older children

* Generally does not interact with people outside of family. In a controlled, office type setting (like the therapists office) she will interact with adults *if she likes them*

* Even with family, will often refuse to interact or get angry when people try to talk to her. She does not greet peolple. Waves or says goodbye only with prompting. Forget about them touching her or hugging her. SHE has to be the one to initiate the interaction in all regards. Obviously, this has in the past caused problems with her not meeting family's expectations for social interaction, with some family members getting offended or thinking she is rude. But, I refuse to push her to interact socially (because I was forced to interact and give hugs/kisses as a kid, even when I did not want to, and I am still resentful to this day).

* Until she was 2, she would not tolerate things like library storytime or play places - anyplace with groups of children were a ""no"". She will go to storytime now, but does not sit through (she will roll on the floor or spin instead) or interact with the other kids or adults. She does not do the songs or fingerplays. 

* Very sensitive kid, sensitive to changes in routine, trouble with transitions beyond what is developmentally appropiate, sensitive to clothes (everything is cotton jersey), sensitive to noise and sometimes sensitive to light

* Loathes getting her teeth brushed (had to pin her down to do it until only recently). She will finally sit to have her teeth brushed, but usually crys. Loathes going to the dentist or doctor, even though both of ours are phenomenal with special needs kids.

* Restricted interests can be different with girls because their special interests tend to be more ""socially appropriate"" - like my daughter is obsessed with dogs and puppies, birds of all sorts. She has some less typical special interests like tunnels, flash lights, and electricity.


* Repetitive behaviors can also be less noticable with girls. My daughter spins in circles, which is a bit less common. More common stims for girls might be things like picking, biting nails, chewing cheeks or lips, etc. My daughter will sometimes line up toys, blocks, or the magnets on the refrigerator, but it's not a major activity for her. She hand flaps when excited or super happy. 

* Her social approach is odd with other kids. An example is that she will go up behind kids and stand 3-4 feet away while trying to talk to them and then get confused or upset when they don't respond. Or another kid will come up to her to hand her a toy, and she does not understand what they are trying to do. She does not seem to make or return eye contact with other kids her age, even when she has the desire to play with them. It's like something is just not clicking when it comes to her social interactions. Lots of trouble with sharing. No cooperative play, parallel play at best. 

* As an aside, when it comes to evaluating a child's social skills, siblings or close cousins sort of don't count. It's very common to see fairly typical social interactions between an autistic child and their siblings or cousins. What you want to look at is their *peer interactions*. How well do they interact with other children their age - familiar and unfamiliar. That is typically where you can see the social deficits. And, peer relations are the skills they are going to need for pre-k and kinder, so if they have trouble in that domain, it's something you need to catch now.

* She is very verbal and highly intelligent, but struggles with pragmatic language (google it) and things like telling whether someone is a girl or a boy. She does not do ""wh"" quesrions at all - she just repeats them back to me when I ask them.

* Rarely expresses needs (like hungry, thirsty, tired). She does not really ask for food, but will ask for water. So, I have to give her food on a schedule throughout the day. She could be melting down from hunger, but would nit think to ask for something to eat. At least not consistently.

* Struggling with potty training. Seems to lack the awareness of the urge to go, and does not tell me when she is wet. She does OK at home with telling me she has to go when she is naked, but as soon as she is wearing clothes, it's like she loses that awareness. So, she is still in pull ups. 

* Pretend play is rudimentary. For example, she will put a blanket over a stuffed animal to put it to bed, but that's about the extent of it. She often wants to ""make her animals talk"", except that means she wants me to pretend to be the stuffed animal, and she will reply as herself in her normal voice. Does not want or can't pretend to be the stuffed animal herself.",1539283794,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e7l9l6r,False,t3_9n7c7f,,True,t3_9n7c7f,/r/autism/comments/9n7c7f/wondering_about_signs_of_asd_for_girls/e7l9l6r/,1540942105,3,True,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,1539292487.0,,1534361064.0,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1.0,46067.0,r/autism,public,,,,,,,,

There's nothing wrong with wanting extra security for your information; we live in a world where information is loosely managed and often used against each other. Just look at politics or celebrities, people get chastised for *name calling*. Its like we never grow up. That being said, VPNs and TOR are good starts, but they often lead to ""honey pots""; people often think they are anonymous on TOR but as you've probably already have seen, criminals get busted (which is a good thing) but that also is a red flag for not being truly anonymous. 

The whole *""if you have nothing to hide you are fine""* premises is actually completely stupid. Intellectual theft, identity theft, and ransomware are real things. You're not off your wagon for wanting to be anonymous online. 

If you're into linux and cryptography, you probably already know about encrypting your hard drive for the sake of security purpose. Apple does this too, but their encryption is really easy to crack. Microsoft's windows isn't exactly encrypted by default. One of the things that I do for my desktop using Arch linux is write a script that randomized the decryption password and displays it to upon each boot. This way I never have the same password for my disks. Each of my working hard drives (I have 23 total) is encrypted using LUKS. I use btrfs and Ext4 with a combination of Linux and BSD operating systems. 

As far as networking goes, its hard to be truly anonymous online. I tether a micro-controller with an added vpn and a passthrough to monitor what is allowed to my system. You know how pi-hole is used to block advertisements from a network level? I do that with malicious scripts from my micro-controller. I have nothing to hide, but I love security.

Because it’s so complex, there’s no neat way of reassuring you that any child you have would only be affected in the same ways as yourself and other family members. 

I also haven’t heard that there is any increased ‘risk’ with older parents, I don’t think it works quite the same as things like trisomy 21/Downs Syndrome where it’s been clearly shown that the chance increases with an older mother. Again, the genetics behind it are so complex and unknown it’s an unanswerable question but to the best of my knowledge, older parents don’t equal someone being more profoundly affected by their autism.

As there is no medicine or cure for autism, how can it be said that after 6 months he will no longer need it?

The solution, as was the case in the movie, involves getting the ghosts back into their ghost realm, and out of ours. First step: drawing a line in the sand and saying ""NO"".

Believe me, we have tried the subtle approach for many years, but his behavior has actually improved doing the more stricter and more stark punishment technique. I am not hitting him, or showing aggression at all. The lines are very clearly drawn. He loves to explore limits and boundaries. Almost always with a 3 strike system, for example, he will learn when the 3 strikes resets, understand the time frame that encompasses, and then know its okay to get up to 2 strikes. He will then use that in his decision making. That is why with some major stuff, like the stuff I mentioned in my post, there is no strike system, it leads directly to losing privileges. I never end a session with him discussing his behavior in a negative light. I always, albeit firmly and clearly, push him to understand that his bad behaviors have consequences, how it appears socially to others, push him to  understand the impact of his actions on others - and end it with a positive twist on how he could of done differently. For example, instead of pushing a kid out of the line because he wants to be first, instead, show humility and charity, by letting them be in front of you. I found for myself, growing up, understanding the 7 virtues, helped. I use that a lot when teaching him.

&amp;#x200B;

But don't get me wrong, he is highly manipulative, and if you coddle him, or show any form of quick forgiveness, or getting down to his level to make him feel better about his bad decisions, and so forth, will result in him getting the thumbs up to do whatever avoidance behavior he did prior, because in the end, the consequences are him getting a soft talking to. He is smarter than the system you are proposing. But this is hard for you to understand from reading my reddit post. It is one of those things you would have to meet him to understand fully.

When my son was diagnosed at 16 months (he is 9 now) I researched all the therapies that are out there. I saw videos of ABA and yes some of them terrified me and some did not. My son started with speech, OT and floor time. He started ABA when he was 2. His therapists made ABA fun. My son used to be happy when the therapist used to come and used to run to his room dragging his therapist by the hand. I can say that ABA has helped my son tremendously. I never try and convince other parents that their only option is ABA. I always say that there are so many other therapies to look into and it’s the parents choice and what they feel will be right for their child.

I live in California and we have Blue Cross. They cover ABA. Try looking at Medical as well.

I'm much better at recognising people by voice/mannerisms or clothing/hair, although the latter is unreliable because some people do change their hair quite a lot.  Because of this I have more trouble with photographs than real people.  I also have a real awkward habit of thinking strangers are people I know.

When thinking about brain development / deficits, remember that your brain learns and develops to fit what you've trained it to do.  So I doubt there's any damage as such, just developed with different priorities (e.g. I use voice more than face, probably similar to a blind person).

,Blenderx06,,,[],,,,text,t2_ryt2y,False,,"Sometimes we just end up with kids we can't relate to. We're all just human and not every personality is gonna mesh, it happens. Its like this between me and my oldest. He takes so much after dad and so little after me that I've always found it a struggle to understand and relate to him, to get on the same page in almost any activity, despite the fact that we are both autistic and dad is actually the one who is not, he will always get this kid better than I do. (Its the opposite for us with our son who is most like me in personality). Its tragic that sometimes frustrations and resentments in these situations can build to the point where the relationship becomes nothing short of antagonistic. There's a saying that the kids who need our love the most are often the ones we find the hardest to love. Accepting these realities as at least somewhat common helps take away some of the guilt, anger, and denial that tends to feed into them.

I strongly suggest she take a step back for a little while, release the pressure, and let you take over completely the situations she finds so impossible, like homework, discipline, etc while she works to simply build up the relationship. Some no pressure, his choice, one on one bonding activities would be great. Just going out to a diner, coloring placemats while chatting over a milkshake together, it doesn't need to get more complicated than that. Embracing/incorporating his stims and special interests would be great. Once the relationship is rebuilt and memories of confrontations are replaced with positive experiences, every other area will undoubtedly improve.

I suggest she make a concerted effort to educate herself about autism, our needs and perspective, by talking to autistic adults, not from autism mom groups (many have a shared mentality that feeds into their victimhood, which is damaging all around).

One last thought, I would look into the possibility that she might be suffering from some form of depression.

That basically means that when you're a kid, you're a lot more 'grown up' than most, and when you're reaching the age you are now, they are gonna start emotionally grow faster than you.

I'm technically in mid-life, but emotionally I've just realized I'm not much older than you are now. That's not to say that is at the speed you'll mature emotionally. I've had some trauma events that have potentially arrested my growth for a decade or two.

The emotional processing center in our brains are smaller or oddly formed/developed, whereas other parts of our brains are over developed (something with sensory/analytical-logic processing).

So while you'll be behind on some things that makes people act 'grown up', you'll be ahead on a bunch of other things that most regular people don't even think about.

as for how long that would take or how severe it would be, that would depend on the individual. let's use your example of stimming - some people heavily rely on it to regulate their emotional state, so suppressing it would result in emotional breakdowns and then total burnout very quickly. others, like me, only really *need* do it in times of emotional crisis, so it could take years for that vague sense of stress to turn into something meaningful. you can still bet on it happening, though.",1528395504,,e0a5e9v,False,t3_8ol8ma,,True,t1_e0937c1,/r/autism/comments/8ol8ma/just_learning_about_autistic_burnout_wondering_if/e0a5e9v/,1532298948,2,True,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,,,1460931883.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,,48426.0,,public,,,False,,,,,markdown

You're probably thinking of *severity*, as in severity of processing differences. That doesn't change, you're always as autistic as you ever were, only functionality changes, because it's an arbitrary observarion of how capable you are right now, which changes all the time.

Also, the spectrum is NOT high to low, it's more like severity of difference on a wide range of individual sensory and cognitive differences. Many nonverbal supposedly low functioning people may have less difficulties on certain types of processing differences than a high functioning individual and vice-versa.

Unfortunately, you don't really get a do-over, so you have to make a bet on which consequences your son will eventually prefer in the moment.  First off, be gentle with yourself, there's no perfect solution here, so good intentions and a willingness to change if things get really bad are the most important parts.  
  
  There are advantages to going to both types of schools.  Some of these advantages come later in life, like how people who were bullied as kids can be more compassionate as adults (assuming they adjust properly).  Some are immediately visible.  And, of course, some things that make perfect sense in the short term have consequences in the long term, so they're kind of a wash overall.  I know you know this, but I thought I'd say it again to reiterate: there are a lot of factors here, and neither decision is without merit.  
  
  If you want to try and get the best of both worlds, you could try to bring your son to visit the other school, or some sort of event they hold.  In particular, look for something with parents, because then you can talk to them and see if your kids get along well enough for a playdate.  Having other friends who think the same way he does can be extremely validating, even if he still goes to the neurotypical school.  Furthermore, if things get really bad and he does have to make the switch, he'd already know some people there :)

I really think my sister is strong and trying in her own way to cut the cord (New engagement soon!) but the thought of her at 40 still with my mom is pretty easy to see. She does live with my mother in another state, they’re basically inseparable whereas I would always “be fine on my own” so I was always left to the elements. It made me stronger I guess but I’m kind of grudging against my mother for forcing so much adversity on me from a young age.

I wish there were some way for my mother to have an epiphany and fix this before we get old and accept it for how it is. But the thought that all this time she’d been making an awful mistake - it could just crush her. I’d hate that too. It’s like we’re all carrying bits of one cross.

I disagree. There's a lot of complexity to the function stack. Objectivepersonality goes into some of it. There's a lot more than just the top 4 functions, loops, shadow functions, and grips. It's an interconnected, linear, non-linear system.

&gt; Yeah, it's very hard to type characters when they are basically cardboard cutouts. Sometimes I don't even try, because the writers didn't try. Well-written shows, though, often have characters who are consistent enough to be typed, and it's something I enjoy doing.

I agree there.

&gt; An ESFP might resemble an INTJ... in moments of high stress, when the inferior Ni takes over.

Or something like the Hulk and Bruce Banner, Mr. Hyde and Dr. Jekyll, Golem and Smeágol, TKO and KO.

Personally, I find Zuko difficult to type. Coming from someone who's been ""raised"" by emotionally immature parents and a narc mom, being rarely understood throughout my life (it never went past a single moment), and being deprived of genuine understanding validation, praise, love, and attention, it makes sense Zuko would behave the way he does.

There's also a huge eastern philosophy aspect to the series as well as Buddhist psychology. There's references to Native Americans and Eskimos, Koreans, Chinese, Tibetans, Indians, and Japanese which are the cultures with esoteric knowledge (meditations, chi, yoga, martial arts, psychonautics, etc.). Zuko is a firebender, so it'd make sense where his Fi behavior would stem from. The element of fire is a reference to solar plexus chakra meditation which uses Fi, and coming from experience as an INTP who's practiced this for about 6 years, it can make you seem very INFP, ENFP, or INFJ at times. With his character development which goes back to Buddhist psychology, his Fe-Ni or Ni-Fe behavior makes sense as he became equanimitous or found inner peace which can seem very INFJ.

That being said, I think he could be an INFJ, INTJ, or ISFP. It's hard to tell.

There is no talent, only skill. There ARE abnormalities, though. Take an NT with no abnormality. Now, take an NT with autism. They have additional weaknesses and strengths. I think there's an X-Man character who had an abnormality thought to be a weakness. Then, they learned to utilize it to their benefit. It still had cons, but they learned how to benefit from it. Autism is the same. It CAN be a weakness, but it can also be a strength if one learns to utilize it to one's benefit just like most things. A person may not wish to be in that scenario, but it's necessary to accept that one is in that scenario.

It's egoic to deny what is and to fight against what one has no control over.

Let me use the example of the date where the girl guessed OP is an autist: You have more than one possibility to answer that.

Instead, I would tell the girl that I usually wait with telling that because it is a very delicate and private topic that I had some bad experience with. [And maybe that I want to talk about such things in private with enough time so that I could explain things a little if needed...]

To be really blunt, when I read about all the bad things happening in OP's life, I couldn't quite feel sorry because it was always someone else who was at fault. Yeah, it is totally more difficult with autism, I second that - but depending on where you are on the spectrum it isn't impossible to get a job, a relationship and so on.

Are you seeing a pediatrician on base or out in town? My son is autistic and we are a military family. Is your daughter enrolled in the EFM program? If not, get her enrolled. Could you talk to your wife about ABA therapy instead of the other garbage? Some people have had a poor experience with ABA ,  but we had great in-home providers and it was really a blessing for our son.  He has never been medicated for anything related to autism, so it’s not a prerequisite to have to medicate your child. My other son is ADHD and is medicated. I will always try any other option before resorting to potentially unnecessary medication, but I’m also realistic, so if that is the best path I am ok accepting that. I wouldn’t deny my child glasses if they needed them to see. Likewise, I wouldn’t deny them modern medicine if they need it to grow and develop as best they can. I’m ok with homeopathic stuff in general and definitely promoting a healthy diet, but your wife’s is not on this same path. Her mindset is what really needs to be addressed. Would she be open to seeing a counselor? It sounds like there is a lot of projecting her own fears/misunderstandings into this situation and on your daughter and it will only turn out bad as time goes on. Mainly by subjecting your child to needless “treatments” and a rift in everyone’s relationship. 

Be honest with her. If you don’t support her “research” then tell her and let her know why. You don’t need to be accusatory. Just honest and let her know that together you both need to weigh all the evidence and options. My husband doesn’t really have a lot of input - by his own choice. ( he deploys frequently and it’s difficult for him to be “present” for the day to day decisions obviously) But he also doesn’t think our children need to be “cured” of who they are, and we always discuss any changes in the current plan together.   I’m assuming she will not allow your child to continue with her vaccinations either? Has she come up with a treatment plan should your child contract a preventable disease? Do you plan on having your kids in public school? If so, what is her plan there? Get her to talk about how she plans to address the consequences of her decisions as your child ages. She is not looking ahead at all it seems. As parents, we like to think we all know what’s best for our children. And to a large extent that is a true statement.  No one knows them better at such a young age. But unless we are trained medical professionals or are well trained and versed in treatments and therapies, we can’t just do some “research” on the internet and call it good.

In the book \*Ender's Game\*, people tend to type Ender himself as an INTJ. I believe that I can prove he is an INFJ, and I believe that his sister Valentine is the INTJ. It's interesting stuff.

Typing television characters are harder, because they don't always have the same writer, and different writers tend to have different takes on the character. Then again, human beings don't always have psychological consistency; the functional stack is ""more of a guideline than an actual rule"". When trying to type television characters, I tend to look at their standby behavior and de\-emphasize outliers.

I also keep the grip and the loop in mind. An ESFP might resemble an INTJ... in moments of high stress, when the inferior Ni takes over. I was trying to type Avatar: The Last Airbender characters a couple of days ago, and I think Zuko is an ENFJ. He's \*usually\* very strongly affected by how other people view him and how his royal family's actions have affected other people, and he's very strongly driven by a desire for affirmation from others, but there have been a couple of times when he seems to not care at all about hurting other people. I've found a theme to it, though \- he still never just hurts people for fun or sets something important on fire to watch it burn. When he's hurtful, he's very pragmatic \- the inferior Ti.

Only if you take a very much sub\-standard measuring approach will any success be a 'superpower'. Because hey, for the severely autistic mind walking into the garden might be a an incredible feat!

But that would be a double standard. You measure all humans of Earth by the same standard or you be a hypocrite, that is basically  what it comes down to because if you don't do that, no measurement for success is useful.

So what benefits are there then? The notion that the autist can be very precise and focus on details for a long time? Well, there are NT's that can do that. Perhaps fewer than people who can bake pancakes.... but for an employer they aren't too hard to find. What else? They 'see things, find solutions others cannot'?

Even if it is true, and it might be, but not in all cases and it requires a specific expression of autism, there are NT's that can also do it. Perhaps a smaller percentage of the population, but probably more percentage\-wise than there are autistics.

So if it is like you say, there are pro's, there are con's, then what have we achieved? NT's have pro's and con's too. If you add the NT's to the spectrum or the other way around, the spectral people to the NT world, there will be NT's doing better than autistic folks, some of them will be above many NT's and so on and so forth.

These generalized statements about abilities of autistic people are necessarily always in relation to NT's. You cannot after all BE autistic if there is no NT background against which you can be determined to be different.

And NT's also (need to ) learn to develop weaker skills and where needed, navigate around them or compensate. Again that being the case, in what way have we made any progression?

I am a realist. Or maybe I am too autistic to be prone to wishful thinking and supremacist delusions of grandeur.

,Vaidif,,,[],,,,text,t2_872pojd,,,"I have never seen that fenced off structure before. Is this part of the safety hysteria / lawsuit complex that rampages society?

Nowadays you see columns of school kids in bright colored vests, mandatory bicycle helmets. When I was a kid we didn't have them, do them or needed them. I think it is all nonsense. 

At some point car drivers won't notice these flashy shirts anymore because they get used to them. And then kids are just as safe as back in the 70's and 80's.

It is not as if kids drowned and were run over by the metric ton back then you know. And a drunk driver will run over a flashy kid with bells on just the same. Hey maybe he likes the brightness of the safety jacket and aims for it.

Look at this. Five adults on four kids plus the camera person. These kids should not be on this platform. If five adults an't prevent four kids from drowning there is something wrong with society. I wish I was back in 1981, when there was less nannyism and less hysteria about safety. 

You know that in Norway (or was it Sweden) kids are allowed to climb trees and play in the woods and omg, go near water! These kids learn to be careful, become dexterous and develop a wherewithal to the natural world. This is now spectacular to many other nations who cannot understand it! But this was normal a few decades ago. Now we have playpens with camera's and rubber tiles and supervision and we want to bloody chip kids for their own safety, as if the child molester has no technical knowledge to turn the chip off.

I once drowned as a kid, it was...peaceful. I got from where I had footing to a deeper part. Those were the good old days, I learned a lesson that day. I was in the swimming pool, my mother jumped in clothes and all and got me out. I coughed up some water and wanted to go back in. There may have been two bath master at most. For the rest parents watch the kids. But nowadays parents demand their kids to be guarded on all sides..or else!

If children don't get to grow up and get a bloody nose at times, they will be sissy's, dependent on safety nets of all kinds and will be made a victim and dependent on the alms for the poor by the government and non\-profit aid organizations. 

If one kid in a school class gets into a car accident,20, maybe 25 or even 30 kids learn a lesson. If they are so shielded and never get confronted by pain or danger, you breed that number of adults who are at constant risk of being overwhelmed whenever something bad happens. 

The world is a dangerous place and it is good to minimize risks...up to a point. After that point there is the risk of extra measure costing too much and your privacy and independence are compromised. You go from a free world with risks to a complete dystopian Orwellian nightmare because only in a totalitarian state can there be such control over the populace to reduce all risks. 

I advice parents not to be part of this hysteria and find a good balance between danger, risk and the goal to raise resistant and psychologically thick\-skinned to be adults.",1528359383,,e09abfi,False,t3_8p18ti,,True,t3_8p18ti,/r/autism/comments/8p18ti/autism_swim_lesson_breaks_out_into_splash_party/e09abfi/,1532283836,-6,True,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,,,1511095910.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,62573.0,,public,,,False,,,,,richtext

If you want a philosophical answer, the more you fight the world, the more you push, the more resistance it will push back. 

You do realize that being autistic has built\-in impairments? You talk a lot about how you want all the things NT's want. You go to college, but that doesn't mean anything. Many people do because that is the paradigm of your society. So if many people do it it isn't special anymore. So you cannot really hold that up as proof of ability of any kind.

You want to work, but most people can. Maybe you can too, but what if you cannot? Are you sure you have the capabilities for all these wants?

I am all for respect and chances. But the fact is the world doesn't revolve around us and we are not entitled to anything more than whatever anyone deserves. We will always be at odds with societal norms and values. Hence the impairment that autism is. If you really want to achieve a better world for autistic people you can advocate all you like but little will change.

Because many of the things you have an issue with are not a sign of disrespect but a function of a much larger issue: economic values. The fact that some employer may not hire you is because most NT's can do that job just fine, while the autistic person in many cases will need extra help and support to be as productive. So it is about profit and turnover and competition, so about capitalist theory and market economics.

Autistic people will have less issues and will be confronted with less problems if society turns away from those outdated and environmentally devastating and climate destroying tendencies. 

We should not set goals that are not achievable. Once I wanted all these things you want. And perhaps I still do. But that is why hope is the most dreadful human emotion.

I may never get these things, the satisfaction from a job, a partner in life.

I would think it may be possible for you to get her out of the house and do something fun. Go for walks? Any activity that is doable?

I could not be who I was because he was to be my role model. It turns out I am on the spectrum, but even though I passed 40, *he never left home.* So it dawned on me he probably has some dx as well.

  First, your wife believes that her ignorance is as good (or better) as/than your knowledge/research.  It's not, but if you want to play nice, just about the only thing I can recommend is that you guys come up with a budget and put the exact same amount of money toward what each parent believes will help.  No talk about trusting, just dollar for dollar equal expense.  So she pays for snake oil, you pay for therapists (might cost about the same all things considered -_-).  The bad news is that's a lot of money down the drain.  the good news is that as long as the stuff she's trying really is just snake oil and not a bleach enema or similar, it's probably not actively harmful.  If this doesn't work, then I'll make you a bet that you'll be divorced in a few years.  This kind of disconnect breaks down all negotiations-it can't be overcome by a single person no matter how devoted.  
  
  
  Second, you have your daughter to consider.  Your first concern is her safety, followed by her emotional wellbeing, and then her relationship with her mother.  Ideally, she should be able to have all three of these things regardless of how you feel about mom, but if the first two become threatened by the third, then it's your job to protect your child and get her away from someone who could do her harm.  
  
  Also, especially if your wife is making such a big deal about ""curing"" your daughter, please explicitly and frequently tell her that you love her for who she is because of who she is, no changes required.  Otherwise that poor girl's going to grow up thinking she's a failure :(

Yeah here's basically where any rational argument doesn't work. She's already committed to a completely irrational concept.

If it makes you feel any better I've looked over the majority of the supporting ""evidence"" that anti-vaxxers have thrown at me. A good portion doesn't have any real relationship to supporting their ideas. The stuff that does support them is either full of obvious cases of flawed research or the authors have so much bias that I know before looking at the study that it's going to be bad.

&gt;I keep getting accused by her of not fully supporting her and true sting her research and the research of the doctors she looks up, 

Shes spending money on treatments that are snake oil and have either no effect on autism or have no effect at all.

&gt;talking about how our pediatricians and other medical doctors don’t want to cure autism because they’ll lose money if no one is going to the hospital for meds and treatment.

So pediatricians and medical doctors really don't have anything to do with finding cures. A psychiatrist or pharmacologist would be. In fact if they did find a cure they'd figure out how to make tons of money real fast. There isn't some big conspiracy between all medical professions that they won't look for cures so they can keep making money off of treatments. In reality it's a competition between everyone to find cures for things so they can get their names written down in history as discovering the cure and making lots and lots of money from the use of that cure.

Healthy is fine the only reason you should remove a food from your child's diet is if they have an allergy or intolerance of those foods. 

&gt;t’s also hard when our daughter’s paternal twin brother has developed just fine, but wife is convinced our daughter has a different dna set that has been corrupted and/or she was born with a guy that doesn’t absorb nutrients like it should.

""our daughter has a different dna set that has been corrupted"" I mean technically true? We know that autism is strongly effected by genes. However it would literally be impossible for genes to be altered by vaccines. Leaky gut theory  is more leaky then what they claim some people's guts are.

,KittenTwitch,,,[],,,,text,t2_78sveh4,,,"Ok, so let's try to parse out a couple of things first and foremost.  Are you interested in dating because you want to be a part of the ""dating club"" and you want to feel normal, or are you genuinely interested in forming a bond with an individual?  No judgments either way, those are just two very different reasons to be interested in dating, and I would say that only the latter is going get better by actually dating someone.   
  
  Next, I would keep in mind that, due to your sensitivity to touch and sound, you might not like the physical aspect of being in a relationship.  Asexuality is much higher in autistic circles in part because we're so easy to overstimulate, and if normal touch is already a problem for you, then someone deliberately touching areas that are much more sensitive might not be fun.  If this is the case, don't get mad at yourself-it's just how you work, and everyone deserves to find happiness their own way so long as they aren't hurting others who haven't consented to it.  If it isn't, cool, do your thing as long as everybody's consenting.  
  
  Finally, regarding the social skills thing: honing your social skills with dating is a little like honing your fishing skills by trying to hook a tuna-better to practice on smaller fish where you don't have a chance of being drowned in the ocean!  In other words, if this is really about you wishing you were better at social interactions, then you should work on making friends first.  Dating builds off of the interactions you have in friendships, and if you don't know how to be a good friend, then you definitely aren't going to know how to be a good boy/girl/etc.friend.

,KittenTwitch,,,[],,,,text,t2_78sveh4,,,"I believe you when you say these things happened, but the fact that you seem aware of the problems they've caused is a pretty solid counterargument to you being ""bad"".  If you're worried about these things happening again, you can pursue therapy (or ask any existing therapists/resources you have) to try and find the triggers, explore alternative behaviors (I snap my fingers instead of harming myself, it's a bit more normal and it scares people a lot less), and try to deal with the reasons why this is still such a big deal for you (the main one is probably perseveration over things you felt like you did wrong in the past).  
  
  Finally, one technique that I developed before I got the support I have now that might help you in the meantime is to adopt a mentality of ""it's not a mistake if I learn from it.""  ""Learning from it"" can mean anything from figuring out how to not do it, to pursuing a solution for the future, to figuring out and understanding why it was a problem in the first place.

Based on what your indicating, I'm seeing a larger issue there than a correct diagnosis for autism or whatever else this child may have. The concern I have is why these parents would have a child who can't function as a 6 year old and think that having him get some tutoring from you is going to correct his issues.

That being said, I'm not going down the, ""These must be bad parents"" road, I don't think that's the issue at all. Either these parents literally have no idea what criteria a 6 year old could meet, or they are in denial. Of course, this being a complicated world, it's probably a combination of both, they realize their child has delayed development, but they don't believe those delays are as significant as they really are.

I think you should sit down and talk to them about what they expect to get from the tutoring, and also in what areas do they believe he has deficits in that they'd like you to work on. If they do acknowledge deficits in their child, see if you can find out how significant they may believe those deficits area.

I fully believe that balancing your vitamin and mineral needs is important autistic or not.

&gt; High-fiber diet, plenty of fluids and regular physical activities

This is dietary 101

&gt;Gluten and/or casein free diet can improve symptoms of ASD

 Sure if you have a gluten intolerance or casein allergy.  Otherwise no it doesn't help. https://examine.com/nutrition/autism-gluten-free-casein-free/

&gt;Promoters of inflammation… refined carbohydrates and refined vegetable oils

Doubtful. The link you provide is just the author's ideas and isn't supported by much. However I've been hearing plenty good about keto for weightloss so if you are interested in that go wild.

&gt;Broccoli sprouts has sulforaphane an anti-inflammatory shown to help those with ASD calm signs and symptoms 

The research into this is poor at best. It might have positive effects but I haven't seen info that shows me that it's so. At the very least I'd like to see a double blind and comparison of broccoli sprouts to a pill form in bio availability. 

Meditation is a good method to manage some of the related issues with autism but it is still just a management tool. A coping method. I use it almost constantly to deal with life in general.

Its different when you say ""I don't feel anything about this."" That is a feeling after all, and would probably be an acceptable answer (assuming you haven't gone this road before due to the writing I'm seeing here).

Communication between ASD / NTs is very difficult and they typically expect us to do the extra leg work for them. It sucks, but being as specific and technical as you can goes a long way.

That said this person might be completely ignoring your direct responses (as in you're saying ""I don't feel anything when I look at this). If thats the case you might want to discuss with them that you're feeling ignored / pushed / etc because that is basically what you're coming here and saying.

After that if they still don't listen, I don't know your personal situation but considering alternatives might be a better idea.",1530124794,,e1e7cap,False,t3_8twjy3,,True,t1_e1e6wzz,/r/autism/comments/8twjy3/people_not_getting_it/e1e7cap/,1532995942,1,True,,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,,,,,1382402305.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,3.0,323.0,,public,,,False,,,,,markdown

,skittles_rainbows,,,[],,,,text,t2_15ex90,,,"You can't suggest a diagnosis because you're not a psych.  Plus, if the parent decides to sue the district, they can come back and say that you said the kid was autistic and your butt is in a sling.  I wouldn't tell the parents to have him tested because a lot of districts frown on this practice (even though it is a parent's right).  And if the district refuses to test (for whatever dumb reason), you've told the parents they can get tested and again if there is a lawsuit, your butt is in a sling.  However, there is the reach around that I use with parents when I want them to ask for any services (including initial services).  

Tell the parents (casually, not in a conference) that you think Martinique is having some problems in class and it is their right to have her tested by X Office in the district.  The number is X.  They should ask for X person.  By law X Office has 60 days to do the testing upon written request.  However, you are not making any suggestions, just letting them know what their rights are as parents.  But if they need the number again, you can get it to them.  Then I follow up in a few weeks and see if they ""lost the number"" and remind them of their rights and give them the number again.  

Yeah.  I know that this is is the dumbest way to things.
