Made me more aware of my social mistakes, still lack theory of mind, had a hard time accepting that my social/life mistakes were my fault, intense emotions, shifting self image to the positive and the negative, resentment of my isolation.

[],,throwawaybabybaby5,,,[],,,,text,t2_4qwg0etn,False,False,[],"My son refuses to go on walks with me. He refuses to go outside. I tried to get him to do the teddybear hunt with me but he refuses. He shouts NO NO NO! to anything I or his brother suggests no matter how nicely we say it he screams over us ""NO NO NO I DON'T WANT TO"" to anything we say including nice treats for him that you'd think he would like. His answer to everything is to scream ""I'M NOT DOING THAT BECAUSE I HATE THE  LOCKDOWN AND I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING UNTIL AFTER THE LEVEL 3.""
Because as far as he's concerned level 3 is not the end of the lockdown because special schools won't be open at level 3. But even before the lockdown he was like this. 

To give you an example of how contrary he is I said ""I just want you to be happy"" and he shouted ""NO I DON'T WANT THAT I DON'T WANT THAT!I DON'T WANT THAT!I DON'T WANT THAT!I DON'T WANT THAT!"" 


The ""professionals"" always keep referring me to organisations and then people from the orgnaisations ring up and say ""we aren't suitable for your situation"" every time. I've talked to four different social workers and they all referred me to different organisations and each organisation we were referred to immediately rang up and said they weren't suitable to help us. 

I rang the police and they did the same referred me to an organisation who rang and said they weren't suitable. I get a phone call once a week from an orgnaisation but all they do is listen and they have no ideas. In fact the last time he rang he said ""well this is what we do in social services we pass the buck."" The police and one of the social workers referred me to CYFS and CYFS keeps ringing up to say that because it's my 14 year old hitting me and not me hitting him that it should never have been referred to them and they aren't going to stress me out with one of their  investigations when I haven't done anything wrong. 

The police and the social workers said they weren't referring me because I'd done something wrong but the social workers and police said to me ""CYFS lots of hings and just have a lot of amazing resources to help with kids."" But this is complete bullshit according to CYFS themselves who have rung me twice just to say they are not suitable and are only have resources to save kids from abuse and don't want to stress me with their process which is investigation. 

The reason I rang police was when he hit me 30 times in a row and kicked me with his shoes on three days before I was due to go into hospital.

 I just wanted the police to have a talk with him but because he denied remembering it and they knew he had autism they didn't do the one thing I wanted which was to just tell him it wasn't acceptable to hit his mum. 

They did not do that. They just asked him about what he'd done and he said he'd didn't remember so then they talked to me about how CYFS have all these great resources to help parents so they would refer to them and CYFS rang to say they only deal with parents abusing kids so all a complete waste of time. 

While I was in and out of hospital three times during February and March there were all these posters on the wall saying ""Family violence is not OK. Please tell someone.""  What a joke that is. 

I talked to three different hospital social workers two of whom referred me to inappropriate places (one referred me to a place that only helps parents of kids under five0 and the other to CYFS again where I got another ""we are not suitable"" call. 

The middle social worker was just very snotty and just kept repeating ""there are no resources for that"" and chucked a shuttle bus pamphlet at me and marched off. 

The shuttle bus pamphlet was completely useless as I'd had major surgery and was not allowed to lift my own bags to take them home but I had no one to take me home but I couldn't carry my bags to wander around waiting for a shuttle bus and bump around on a shuttle bus. No one in the hospital had any answers for how I'd get home. 

Eventually begging on Facebook someone finally offered to take me home. (My husband died) When the nurse asked me why my husband couldn't just take me home I burst into tears. But then I realised it wasn't the nurses fault as I had Mrs on my file and she'd been calling me Mrs the whole time.


All that being said it's not THAT bad I do see him stopping himself from hitting me too hard or throwing things that are too valuable.",,1587700261,1587701905.0,{},foec0fg,True,t3_g6ef30,False,True,t1_foe001t,/r/autism/comments/g6ef30/upset_that_my_1314_year_old_with_autism_rejects/foec0fg/,1587713800,1,True,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,0,[],,,,

Then we got him in to watching bee movie. He was still scared, but there's a great bit about how bees die when they sting so they try not to do it. 

Lastly, we caught a bee in a bug catcher (this is probably not a bee friendly thing to do but we were desperate as he couldn't go outside at all) and we let him look at it in safety for a while (maybe half hour) then released it.

I had a very stressful childhood. I was socially inept, ""gifted"", my parents didn't understand me and it created some friction, my sisters both don't really get along with me because they think I'm obnoxious when it's probably some ADHD mixed in with being on the spectrum

A local place, a few years ago, said they would diagnose adults on their website, I got on a waiting list, then they called me some months later to cancel the waiting list.

I have had lots of therapy for depression and anxiety. Also I learned about some ways to cope, from Ajahn Brahm.

Right now I am doing okay. I have learned a lot about just accepting myself, accepting that many people won't like me, I try to build on my strong points, I try to be honest and positive and hopefully those things outweigh my awkwardness. I use a combo of cognitive therapy techniques and mindfulness to cope.

It would be great if I could have a diagnosis and kind of not live in limbo anymore about it. So I could say to my sisters, see, I'm not doing this stuff on purpose.

My son is very like me, with his attention to detail, etc., he was diagnosed at 3 years old with autism. So I feel validated that he has a diagnosis; if I were a child now, I would probably be diagnosed too. We both learned to read early, we both talk about our favourite topics without too much attention paid to if the other person finds it interesting, and so forth. It means that I understand him, and hopefully he has a better life than I do. It does mean that sometimes I am overwhelmed by him, by how he interrupts my thinking, he just needs me to do stuff for him, like any parent needs to do, I try my best to cope. I would not be great with more than 2 kids, I realize that now. I would be overwhelmed. But we are one and done so it's working out alright.

*a fork

*Where did you pick up your shoes, they look comfortable/nice- or what brand are they? Can you let me know when you see that sale next time, I'm so bad at following them.
*Where do you get your hair cut. Do they ever have coupons? Can you give me the stylist's name/number?
*Send me a link to the music you are listening to, I need new music.
*the printer is almost out of paper, can you pick up a ream from the back on your way up?

It’s worth mentioning that women weren’t diagnosed with hysteria just because they were deemed sexually frustrated, though, most of the time they were diagnosed because such male physicians believed Hysteria originated from a moral (yet also fundamentally biological) deficiency or a violation of good social behavior (“female licentiousness”). 

Take 1840s psychologist Frederick Hollick. Hollick attributes all causes of Hysteria to the pathological nature of imperfection of female organs. In every narrative of Hysteria, male psychologists viewed men at the center of the female psyche, and everything the woman did was defined or interpreted in terms of her relationship to or desirability to men. When describing the typical Hysteric, Hollick tells the story in terms of the woman’s character, and he describes the temperament of a typical Hysteric in terms of male stereotypes about women, depicting her as frivolous, deceptive, and emotional- with these characteristics comprising the total depth of her nature, and also, thereby, being indicators of her Hysteric disease. 

A passage from a piece from Hollick:
&gt; Women disposed to hysteria are generally capricious in their character, and often whimsical in their conduct. Some are seemingly excitable and impatient, others obstinate, or frivolous; the slightest thing might make them laugh, or cry, and exhibit traits they are not ordinarily supposed to possess. Like children, the merest trifles may make them transcendently [sic] happy, or cast them into the most gloomy despair. Very frequently they are made much worse by seeing that those around them have no real commiseration for their sufferings… A delicate attention, and properly exhibited sympathy, will soothe and calm the excited feelings more than almost anything else.

Hysterics were, among other things, women who did not fit into (but were described in terms of) Victorian definitions of womanness. Hysterics included women reporting a lack of sexual desire, or women who exhibited their sexual desire too freely (the latter behavior, despite being the problem, actually implicitly encouraged by and in fact induced by treatment models the male clinicians provided.

Hysteria was, at its core, a way of rationalizing theories of female intellectual inferiority and regulating female bodies. 

One treatment of Hysteria was a hysterectomy, and not based on a woman’s informed preference, but on a male doctor’s analysis of her behavior. See also: Carrie Buck. What this was, at its root, was physical mutilation or surgery without the patient’s consent, in order to modify the woman’s body to conform to society at large, or, to not only regulate her sexual agency (as the agency she had in society, i.e., the potential to produce male offspring), but to strip her of it should she use it wrongly in a way that threatened the comfort or convenience of men.

I have taken a few tests online, and even am currently going through finally getting diagnosed, so I have had a behaviour analysis that me, my mum, and my teachers have all input on.

Most people in my circle family wise are like oh are you sure, like dont get misdiagnosed. Or they're like oh that makes sense. My friends bar 2 all go ""oh I relate to that I bet im autistic too hahahahahaa im so quirky"". Im like ummmmm.

My mum was certain for me, she was warned about it when I was born, and she observed my behaviours as I got older, which matched my dads who we also think is autistic. For me, big things were this horrible sensation when making eyecontact, the way people would respond to me as if I was weird after I spoke, the constant fidgeting to keep myself grounded in situations, my need for routine in everything, and the need for warning when plans change. I would always have meltdowns, and would rarely understand when I was being rude. The biggest thing by far that I notice looking back, that I didnt think I actually experienced, was the speech shutting down thing alot of people mention. I would get home from school and my nan and mum would ask me how my day was and I just couldn't speak after all day trying so hard to act a certain way, and I would be agitated just them being in the same room as me.

I am not avoiding getting a diagnosus as I really feel the need for coping mechanisms or assistance when we go back to school. I have difficulty coping when moving from lesson to lesson, and I've noticed things starting to affect how I study at home, especially since before now I never even studied at home, but since covid I've been really lacking behind everyone else. Like I said before, we did avoid a diagnosis before, but now I just really need that support.

Autistics (including me) have a tendency to gravitate to narcissists and toxic people because we’re pretty easy to manipulate and often have trouble understanding our emotions well enough to know when our boundaries are crossed and stand up for ourselves. And we can’t really deal with conflict. 

I often use my solitary work as an escape from family life. It doesn’t help that autism makes efficiency very difficult, so there’s always more to do.

I’ve let him before where we were taking turns reading a chapter and he didn’t retain anything including the subject (an elephant which is on the cover). So I also think there’s a memory problem too. An assignment was to read very short articles on pit bulls right? And he struggled with getting ideas out of any of the sentences until he gives up.

I’m only with him 2 days out of the week and his mom for the other 3 so I don’t know how she helps him either. It seems to be like this with instructions for assignments too?  My dad has severe dyslexia himself and he can’t sound anything out, just memorize every word. That’s not the case at all with the kid.

Oh stop it, don't be ridiculous. Making outlandish claims like this helps no one and only discourages productive conversation. 

&gt; Behaviourialism and conditioning are valid concepts, applying them in a particular framework with poor oversight is a glorified Milgram experiment.

Huh? If you agree with the validity of behaviorism and conditioning, then what's your problem with ABA on a purely theoretical level? ABA is the adaptation and progression of these concepts into a more integrated framework where functional learning is the primary goal. This ""particular framework"" is not your issue, it's the poor oversight, which I agree with. But poor oversight is an entirely different problem than ABA itself being inherently cruel or invalid, it's a systemic problem that can be solved without changing the fundamental theory behind ABA.

&gt; I'd argue Communism is conceptually sound, but it's the practice of it that leads to very bad situations for those that experience it.

Very... interesting analogy.

To be fair, the RBT license also requires completing a competency assessment by a clinician and passing the official RBT exam, so it's not quite as simple as you made it sound. I actually haven't taken the RBT exam yet (due to scheduling issues from the pandemic mostly) but I did recently pass my competency assessment, and I feel like that's more important than the exam itself because it demonstrates some level of capability in the field whereas an exam is just an exam. But yes, I agree that there needs to be a more rigorous training process for RBTs, especially pertaining to the emotional/subjective side of autism that isn't discussed in as much detail as the pure behavioral aspect. I guess I understand that naturally, but people with little or no prior experience working with autistic people won't.

It's only been like 4 months since I got hired so obviously I have a lot more to see and learn about the overall field of ABA before I can make any definitive overarching claims. My point is that ABA itself is not the problem here, it's a combination of 1) societal lack of understanding about autism, 2) a rapidly growing field which requires an influx of new BTs without companies necessarily having the time/resources to adequately train every single one, 3) inadequate regulations on who should be allowed to practice ABA, and 4) the privatization of ABA services rendering profit as the primary motive for companies rather than treatment efficacy. ABA is conceptually very sound, at least in my understanding.

For clarification: You're autistic, you have had to grow up in a world where things didn't automatically make sense, and thus making an effort to understand others/the world around you isn't really negotiable, you just have to.

Neurotypical people have no such obligation. Why make an effort to understand what already makes (enough) sense?

As I'm sure you can attest to, understanding others can be difficult at best and herculean at worst, even more so if what you are trying to comprehend invalidates your current schema. Most people will not put themselfs throug that if they don't have to, ESPECIALLY if they have no concept of why they migth even have to.

I can partially relate since I have a similar frustration about my childhood. It truly sucks.

Masking refers to when someone is holding back their true self and instead trying to behave how they feel everyone around them is wanting them to behave. The term is often used when an autistic person is doing this to fit in/appease neurotypical society. Fawning is similar but is the result of trauma. It is actually one of the responses to stress when the sympathetic nervous system is in control of things (flight, fight, freeze, and fawn). Fawning means acting however we believe we should act to minimize further trauma/stress and keep ourselves as safe as possible, and then you can also get stuck in a pattern of fawning when it becomes engrained by trauma. 

Meltdowns are when someone acts out emotionally in response to overstimulation and is often the term used by autistics. Flashbacks also bring you to a highly emotionally state that could include acting out but is due to the environment triggering your body to ""go back"" to a traumatic event or time period. You are essentially experiencing the event again, at least in a chemical sense. 

So these are very similar things and really there is often a similar mechanism going on. Sometimes the way you cope with each is different amd sometimes it is similar, so it can at times be important to know which is going on. Sometimes it easy to tell which and sometimes it is impossible. So often both is occuring!

While I’m not entirely sure if this is what you are looking for, a game similar to Stardew Valley is Animal Crossing New Horizons on the Nintendo Switch. This is predominantly text based and there is information within the game about sea creatures, fossils and bugs. There is an element of creativity to the game, and players can build relationships with villagers (NPCs) and express themselves through clothing and decoration.

Although this is a very large game (and the price reflects it), it is adaptable to multiple play styles, depending on people’s attention span! In most cases the language used is fairly basic.

If this isn’t what you are looking for, when I was younger I seem to remember playing Junior Brain Trainer, which is purely education-focused.

i tend to act similar to your sibling because to be honest, i don’t know what else to do. it is very embarrassing and vulnerable to admit that stimming is not a choice, and it’s not possible to be vulnerable when the environment is not safe.

i realize that it’s my responsibility to manage my symptoms, but that does not mean that those symptoms are my fault or my choice. i think one reason why i haven’t taken more responsibility is because i don’t want to imply that it is my fault or my choice, i didn’t choose this problem any more than my family did, so putting the onus on me feels hurtful and incorrect, which makes me want to not do anything about it. 

i probably would have tried using toys earlier if my family actually understood and tried to come up with solutions together, rather than othering and villainizing me and telling me to just stop. telling me that my actions are just me choosing to “make everyone miserable” gives me no opportunity to say that it is actually not my choice at all, and if we’re operating off the premise that i am choosing this, then there is literally nothing i can do. the only way for me to do anything about it is if we first acknowledge that it’s not my fault or choice, and that i can’t just stop. when the conversation is already framed that it is and i can, then i don’t have the option to try and come up with a solution, my only option is to mirror back the hostility.",,1614121590,,{},goipvee,False,t3_lpekv6,False,True,t3_lpekv6,/r/autism/comments/lpekv6/sibling_makes_family_meals_difficult_to_sit/goipvee/,1614283822,1,True,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,0,[],,,,

I have 0 ability to function without masking and constantly preparing for any situation because my meltdowns are so hard for me to recover from. 

For a long time I just tried to avoid all my triggers. A big one is emotional attachments. When I get attached to something or someone I get so attached it’s overwhelming. I am obsessed with my dog. Like head over heels in love with him. And for the first year of his life I’d feel horrific guilt if I left him at home or wasn’t paying attention to him constantly. But I realized that’s not good for either of us so I slowly started to do things on my own. I’d go to the movies regularly or dinner with friends. And I’d turn on a camera so I could watch him when I was gone sometimes to ease my anxiety and prevent a meltdown. I don’t think I will ever get over the meltdowns but sometimes you can figure out a routine that can help balance that terrifying anxiety and keep you still functioning. It’s just a matter of testing what coping mechanisms work for you. 

I commented this on another post earlier but I’ve found lists really help me. I absolutely hate grocery shopping, making phone calls, etc. those interactions that seem really simple to most people are really difficult for me. Ordering out? I check my order a half dozen times before I place it. But every morning I wake up and I make a list now of what types of stressful interactions I will have to do at some point in my day, everything I need to have set up to do them. I even keep my debit card in my pocket when grocery shopping because not being able to find it at checkout totally freaks me out. It’s just a matter of taking everything one step at a time and creating a routine that elevates some of the stress even when someone throws a curve ball at you.

Now that you realize, you may get better at picking up on clues to when it’s going to happen. Like when I hear myself in a whiny voice, I know I’m getting close and either do something to calm down (play with my dog) or to remove the stress (asking my manager to deal with it because it’s overwhelming me). 

I just remind myself that it’s stress. Stress = meltdown, and I just need to work on recognizing stress, limiting stress when I can, and not beating myself up about it. 

As for home stuff, I have basic no-excuses routines. Sunday and Wednesday I take a bath and wash my hair (and I do really have to force myself most of the time). Start cooking dinner at 5pm. Must eat when my tummy feels hungry even if my brain says no even if the time is weird, even if I’m tired of having to ear multiple times per day. Laundry when I run out of underwear... and when the last pair starts to smell or bother me because let’s be honest I can go to great lengths to avoid doing laundry (and it almost never gets folded ugh). Garbage out when full or too stinky (recycling piles up until I cannot stand to look at it anymore). My sheets... I keep meaning to buy grey sheets so they don’t look dirty, as I keep forgetting to wash them. 

I schedule the basic basics and let everything else go if it needs to, until I’m better enough to get to it. Gotta have some compassion for yourself when you’re having a hard time.

I can see how the ""her fault"" comment might cause concern.  If she's open to the idea, I'd suggest she do the quiz as well, however be wary of the fact that this \*could\* make it ""your fault"" - it's a two-edged sword and custody stuff can be evil, especially as it involves finances.  My two live with me now after a decade of maternal ""care"" that was suboptimal for them to say the least.  They are in their teens, and thriving now.  You might want to leave that well alone - you'll be the best judge of your situation.

There \*could\* be a trauma factor in there somewhere, but his relationship to you is different. The big thing for mom to remember is that to himself, he is entirely normal.  It's as natural as a ginger kitten being born in a litter of black-and-whites. Any thinking outside of ""this is my cub"" is wasted effort, really. 

I would go ahead with sign language anyway if you feel there's any potential benefit at all to it - ANY method of communication that works, is communication that works.  You will find that following your instincts will rarely be wrong. I would also consider, longer term, the potential prospect of full custody and have a plan for it.

Basically to sum it up I think for A LOT of AFAB people, our autistic symptoms are misunderstood to be something else- we get diagnosed with more emotion-based disorders because from a young age how we present differs from the standard autistic boy profile.

Since I was a child  I had been terrified by bees and wasps (specially wasps), and it was so much that I started hyperventilating and running around the place just to get several meters away from them. Until I was 13 I was never stung, but we went to a beach and accidentally got stung by a poor bee on the ground when I stepped on her. I started to fear them less when I realised the pain was not as I imagined id, but I was still terrified of bees and wasps. In a certain point, around 17 I became obsessed with apiculture and started researching about bees, their importance and how they behaved and I finally could understand that they're very useful, very important and far from being the yellow and black flying homing stinging missiles looking for someone to hurt I thought they were. A couple of years ago I finally had the courage to attract a bee with a dandelion and just watch her very closely. She didn't not only not attack me but I saw it didn't want to; she was just collecting nectar and pollen. A time later, two bees entered in my house in different days and couldn't get out. I finally throwed away my fear, put a little honey on my finger, had them land on it and took them outside while they licked the honey. With this I want to point out that the more I knew and researched about bees, the less I feared them, so exposure and knowledge helped me a lot to finally respect and even appreciate these little animals. Note that this happened over the course of many many years because the process was helped only by my own motivation. I'd say you can read with your child about all the great things bees do for nature, watch some bee cartoon o movie and, even if it sounds silly, get him a bee toy or have him play games like minecraft (which is quite a lot of fun and a great help for autistic children) where bees are now part of biomes and become accustomed to it. About wasps I can't really advice anything from my experience. I'm still in the ""getawayfromthathellspawnnow"" phase and they are quite a bit more agressive and unpredictable than bees.

Well, the only thing THAT would do is fool people into believing it doesn't affect you, while actually letting it affect you far more than it would now because you're actively working on pretending you're NT and, well, actively working on suppressing your natural way of existing.

It's called masking and is generally linked to an increased risk for suicide, 0/5, wouldn't recommend.

No, but seriously,  if he's in any way open for discussion ask your dad if he's get more done if he had to remind himself to not make any facial expressions, was told to hate himself for making any and was pressured into, say, using fidget toys all the time, especially when working.  
Tell him that ""suppressing autism"" would be an additional effort that would take a lot of energy that you can use for things you actually need or want to do now and that many people who do pretend to be NT actually end up not being able to do anything outside of school/work because they are too exhausted by having to keep up the pretense, that they are thus far more affected by being autistic than they would be if they weren't forced to pretend they weren't autistic.

&amp;#x200B;

Other than that...well, autism is more a way of describing a certain way in which some brains work differently from the norm and how this affects how you relate to the world in general and NT society in particular.  
If you make an enemy of the way your brain works then...well, I think hating yourself/a part of you is generally considered to be emotional self-harm.

Example,  if during a meltdown your child collapses on the floor and tries to hurt himself,  the school staff should block, pad, go on their knees, etc. Skipping those little details means if your child comebacks home with a bump on his forehead after a meltdown-  you can't do much if in the BIP it was not instructed that staff has to go down on the floor with him",,1611200054,,{},gk0vnh8,False,t3_l1eu9p,False,True,t1_gk0ueq2,/r/autism/comments/l1eu9p/my_son_has_autism_in_need_of_some_advice/gk0vnh8/,1611333494,2,True,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,0,[],,,,

I asked my son‘s pediatrician to write me a script to get some blood work done to test for some vitamin deficiencies. It’s so weird, he wrote a script for a test for celiac because I told him that I noticed a difference in my son when I cut off gluten. So I kind of found that odd that he refused to test for vitamin deficiency. But I am actually going to get him tested for that.

I have a true story for you. My friend’s uncle was graduated from one of top university. He got married and had kids and a job as a director of well known company. Then the company went bankrupt and he lost his job. He had lots of debts, couldn’t afford his house, his house was taken, and started drinking habit. His wife and kids went back to her parents and he wasn’t welcomed. He became homeless, living on the street, looking for job for 3 months trying to survive. He repented, quit drinking and quit blaming himself. He finally got a job as a janitor for more than a year. The first year he worked as janitor, he reconciled with his wife and kids. The second year, he finally can afford to rent an apartment. His wife and kids moved back with him. Then the following year, his Harvard classmate noticed him working as Janitor and offered him a better job. He then work in an office until he had his own company. 

Can’t you imagine how long his “process” phase to get out of his misery? From a director, losing a house, wife, kids, and finally got a job as a janitor. A hard working janitor.... Not for months, but for three years. 


Since then, he never sees society as hatred anymore. He helped homeless people to go thru homelessness, but for some, they rather stay homeless like I said earlier.

Genetics is not something you can take a blood test and magically understand.  Believing that these genes express in some perfectly mendelian fashion is a pretty clear indication that you don't have any understanding of the underlying genetics.  This reads like the same toxic crap that every stay at home mom with too much time on their hands has been polluting public discourse with since the dawn of the ADA.  It's only credible because you don't understand it.

Second, you don't understand what ADHD or Autism are either.  Neither is an actual pathology.  Both have a wide range of underlying pathologies with different mechanism affecting different processes.  There's no ""ADHD"" gene for the exact same reason there's no ""autism"" gene, these descriptions have many different underlying pathologies which result in similar ""symptoms"".

Finally, it's also clear that you either didn't read or understand the study you just linked to.  The primary focus of the study was Spina Bifida, however they found ~30% of this group had ""symptoms"" of ADHD, and even more nearly all of those were the ADHD-Inattentative type.

Autism Diagnosis is made up of a plethora of tests put together usually also involving clinical observation of symptoms (But there is no standardised procedure for diagnostic testing.) 

But it's actually best to not know exactly what you go through, as to prevent any bias.**

So it can be for example (there is no standard) a selection of tests such as the AQ, RAADS, ADOS, EQ, symptoms, traits, and observable behaviours. But these also have to be delivered in a clinical environment with someone trained to do them, as it's more than answering questions as they are often (without realising) pushing certain areas to see your reactions/behaviours to see if there really is a neurological issue. 

You can guarantee they'll ask a million questions - but nothing scary, intimidating or worth being anxious about IMO. 

**Then finally as a general summary, they tend to be looking for roughly the following:**

* Difficulties / deficits in normal social communication including verbal and non-verbal behaviour
* Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests.

All she needs is a bottle of beer and she looks like my dad watching soccer :')

Minnie is a very loving and kind girl as well, although very different in personality from Kiwi. My family got Minnie 2 years ago from our local animal shelter, she had been given up twice before finally getting a forever home with us. 

Minnie is loving, although not as clingy and physically touchy as Kiwi (which is why Kiwi is my ESA, I'm comforted by her cuddles and rubs and physical closeness). She only likes playing with three things: a wandy toy, a piece of yarn and a butterfly toy, whereas Kiwi will play with almost anything (jingly ball toys being her favorite). Minnie is also kind of quiet, definitely quieter than Kiwi...when she does meow it's usually because she's hungry or wants into a room. Kiwi, on the other hand, loves to have full blown conversations in her cutesy kitten like voice. She's also such a purr machine!

Both of my girls are rescues as well, so they're mixed breeds. However, I think Minnie is part Siberian Forest Cat and Kiwi is part Egyptian Mau. Your girl, to me, looks like she's part British Longhair or Doll Face Persian. I agree with you in that I don't see Maine Coon as a possibility. Someday I really want to get the Basepaws breed test and see what breeds my cats are.

It feels awesome to find another aspie with a special interest in cats, I didn't think I woud but I'm glad I know someone now who loves them like I do!

Early intervention programs can be very beneficial to children with ASD. I don't think anyone made this an effort to be cruel. I think this is probably something to help people like preschool teachers identify children who might need extra help and then bring up the possibility of an assessment to parents. Without a diagnosis, school districts don't provide extra help to children. (Since there is special ed funding for that extra help, but you have to qualify.)

By ""inappropriate use of toys"" they don't mean morally wrong or gross use, but not using them as intended. So in this picture the boy is playing with toy cars but he isn't using them as cars or for pretend play. I do not believe this is intended to be a value judgment that it is harmful he does this, but something to look out for that a child might have ASD. Perhaps a different phrasing would have been better?

There are also children with ASD who want to play with their peers but don't know how, and benefit from direct instruction and/or coached play sessions with a kind peer to teach them how to do so.  Other things here like poor speech/lack of speech and be very frustrating for children. We mostly all want to be understood and at least able to communicate or wants, needs, and problems.

SAD sucks, my wife has it too!  Do your best to get some blue light therapy.  Watch some sunny nature shows.  Take vitamin D3

Jobs and friends are hard, Corona is making it even harder.

But you may try looking through amazon Mechanical Turk, or Fiver if you have some basic skills and free time.  It won’t for a lifestyle or all the bills but it can keep you busy and earn a few bucks along the way.  Try taking some free or low cost classes to up your skills.  With all the restrictions on travel in a ritual community, harvest season might be a chance to earn some money if usual migrants don’t make it there.

For friends, start reaching out to people you already know.  You may be able to find a small group with similar standards against corona to socialize with.  Think about adopting a dog.  Get a body pillow (lame, but if it’s lame and it works then it isn’t lame).

I've been practising this at the hairdresser,  a situation I always find awkward. I dont really know if I should talk or not, but it seems people feel very comfortable talking to their hairdresser. I started out by asking about the equipment she uses. (very standard as I am a male with a kinda classic hairlook) I asked about the difference in quality and price and off she went... Like devi said , people like to talk about themselves and their life, I mostly feel too uncomfortable to do so.

so I everytime I go I try to ask at least one question and that takes courage,one time her hair was curly and I  asked if it was her natural hair, even complimented her about it.

time goes by and I dont really feel so stressed to go to the hairdresser anymore. She even knows some things about me now , last time she askes me how my gf was doing.

I know this is very anecdotal but the main thing is, try to ask a question about them (maybe not too personal the first time), next thing you know you might be in a conversation and you can use all the clichés you hear from people ;-).

getting misinformation about a disability from a subreddit, which is frankly not a very scientific or necessarily accurate information, could be really harmful if it's being implemented in the care of autistic children by a school organization. i think this subreddit/similar forums/etc. are useful for individual people asking for help for themselves or family members, but i don't believe that it it right for someone working for an organization that is trying to work on accommodating autistic children to gather their info from random people on the internet. everyone on this sub is not autistic, and most people on this sub are speaking from personal experience, which may not always be the hard facts. this type of organization needs real training in this. they should go through some psychology training or something similar in how to help autistic children. i think that is the best way for them to truly make a difference.

This causes a lack of ""common sense"" that is frequently reported of autistics. It also can give autistic people the unique way of problem-solving we're praised (and occasionally demonized) for. However, it comes at an additional cost. The fact that many of us can't just autopilot our daily interactions means we may spend large amounts of mental energy just trying to keep up. For example, I don't instinctively know a steaming-hot kettle is not okay to touch—I have to quickly reference any rules and/or past situations, and convince myself that I will probably be burned. Then I have to figure out how I can get the boiled water into my cup of tea, whether I will need additional equipment, where the potholders are stored, consciously direct my body and hands to perform the necessary actions, etc. Now imagine having to do this for everything you interact with. Sound exhausting? It is!

People with autism can sometimes pass for neurotypical (NT). This is called masking, and it's a bit controversial. Some people say we shouldn't need to mask, that NT people should just put up with our neurodiversity. That's not always possible, though. Remember the kettle? Now imagine you're not doing something so simple as making tea. Imagine you're trying to participate in a meeting. You need to keep in mind every social rule you're aware of. You have to instantly know when to talk and what to say. You have to guess what's the correct vocal tone and inject it into your speech. You have to assume what facial expression would be the most accurate. You have to maintain an acceptable amount of eye contact, which many find very uncomfortable. All of these and more, all while trying to suppress self-stimulating behavior (hand flapping, rocking, etc) that actually makes you feel less stressed. It's, again, exhausting!

This is why I think a lot of autistics have a love of routine and special interests. Routine gives us something we can relax and go on ""autopilot"" with. If you always do the exact same thing when coming from school/work, you don't have to think about it hardly at all. It's a welcome respite from the anarchy of day-to-day life. Special interests, too, let us categorize and organize. It's taking something chaotic—unknown knowledge—and puts it in a nice, neat order. This lets our minds rest easier knowing there's just a little less chaos in the world and a little more cathartic order in our minds.",,1586222955,,{},fmnch9y,False,t3_fvztxt,False,True,t3_fvztxt,/r/autism/comments/fvztxt/im_trying_to_learn_more_about_autism_how_would/fmnch9y/,1586225580,1,True,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,0,[],,,,

For example, when my daughter hits in public I tell her, “if you hit again, we’re going home.” Then, if she hits one more time, which she does less and less frequently now, I immediately put her into the car and take her home. 

If she acts up in the car on the way home, I tell her “if you don’t stop yelling, I’m not going to take you inside the house.” Then I exit the car, leave her in the car seat with the car door open so she’s safe and I can see her, and I sit down in the garage with my phone until she calms down, giving her no attention if she’s acting out. I have a chair in the garage for this purpose. If she cries and asks to go inside, I say “if you want to go back inside, don’t yell and don’t hit daddy. Do you want to go inside?” And usually she’ll say yes and stop the behavior. If she hits me again or acts up, she goes right back into the car seat. Process begins again. 

By allowing your son to continue to play at the restaurant despite the hitting, you are rewarding the bad behavior. Basically it’s telling him “you can do whatever you want.” This is regardless of how much you yell or verbally reprimand - that does nothing. 

In order to fix the behavior, have to take away privileges. Playing is a privilege. Going inside is a privilege. Going into the store is a privilege. Essentially, doing anything that they want to do is a privilege. Determine what they want and withhold it until the behavior is corrected. 

This can be challenging at home, especially with a child who will not sit in time out or hits you. I actually find it easier in public thanks to car seats. Basically you have to figure out a place where they can be in time out that is safe and where they can’t escape, like a crib or pack and play with really tall sides. Alternatively, you can turn your back on him and simply walk away from him for several minutes until he complies. He wants your attention - withhold it.

a tarantula, a snail! snails are great.

these are all animals that are slow like you said. if inverts aren't your thing, reptiles as u/amamiyahibiya said a gecko is pretty good if you want something easy, low-energy and something that doesn't require handling but can be handled if you want. also anoles are cool (especially green anoles) and if you have the money and the room chameolons can be pretty fun. the smaller skinks are cool if you can't get the tank for a bigger skink

amphibians are pretty cool too. newts, salamanders are great but I'd say frogs/toads probably wouldn't be your thing based on what you said. still up to you though

other than exotic pets, might I suggest a ragdoll cat? I've had one and she was very, very lazy and would do pretty much nothing but chill with me. Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs are pretty cool!

bunnies are great for emotional support. they are a little energetic but, I mean, it doesn't matter as much as something like an energetic dog or cat because they make hardly any noise or disturb you much

a group of mice or rats (not bot) can be very fun to watch as they interact but the short lifespan might ruin it

and the final is a praying mantis. I haven't mentioned this because they may not be your thing (flying, jumping, short lifespan, live food) but they're very very fun  and easy to keep. Gustavo, for instance my boi, waves at me when he wants to go back in his enclosure (or just flies in there himself) always keeps out of the way when I clean his enclosure, grabs food almost immediately.

there's so many stuff you can have!

I had a super hard time growing up particularly at your age because my parents weren't the best people on top of being bad to me they also couldn't understand any of my behaviors or ability to do a handful of things really well naturally while being completely unable to grasp other things at all. Around your age I had a gut feeling after talking to a friend with autism and reading about it that I was on the spectrum so I just assumed I was and my family didn't like me saying it at all for the reason of like the oh you're just self diagnosing it thing and for not wanting to address things they can't handle, anyway after  a series of events my aunt took me to a psych and I asked her to talk to the doctor with me since I felt kinda dumb about the whole thing in general, my aunt mentioned my parents and the things she thought I had, telling the doctor I seemed depressed, and that my behavior and thought process wasn't normal she told the doc she thought I was bipolar. I was freaking out inside after a bunch of talking and a bit of arguing the doctor told my aunt and I that I wasn't bipolar which felt great to know not that anyone with it shouldn't feel good I just didn't want to be labled with something I was sure I wasn't, but then she said that I was a very strange guy and talking to me was all she needed to do to figure out that I was on the spectrum. 

It immediately clicked for me and my aunt who admitted openly for the first time that I had been right all along. Having the label helped it felt like a puzzle piece was in it's place. I started to be able to look at myself better and work on my behavior in different ways.

(some autistic people can ""learn"" to make eye contact, but many including me cannot and even for people who do it's a form of masking and is still very very exhausting to do.)

and (2) explain what your other symptoms are and why they happen like you did here.

Saying to someone who's worried about something ""I'm not going to tell you anything about it but I swear it isn't what you think"" just sounds like you're bullshitting and not giving a reason because there isn't actually a different reason. It's also effectively choosing to not communicate at all, which is bad.

Art history was one of my majors in college, and I could never quite find any sense of emotion in looking at some of the stodgy old world masters. It was mostly portraiture, and scenes from strange renaissance times and places. They always looked so somber. 

That said, I now find a much much deeper appreciation for art, especially if the scene is something that I wanted to become part of. Sometimes you can look at something so beautiful, and it just makes you want to be in the painting. Imagination can go along way in becoming a good art critic, and some of us have very good ones at that. Many people with our condition are some of the best artists in the world. Particularly in being more visually oriented, rather than geared towards words. One thing I will say, some artists tend to seek shock value, where others can capture the spirt and beauty of a particular scene. Again, I always look at it from the perspective of whether or not you’d want to be in the image, and how would that make you feel.

Regarding music, I am totally with you on that. Some of the pop and trending music these days is just so incredibly chaotic, to the point that it’s just debilitating. Years back, (20 or so) when trance music first started going mainstream, I really enjoyed it. It has a certain repetitiveness to it, which calms the brain. It’s known to create very zen-like alpha waves.

That said, interestingly classical music a very similar effect. No words, just harmony and melodies, and it’s amazing what good it does for your soul. In due time, you may find that you will acquire a taste for these things. But in the meantime, don’t be discouraged. It’s quite typical for many of us to prefer the silence of a wind machine over the commotion of a radio. I’ve been in grocery stores on many occasions, and just wanted to run for the doors at times, especially if there was some really bad music blaring over the aisles. Trust me... you are not alone!! Take good care, and hang in there. There’s a lot of good to be found in the arts. ...it just may not have crossed your path yet.

Long last excessive anger that tends to stem from something else.

I have theory that disorders that occur in an autistic mind processes other disorders or, to be more precise, traits of the disorders in autistic way. Basically if we can not always express emotions or ideas in a comprehensible way to others then it becomes harder to see traits of other disorders. You have to see it through autistic eyes in order to detect the characteristics of it more easily.

Unlike a lot of people, I have amazing leads who don’t focus on that, and instead they allow the kid to be free, and to be a kid! There are more important things to worry about than a child flapping his hands or scripting. 
On another note, not everyone I work with is like that, unfortunately, but the team I work closely with is, and I’m grateful. However, if that were to ever change, I would continue things how they are. I’m confident in my ability, and my kiddos skills.

I do feel like indica/marijuana makes my autistic traits feel stronger, which can be good/nice!

- You are aware that you get meltdowns, and that it’s possible (maybe likely) that they’ll happen while you’re out in public.
- You went with a friend who could help you out if you needed.
- You decided ahead of time to define a ‘code word’ so you could easily explain it to other people and not have them panic.
- You used the word, and remembered that your friend was going to come back and help you.
- The lady understood what you meant, and was supportive and willing to help if needed.
- You were able to communicate that you were really okay, and she was able to understand that and not override your decision.

I’m not going to criticize you at all. In fact, I’m stealing your idea and will use it the next time I have a meltdown/shutdown in public. Thank you!

You need to reset your feelings and understanding about disability and what it means in society.

It is still your responsibility and privilege make this child into the best person that they can be.

Had? He is his own person. He will have his own hopes and dreams. There is nothing to feel defeated about. You haven't lost anything because he is still your son. As he grows you won't get to decide much as he learns how to live his own life. Let go of the fantasies and expectations and just be present for your son and take things one step at a time.

(the same goes for neurotypical children but it's even more important to remember with a special needs kid)

Things change as they get older and the small things you find yourself stressing out about will only be distant memories. Don't fixate on the diagnosis. Simply take the diagnostic code you get on paper to get him the help he needs. You can still have your dreams about what his life might be but you have to change your perspective. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  But every day is a struggle when I think what else won't he be able to do now? 

Think about the things he's already great at. Don't get wrapped up in milestones. A lot of the ""rules"" for regular development don't apply to neurodivergent children. So you have to let your ego step aside a bit and learn from HIM. Our kids are drawing their own maps to life.

Is he happy? Is he generally healthy? Then you are doing just fine. I understand the constant tug-o-war in your head with doctors and other professionals telling you all sorts of things but it ultimately comes down to what you feel in your gut and what your heart tells you.

Your son will be fine. Give him a chance to grow, he's still a tiny little flower bud.

I would also recommend that you immerse yourself in books and online environments that don't just problematize autism, but rather acknowledge that we all face difficulties whilst recognising our uniqueness and strengths. 

Read *Neurotribes*. Read biographies by autistic people. Follow the #actuallyautstic hashtag on Instagram, Twitter, and Tumblr. Watch videos *by* – not about – autistic people on YouTube. 

Prioritise the voices of autistic teenagers and adults so that you can see that we are amazing people, even though we function differently to others (including your daughter). From this, you will gain great insight as to how to be the best possible parent for your son.

During the hours you schedule be specific. I can put 'clean up my room' on there and I'll sit around not knowing what to do. But if I schedule 'sort the letters on the desk' I can do that quite fast and then go on to the task 'bring the dishes back to the kitchen' very quickly.

I think people assume I’m single cause I’m just some unique and quirky guy who’s perfectly happy to be alone and do things on their own. Some truth to that but what they don’t see is how much I want to be like NT’s with their partners, their families, their outgoing social lives in their 20’s all the things I could never attain. 

Even worse because I seem normal enough people assume symptoms like not talking to people,  not remembering their names, not recognizing them out of their usual context, not making small talk are just me  being rude. People wondering why I’m “so serious”. So now there’s moral judgement on me for things I can’t help. 

All of this results in low self esteem and contributes to health issues, hidden stress suicide, people flipping out and being violent (extreme example). And they wonder why it happens when someone was “normal, just kind of quiet and a bit standoffish” 

Not saying there aren’t people that have survived most of their life undiagnosed that are happy, surviving coping well enough. But it’s neglecting a whole group of people who do need help even if they seem ok

I feel like I roughly remember Maslow’s Hierarchy from psychology classes, but I’m going to look it up again to refresh my memory.

I have considered sign language or finding other forms of communication, right now we’re waiting for this clinic to call us back so we can have them give their opinion as well so we can build a master plan. 

If you don’t mind me asking, what was it that made you twitch? I took that quiz and that was.....pretty eye opening to say the least haha. I always questioned the fact, but never knew how to bring it up to a doctor, but I think I’m going to push the issue since I have an appointment coming up soon. 

Fatherhood is indeed awesome! I honestly never wanted to be a parent, but now that I’m in it, it’s amazing. Unfortunately, something that really sticks in my mind is when we went to the doctor and his mother made a comment about his potential autism being “her fault” and her not specifying. That statement really really scares me because my mind immediately jumped to her being guilty about something. But until court is over and a custody schedule is made, I’m too nervous to say anything just yet.

Thank you so much again for responding. This has helped ease a gnawing monster of anxiety in the back of my mind. It’s difficult for me to ask for help and advice (that quiz may have gave an answer why) so this has been a huge step in my life.

I would like to add, he /was/ attending a speech therapy program from an “early intervention” group, but his mother has since pulled him from the program because there is a problem with lice in the daycare the program was at. 

His “frustration” of not speaking may have been misspoken of me now that I think about it. When I ask him questions, it’s usually ignored but sometimes he will make a face that to me implies he is thinking of an answer but cannot get it out. I also noticed his ability to make eye contact and things are the most observed right after he wakes up from a nap, but that is also because there is no other stimuli in the room besides the calming music I play in the background for his naps. When he does make eye contact, it’s directly to the eyes and I always make sure when it happens I smile, when he doesn’t make eye contact he just seems like he’s looking at everything. Sometimes if I can get him to play peek-a-boo his eye contact is more consistent because it’s making him laugh hysterically. I will make sure that from now on eye contact is on his terms, I don’t want my little man to be uncomfortable around me! 

He also does not like to sit still for the most part. Sometimes he does, but he definitely is a fan of the zoomies. I do know autism is genetic and my brother and I have often talked about the idea of both of us being mildly autistic but never really knew how to bring up to our doctors and having them take it seriously. Oddly enough, our father was an engineer for Progresso way back in the day (late 80’s to early 2000’s) before his passing. He got that job with nothing more than the most basic GED competing against people with masters degrees; however, I know pretty much nothing about him as he passed when I was 15 and him and I never really communicated together. My mom is also pretty unsure of any health problems and/or autism related issues with him. 

I’ve never really seen him get upset at anything concerning loud noises, too many people, nothing of that sort. He will sometimes have a mini melt down if you tell him no to something, but he’s a really easy going kid. Touching doesn’t seem to bother him, he likes to be picked up and held and will actively try to cover me with a blanket to nap with him when it’s his nap time. 

The other side to this coin is his mother. There was 2.5 years where I will never know what happened. I don’t want to put dirty laundry on the internet, but there is a lot of concerns in that area that make me wonder. If you and I were having a face to face conversation I would tell you about them, but that is something I’m not entirely comfortable putting out there. 

It’s hard for me to express everything because I’m really trying to live in the moment when I have time with him and make up for lost time while simultaneously learning to be a father, but I seriously cannot express enough gratitude for you right now. Thank you SO SO SO SO much.

&amp;#x200B;

2.Nothing helps for my headaches in the long term. Painkillers work,but only for a moment(i am a medical student,i tried all those i could find without serious risks of addiction/impairment of judgement.Classic nsaids still work best for me,and even those i only take sparringly.Painkillers aint candy). For the social part i have litterally exercised situations before a mirror. Visualising conflicts before they happen really helps me to resolve them(without either backing down nor threatening to pull a rear naked choke on the other guy. Peace can be found in balance and compromise,so they say. It's not easy to find when you have autism and someone starts to insult you,and your self control can get overwhelmed when the insults become personnal).

3.Ask to the person what you can do to help them. If they don't want your help on something(even if you as a professional think it can help them) then ask them why. Sometimes we are ashamed to ask for help or to receive it. Sometimes we are scarred that their is a hidden agenda to the help people t to give you(most of us have been the social outcast who received a spontaneous act of kindness only for the person who did it to use it as leverage to get ten times more hep out of you.We are afraid of again becoming victim to such a manipulation tactic.).If they still don't want help after explanations then don't push it but tell them your door is open. Many of us regret refusing help when stuff becomes harder for us.

4.DONT EVER TELL ME MY AUTISM IS A GIFT(FROM GOD OR SOMETHING ELSE). Some of us are either glad they have autism or are neutral towards it.Good for them. I am (and most of the people with autism i have met) are not. It is not because i am relatively sucessfull that i am glad i have autism. It made everything a thousand times harder. I lost several girlfriends partly because i didn't always see problems coming in our relationship. My headaches almost costed me a year of study. I have had a miserable and relatively lonely youth compared to neurotypical siblings and cousins.  Many therapists try to cheer me up with this line,but it is a very poor choice of words when someone is venting about their autism-related problems(like i know that my difference can make me an asset to a medical team, that  doesn't mean others will see it that way(or even want me on the team). Be as neutral about autism as possible until you know confidently how the person with autism thinks about their diagnosis(and autism in general).

Also don't underestimate the problems of the highest-functioning individuals among us. Our problems might be subtler,but generally still present(like having a hard time to find a GF/BF/other-gender partner for those of us who fancy that,or difficulty having our competency and hard work rewarded because others consistently  steal a part of the credit of our work.Poor conflict management is also a frequent problem,for example,as is standing up to abuse).

Don't dismiss those problems when someone finds a way to talk to you. Talking about a minor problem first to see if listen without judging seems to be a common tactic of people with autism before they ""spill the beans""(this comes from my experience in ER rooms,so it might be a bit irrelevant in you field of work,take it with a pinch of salt). If you tell them to chalk it up/that the little thing that seems to bother them immensely is not important then you are indirectly sending the signal that you can't be trusted.Don't do this.Also some of us will genuinely be more distraught about the destruction of their stim toy or the fact that the paramedic was rude than they are about their heavily bleeding forearm with a severed radial artery  .Hyperfocus can even override survival instincts with some of us . Never dismiss those little things

i hope your kid has friends who dont mind that theyre different and needs more help than other people and i hope you treat them good because the worst thing in the world is knowing how frustrated and angry and resentful your parent is to you over something you have no control of.

your kid life already is on hard mode they dont need attachment issues and childhood trauma on top of it, speaking from experience here. some neurotypical parents of autistic kids get vitriol because WE are all autistic kids of neurotypical parents, and i promise you our anger didnt come from thin air. we feel this way towards some of you for good reason, and we are scared for some of your kids.

 Just like we sometimes get the ""you don't look autistic"" because of people only being aware of classic autism they get it because more people now know someone close to them that is less severe because it's being recognized more, it seems that the more severe is actually becoming the lesser know autism now.

 My sister's is constantly under stress making sure he's safe and it's honestly really hard for her she has hyperviglence and constant anxiety because it only takes one second and he's found his way outside.

My guess is this mom just gives her kid a tablet and let's him browse the kid YouTube app, which actually limits what kids can watch and who they can watch. FGTeev is in a small list in the menu of youtubers that the app allows them to watch (there aren't many. I checked.) there's also a crazy ton of super cool music videos for fnaf and other games (that's about all we listen to in the car anymore lol).

In the case of your mosque visit, the fact that your parents said they are worried about you being radicalised during the visit (it's no different to visiting a church or a gurdwara or a temple for example) suggests to me that they were partially motivated by their own prejudices against Muslims and Islam. 

Of course, I haven't met your parents, so I don't know personally if it would be wise to call them out on this directly. If they aren't naturally open-minded people, then calling them out is probably not going to be a good idea as they might retaliate with a strengthening of their control and restrictions placed on you. But generally speaking, observations about your parents such as this one (regarding a personal prejudice that they harbour), and, in a sense, 'profiling' your parents, might be helpful when it comes to predicting what could provoke positive and negative responses from them, before incidents occur. Also, having a mental 'profile' of your parents stored in your head will hopefully give you some talking prompts, including specific examples of past incidents, which can help you to communicate to others the severity and details of the problems associated with living with your parents: why they choose certain methods to implement so that they can control you/watch over you; why they get angry at one thing specifically, but not other similar things etc.

It frustrated me that people thought there was something wrong with me so much that i began to think it too and i began to try to change myself to be accepted. Then I started having mental breakdowns and panic attacks and doing drugs and I was homeless for a year. I never really considered autism because i didn't know what it was, then one day I had the bright idea to look it up and I watched some videos and I found myself in tears because of how much I saw myself in them. I continued watching more and more videos and took an online quiz and by that point I was convinced I had autism. I had been seeing a therapist for about 8 months not really making any progress and I asked her about how to get a diagnosis thanks to the recommendation of some videos I watched. She put a referral in for me to the wrong doctor initially (and i'm still trying to figure the bill out for that one) but eventually she referred me to a clinic that works with adults with autism so I could get a diagnosis. I was on their wait list for almost a year but I finally got diagnosed about a month ago and it was SO RELIEVING. My partner finally believed me about a lot of things I struggle with and he is beginning to understand more about what I go through. I *immediately* told my dad so now i'm assuming my whole family knows (because his wife loves to gossip), with the exception of my mom (I am n/c with her). I was also diagnosed with some comorbid things like general anxiety, major depression and PTSD so i'm currently in the process of getting help from the county to get proper therapy and rehab and resources for everything. I really feel like i'm finally on the right path and i'm in the process of re-learning how to truly be myself and be confident in myself and enjoy things I enjoy without worrying about what other people think and trying not to mask my entire personality anymore.

 I do have some very fixed preferences for food, like carrots when they are hard make me want to die, so does zuchini. I am terrible socially and always leave the parties early. Even when surrounded by friends, if there are more than a couple of people, I feel overwhelmed and my mood slowly goes down, till I can't bring myself to speak at all. Every time my mother changes her recipes even a little bit, I am the only one who picks up on it and it bothers me enough that I can't eat it. My classroom has this weird smell, that most people don't even notice, but it constantly makes me nauseated and I can never eat there. I didn't notice this before, but I need to constantly move, usually I just doodle so it seems normal, because I love drawing, but I often tap my feet, scratch my hands, fidget with them, play with my hair or do something, usually unnoticeable but annoying to other people. Talking to people is very exhausting in groups, but I can talk for hour if it's a one one call with my friends. There s so much more, that makes me weird. I might be just overreacting and overthinking, but there are enough things to make me consider the possibility, that I might be on the spectrum, even if it is very mild.",,1601632564,,{},g7dxe5g,False,t3_j35jeh,False,True,t1_g7dwanm,/r/autism/comments/j35jeh/finally_got_a_diagnosis/g7dxe5g/,1601632592,1,True,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,0,[],,,,

1. As a young child I was very bossy when in groups I found it really difficult to communicate and play with the other children I would always try to overpower my peers and take control so it was in my order and the way I wanted it. 

2. I’ve always been incredibly sensitive to noise , smells , lights and touch etc even now at 14 this still majorly effects my day to day life. I would always have trouble at places like cinemas or large open spaces with tightly packed crowds I couldn’t go on the tube or on the train regularly and I still struggle in general with sensory issues which are a big part of ASD and the spectrum. 

3. I have and always had a very restricted plain diet that is “safe” for me. Following on from point 2 it’s to do with sensory issues like textures and smells but it’s also to do with routine I have an incredibly structured rigid diet that hasn’t changed since I was around 2-3. 

4. Strict routine and order , I’ve always need to have things planned and ordered in a manner that I see fit if my routine or order is disrupted or changed I become incredibly stressed and it can lead to a meltdown. This can range from really big to really small things like my plug sockets being moved or my time schedule being changed. 

5. I’m unable to cope with change. Change in any sort is incredibly overwhelming and again often lead to meltdowns it’s one of the things that I still struggle to cope with and can affect me daily and often does. 

6. I cannot socialise as well as my peers. Even now I still do not interact with many people or have many friends I come across as very reserved and quiet and tend not to join in the “fun” as it has been described to me. I have 1 friend and school and when I’m at home I am in my own company so I do not socialise very well.  

These are just a few of the main traits I can remember of the top of my head this is not all of it there are other pretty key traits / issues but I would be here for many hours and I feel like you could probably do a great job at re-searching the rest. Things like humour, stims, special interests etc etc are again all very key parts but I felt as if you could get a wider insight looking these up I hope I’ve helped even if a little , if you are in need of any more information I would be happy to help so you can just drop me a message anytime. Please do not make a diagnosis or anything of that sort based on the information I have given you if you suspect that you may have ASD or fall somewhere on the spectrum please talk to someone professional and do some additional in depth research into how broad the spectrum is and just how many traits there are. 

Thank you for listening (๑˃̵ᴗ˂̵).

I also found it quite frustrating to see someone trying to coin a brand new term ""aspienwoman"" when it's perfectly reasonable to just be a woman who is autistic/has Asperger's. It feels like it's responding to the gendering of the autism/Asperger's diagnosis by trying to create a second one of ""aspienwoman"" for women and women presenting folks instead of just trying to push for autism and Asperger's traits to be considered for all genders. It also rubbed me the wrong way that the article constantly referred to ""females"" on the spectrum instead of women, and that it continually needed to state that this is an anecdotal unproven list while being so frequently general that it makes it clear why there had to be a disclaimer about false positives.

Please note this is said by someone who is between cis woman and agender. 

I will also acknowledge that there are many items which are useful if you're struggling to project the classic symptom lists onto your own behaviour, such as pointing out that hair twirling can be a stim or that being quiet and withdrawn while clearly a trait is often overlooked in girls as shyness.

We're still seeing far less tics and stimming, and she's physically calm for the first time since before kindergarten. You know, the constant micro movements and visible tension in the neck and shoulders has stopped, and her hands are still. 
That's why this is killing me. This summer has been the worst for traumatic events, but the best for her demeanor, confidence, security, and calm.

Then for my birthday I got my septum pierced.

Three days later I woke up and realised I'd been feeling really good for a few days. And then it hit me. My nausea was gone.

So after much research here is the data I've gathered.

1) getting your septum pierced kills off a slew of nose hairs. Specifically the ones near the tip of your nose. Apparently that decreases smell sensitivity.

2) there is a nerve in your nose that is involved with nausea. People will actually get acupuncture on it to help deal with their nausea? Well apparently getting your septum pierced can do the same thing?

[],,imjustfinethankx,,,[],,,,text,t2_7omqnjpb,False,False,[],"Try not to get caught up in the stereotypes. And be careful with who you tell about this book, especially if they're on the spectrum. A lot of autistics look down upon non-autistic writers writing autistic characters, but honestly I think we need the positive media.

A bit of a crash course on stimming, sensory overload, and meltdowns: non of them are specific to autism! However, the way they are expressed varies. For example, someone with ADHD might have a meltdown that looks like extreme hyperactivity and aggression, while a person with autism might hyperventilate, stim, and curl up in a ball. 

Just a disclaimer: meltdowns vary to person to person, too. However, they're pretty easy to write once you map out what that character's autism really is.

Now, onto stimming. Interestingly enough, everyone stims! Have you ever bounced your leg or tapped your fingers because you were bored or anxious? That's stimming. A lot of people think stims are a way of expressing anxiety and distress, but in reality, it either feels good to do or expresses any range of emotion because autistic people struggle to recognize emotions.

Sensory overload and meltdowns are two different things, however sensory overload can lead to a meltdown. Sensory overload is pretty self explanatory, too; things are too loud, too bright, too fast, and your brain doesn't know how to process it all, so it presses the emergency brake. You stop thinking about anything else other than how loud that fan is or how bright that lamp is.

On to speech; a lot of autistic people have selective mutism or speech impediments. A lot of autistics also like to repeat certain words or sounds (called echolalia). A lot of autistic children (and some adults) will use quotes from movies, cartoons, or tv shows to communicate. 

The key to writing autistic characters is keeping them different. I'd suggest making them almost polar opposites, since that can help to drive the point across that autistics aren't all the same. 

Thanks for not just writing an autistic character in the way you a neurotypical sees us. A lot of writers do that, and it's frustrating.

I don't know how they do it, but they fly when talking, while I have to think every word I say a couple times to make sure I'm communicating exactly what I mean.

That's why I usually don't even talk when in a conversation with two or more people. Unless they ask me something, but most of the time they interrupt me anyway so I'm out again.

Some things I learned:

- The one who speaks the loudest is the one they are gonna pay the most attention to. Doesn't matter if they are just talking dumb stuff. This makes them also the more powerful person in the group.

- They don't seem to care if the topic of the conversation shifts and someone was still waiting their turn to comment something. This person should have spoken louder.

- Everyone is waiting for their turn to speak and be noticed, so if you leave a blank space or make a pause they are gonna interrupt you.

- If you are in a group conversation and someone asks you something about you, it's pretty likely that the only person that cares about the answer is the one who asked (although sometimes they ask just out of courtesy). Pretty often someone asks me about some aspect of my life and immediately interrupts talking about something else like they forgot they asked.

- Don't mind it that much. What you know and like is too valuable to waste time speaking to people that is not gonna listen. If you wanna say something don't think it through too much, just say the first thing that comes to mind, they are not gonna remember if you make a mistake, or care if you didn't deliver your message exactly as you meant it. Else just listen and see what you can learn, both from the topic and from the way people communicate.

Ebay is great for sports equipment because a lot of people want the newest shiniest fanciest equipment all the time; you can get stuff that's been little used for really cheap.

Agree shoes are probably the only thing you need to hike and depends on the terrain whether they need to cost much. I have cheap trail runners (they were £20?

I ran from therapist to therapist from the age of 12 until I was 19... I hated every second of it. They gave me all sort of neuroleptica, anti-depressants, and more. Autism wasn't even mentioned once.


It was only when I was 21, that I was playing video games with my little brother, and his friend (both ~17y/o at that point) who asked me if I'm on the spectrum (he was genuinely curious, not rude or anything). I laughed it off at first, because I had this stereotypical image of autism in my mind. Nonetheless, I looked it up, and stumbled upon an article about autism in women. Then it clicked. Like everything fell into place!


I'll be honest: I can't help but feel bitter! I had around 10 psychiatrists in my life, and none of them could agree on what was 'wrong' with me. I got bullied a lot, and my parents neglected me, so I literally had to learn everything on my own. It was hard, and if I would have been diagnosed earlier, it would have saved me from a lot of struggle!


Yes, I got diagnosed now, but I have to confess: I don't tell anyone anymore. Initially I tried, but whenever I brought it up people started to walk on eggshells around me. They talk slower, and act as if I'm not all there.

Neurotypicals still often view autism as a disability, and I don't want this label on me (I hope this doesn't sound rude).
It's just that I live on my own, I work on my own, I do everything else on my own, so considering me disabled is just plain wrong.

Another confession: I didn't tell any of my relatives either. They would understand it just fine I guess, but I'm sick of bringing up stuff from my past. I tried soooo long to get away from everything and have a normal life, I'm not looking back now.

Even with different behaviour that is caused by autism. Autism is the reason. Not the excuse. 

It is up to the person, or their family or carers to ensure they can handle change. Or if they can’t that someone can take control so no one else is hurt. 

If autism was a factor in this it would probably be she struggles when routines change. And every day she comes and orders the same thing and never has to wait etc... then one day it’s different. That would be a normal upset for an autistic person that struggles with routine change. However, it wouldn’t excuse anything they did to hurt others. Whether raising their voice, throwing things, hurting someone, etc...

I was kicked out of multiple schools because of my meltdowns and perceived 'bad behaviour'. Now there are specialist schools specifically for people on the spectrum so that they can have a fair shot at an education. 

This generation of people on the spectrum have so many more opportunities for help and support, and even laws that provide protection from discrimination and abuse. 

People who use discriminatory language don't speak for the majority anymore. Those kind of people will always be there in life, but they're not tolerated like they were back when people didn't know any better.

This is the major problem I see: most people practicing ABA have very little understanding of autism. The RBT license requires a high school diploma and 40 hours of coursework. There is absolutely no way anyone could learn all they need to know in that time. I've spoken to ABA therapists who had no idea the field was controversial. I talked to one RBT who had never heard that some autistic people go to college. They have no incentive to go beyond that 40 hours.

The education BCBAs get is at least closer to what they need. I won't call it perfect, but at the very least they're investing a lot more time into learning about autism.

Whenever I have been in the dating game, I have had to force myself to act like I knew what I was doing (I didn't and I don't) and did not fear rejection (I did and I do). Those factors make it very difficult for people like me (thus possibly him) to act on anything less than an open invitation.

I can, obviously, not guarantee that he is anything like me, but my only suggestion is to cut out any subtelty and more or less lay your feelings open to him, as daunting as that can be. I know you will feel vulnerable (oh, have I been there!) and a rejection would be crushing, but I see no other possibility, apart from giving up on him.

Also, do remember that many of us (autistic people) have serious problems showing our feelings and will flaunt our utter lack of understanding of proper social interactions and relationships in a situation like this.

From my experience with myself and other autistic people, you can expect one of four reactions: He will tell you he is not interested (which could possibly make him withdraw from you); he will intellectualise it and start talking about it without any show of emotion (dangerous that emotion!); he will more or less ignore it (“if I ignore it, it hasn't happened and I do not need to take it into consideration thus not upsetting my mental equilibrium”); or he will accept it (and possibly be much too “clingy” or even demanding, again due to social ineptitude and lacking knowledge of the rules of the “dating game”).

What you get is what is going on now. If I will not immediately hop on the transgender bandwagon and their accusatory, hysterical and downright nasty demands on society, I will be labeled negatively, attacked, moderated. And you can see that happening in this very threat. Why am I being downmodded while we have a conversation? People are hard at work from their pathetic *group think echo chamber* to ban dissent.

I  pity such people because they refuse to use their brain and consciousness as nature intended and are prone so social indoctrination and bigotry.

Most people I find to be hypocritical and under the guise of double think and other logical fallacies. And people these days create filter bubbles, by re-defining established meanings of words and terms to suit their owns elfish ideological needs. Internet enables such behavior. This is why wikipedia is apparently a psychotic mess of behind the scenes unknown editors with personal beefs against what they deem is unscientific. Wikipedia is not a true encyclopedia.

No one ever came out to me when I mentioned it to declare they were the one clicking on the down arrow. It is intellectual and ideological cowardice.

It is the classic little baby syndrome in people who become demanding of the greater populace when something challenges their filter bubble. 

But I do nothing else but challenge paradigms, assumptions and other unexamined patterns of behavior. And I see how cowardly the autistic community acts, how demanding of rights, same with lettermix people, who infect now all of society by emotionally blackmailing anyone who does not agree with their petty demands on respect and equality.

We now must face actors and actresses who, in the media, cowardly apologize for even desiring or considering playing a transgender while not being one.

The stupidity is enormous! What does one not understand about the concept of acting? As an actor you take on the role of another person that by the very act of acting, you are not. And as an actor you research the role to give as best a representation possible. 

That means I will sue Clint Eastwood for not really being a cowboy in many of these films, or a cop for that matter. 

But why should I sue? Maybe Texas ranchers should, because somehow they are not being represented by one of their own social group.

Society exists of very many social groups, that are minorities by default, based on health issues.And often the percentages are small, 1%, 3,5% for ADHD e.g. and depending on what research you read/believe , these numbers often vary. We have schizophrenics, ADHD, ASD, Parkinson, OCD and related issues, the list is long. 

And so according to you I must go out of my way to do justice to each and every one of them, even though behaviorally I must act differently to each as to not insult them somehow. Which means I need to mask.

Which is rather silly being an autie, who gets told I shouldn't have to mask because all the rest ought to respect who I am and my public displays of idiosyncrasies like flapping and so on must be allowed, or even encouraged,  meanwhile not being registered and commented on negatively but dealt with in a positive and helpful manner while not making it an autistic reality because somehow that is insulting.

But we cannot study all these myriad groups of impairments around labels from the DSM. And so to conclude, we cannot demand anything. We must embrace and endorse different opinions being a possibility, that they may interject on our filter bubble and be more open and forgiving in situations where our needs are not immediate met and recognized.

This is what living on Earth means, to respect freedom of speech, of thought, of opinion. And those that silence us should be mocked openly and publicly for their pettiness and stifling of debate against democratic values and their long toes, that they on purpose put underfeet of another, just so that they can feel justified in crying out about some imagine injustice.

So no. I am not gonna go out of my way to appease every group lest I insult them. They too should grow thick skin because it cuts both ways. I will not demand extra respect from 95% of the population including other impaired groups of people and hope they do the same thing, to respect me.

And I refuse to be insulted by ignorance of my condition because I already know I have disabilities and do not shy or look away from them out of a need not to be confronted by these impairments.

Inclusiveness means nothing if it doesn't mean the realization that others are indeed different and that we cannot always either understand or comply with special needs. You want to include someone, cut off their long toes first. Because with long toes you can never do right by them and that is how the autistic community largely behaves, as well as the lettermix people.

I've had a good amount of girls go after me but I get spooked and lose interest. As a guy, I need to feel like I won the girl over with my love or 50/50 thing where we might have been friends prior to falling in love.

As someone diagnosed with Autism as an adult, that is probably the most autistic thing you could do. Writing a paper citing everything you believe a diagnosis would correlate with yourself is a super big sign to me. 

As for tips, your psychiatrist may want to speak to people who knew you when you were younger. When you were younger, it was probably more apparent because you hadn't learned all of your coping mechanisms or masking strategies yet. So get some phone numbers or emails and let them know what's going on and that they might be contacted. I used my mom and my brother as references.

Not every criteria may apply to you and that's ok. Just because you have the flu, doesn't mean you have every symptom from WebMD. 

What else, um

Let your psychiatrist know that you realize it's not necessarily a good thing to self diagnose but that this has been on your mind for a while and you need it seriously considered. Please emphasize the NEED IT SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED part. You don't just want it, you have a firm need. This cannot be brushed aside, it must be seriously considered. 

If that is difficult to say out loud to someone, feel free to put that in your paper or into an email. 

I put it in an email.

If your psychiatrist isn't sure, maybe ask if there is someone who has more experience with people who have Asperger's or Autism that they can speak to or that you can see.

That was something my friend's psychiatrist suggested because she honestly wasn't sure if she could accurately diagnose.

They go to Kaiser so they will sometimes do a consultation session where they send you to a different psychiatrist who works in that department. 

If you need a person in there with you to be an advocate for you or make you feel more comfortable, take them. Sometimes you need that.

Psychotherapy: You will need a yellow slip from a psychiatrist, with this you can call psychotherapists and find one that is paid by Krankenkasse (sorry I'm not feeling well and can't get the right words out); but if you're a german speaker and want more info on this (I've been going to therapy for almost my whole life) let me know

Here you can find therapists in Austria:

https://psychotherapie-wlp.at/informationen/psychotherapeutinnen-suche

ETA: I worded it a bit wrong. The yellow slip is needed if you want it paid by Krankenkasse, those that are Wahlärzte don't need that and usually you get an appointment very fast (because one has to pay every hour themself), which is (or was), depending on the therapist, in the range of 60€ up to 100€.

[],,Ludark,,,[],,,,text,t2_3ayxpj,False,False,[],"**The short version(with no explanation):** is over 5 years.

**The longer version:** I was first diagnosed with Aspergers when I was 13, the only reason I even got diagnosed was done due to heavy urging from my school. As my parents refused to acknowledge anything with me and I personally didn't see any problems with myself either at the time.

As a result I never really took the proces of getting diagnosed seriously and since my parents continued to be dismissive as well. I just stayed in complete denial mode for the next 5 years or so, though I will admit the diagnosis was in the back of my mind during this time.

Eventually life caught up to me and I started running into actual issues(which I don't really want to discuss here) and to receive any sort of benefits/help, I needed some diagnosis and since I wasn't really happy about how my first diagnosis went(in large part because I didn't take it seriously). I decided to get diagnosed once again, to finally settle my doubts.

My second diagnosis ended up being PDD-NOS, which while different from Aspergers, is still on the spectrum. So at that point there no longer was a point in denying things and I gradually came to terms with the fact that I am on the spectrum.

As for **tips:**

Honestly there is no point in denying your diagnosis, it's part of you whether you like it or not. However it needs to be noted that it also changes nothing about who you are. Another thing is that it's only part of you, not all of you, it will not define who you are as a person unless you let it do so. Lastly denying things may actually cause more problems down the line since it might prevent you from seeking help when you need it.",,1604525261,,{},gb5qtuu,False,t3_jo4r6k,False,True,t3_jo4r6k,/r/autism/comments/jo4r6k/how_long_did_it_take_before_you_truly_accepted/gb5qtuu/,1604531032,1,True,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,0,[],,,,

I've never been good or even competent at all of the required job tasks and it's rare that anyone I work with likes me. But there are always some job tasks that I'm extremely good at. Especially working with systems and machines. I wish I could do something extremely specialized with little human contact, but I have no idea how to get a job like that.

We jokingly refer to it as inundation inertia because it builds up when he feels overwhelmed and then quite often by the time he feels less overwhelmed there is so much to do that he doesn't know where to start.

In terms of tidying maybe set yourself a generous amount of time to declutter the biggest room in your house (say two weeks for fairly moderate clutter), dusting and cleaning as you go, then try and ""beat your time"" for each subsequent room and keep all rooms free of clutter while you do this part.

Once your house is tidy you might find that a routine helps i.e. on Mondays clean the whole kitchen (not just cleaning up the area / equipment used to cook or eat but cleaning the floor, wiping down surfaces and cabinet fronts etc) 
on Tuesdays vacuum / sweep the whole house
So on and so on until all the cleaning is rota'd. I would try to leave weekends free of jobs that are crucial to cleaning the house so that you can have a social life without trying to juggle cleaning because if you don't enjoy cleaning then you will always choose to go out and things will build up again. Maybe put mowing the lawn or weeding the garden as weekend jobs?

Like, my SO, I felt nothing for her until I met her, had dates with her, and started getting really intimate with her. I knew she was cool and I liked her, but romantic attraction? nah. Heck, I don't think we had an emotional connection till after at least a month of dating. We were dating because we found ourselves compatible enough to try, and TO forge an emotional connection. 

And she's very NT. She does find me quite odd, but we work quite well, because she makes me feel good as a person, improves my life and emotions, and is there to tell me what is actually NT and what is definitely ND. I provide different perspectives and things for her, solve her random problems, and can tank a lot of things that would wear her down, as I'm built differently. Our love works, because we are different. 

Dating is getting to know a person to see if they're compatible with you and your life, and learning if you like them or not. You shouldn't wait until you like someone to date them, or worry about emotional connections. I've dated people I know I couldn't have dated long term, but I only found out because I went on those dates, and I was attached beforehand. I've had other people that I didn't think I'd really like, but enjoyed getting to know. 

Don't wait for some emotional something or other. If you have one beforehand, great, but it's not the end all be all for meeting someone. Sorry if this comes across as harsh, I really don't mean to offend or call you out, I just hope I can provide some advice from further down the line.

Here's the thing, 95% of the time, you shouldn't be friends with the person if you want to date them. Why? friends are awesome, but they very much have different ideas of who they want to date. Like, ok you have this awesome lady friend, but her ideal partner is very much different from what she thinks of you. Trying to make her like you romantically very easily could torpedo the friendship, and wouldn't get you anywhere. 

Instead, meet awesome women to date, Neurotypical, or Neurodiverse. My partner is very much NOT Neurodiverse, but it doesn't impact our relationship at all. She just knows I have specific triggers and things, and I don't always get certain things.  At the same time, I can hyperfixate on random problems that she would have trouble with. 

As for how to meet women? Well, dating apps, through friends, in bars (when covid dies) in classes. You can basically ask anyone on a coffee date, and see where it goes. A formal date is a bad idea unless both of you are super into formal dates. 

As for connections? They're found randomly, and made randomly. Sometimes you meet someone, get to know them, and it goes nowhere. Sometimes you meet someone ad their amazing. But you don't know until you meet them and talk to them a bit.

So don't limit yourself, and I really hope it goes well for you.",,1603104394,,{},g9b881c,False,t3_jdul5j,False,True,t3_jdul5j,/r/autism/comments/jdul5j/how_do_i_find_autistic_girls_my_age_to_talk_to/g9b881c/,1603104405,1,True,False,autism,t5_2qhs6,0,[],,,,

It really is :D

I've learned to translate the more technical stuff to laymans terms because of my work (I have to interact with clients). As a bonus it made it easier for me to share my excitement about my interests. 

Luckily, and mostly because of the above, I do have a few people I can share some stuff with.

CompTIA A+ seems like a proper certificate! It's really nice that you can roll into IT that way. The course I'm doing is 'just' a Udemy course suggested to me by another redditor. I do get some sort of certificate though.

Regarding a VPN. I have an interesting setup, if I say so myself. I have WireGuard running and it's my preferred VPN. But, in case a network blocks all but the standard ports, I also have OpenVPN running on port 443. But once I've hopped onto my home network, the 443 port on the server is used to run nginx (reverse proxy with HTTPS to access all my services). So the port forwarding is like this:

443 (external/router) -&gt;  1194 (server). 1194 (server) -&gt; 443 (server, but within the Docker network).

I haven't played with pfSense (yet). My ISP combi is in bridge mode and connects to a Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X. A Ubiquiti Unifi AP AC Pro is connected to that. So far the EdgeRouter has been able to do everything I ask of it. I even use it to redirect stray (hardcoded) DNS queries to my Pi-hole. The response is then masked as if it is coming from the DNS server that was hardcoded.

I could easily try pfSense out though, since my motherboard has two NICs.

I’m right now try to pass the campTIA A+ certification stuff so I can be in IT. I guess a bout a year ago the technology world just exploded for me and I’ve never looked back. One of the goals I’m really hoping for is getting a home server so I can run lots of shares VPN and some Minecraft servers ( also love doing that for my friends.) also this home server will be coming from a friend, he’s in IT and he found me a server that I can have. Yay! Anyways, because that server is already built I wanted to get another just for an excuse to build a computer. Lol. That computer will be an off site backup for my home computer for a while, then come back to my home where it will probably be a plex server. 

Same!! I never stop talking about my interests, but I don’t have many people in my life that will understand and be interested when I’m telling them about an interest. So this is really fun.

I wasn't diagnosed with anything but epilepsy and coordination problems when I was younger but by the time high school hit, I knew that I wasn't fine. I labelled myself instead as a ""f**k up"". I went along with that label only for quite a while and built on the self hate that came with it with every failure throughout my life.



I can't work for someone else and I don't think not having that option is fine but I'm looking for other solutions instead of finding a cure for myself.




It's not a lack of awareness. A lot of people don't want to mess with their neurological make up to the extent that a cure would. That doesn't mean they don't want to treat their symptoms at all. Some want therapy, some want medication, some want alternative treatments like cbd, some design their lives to work with their brain not against it, some use a combo and some don't feel a need for any of this. But a cure, ie making them not autistic anymore, is a friggin big change to make to an individual. If you want a cure, you are welcome to want that but you can't just say ""I want it so the reason others don't is a lack of awareness"" because it isn't that simple. 



People's reasoning doesn't really matter though. What was important was simply the fact that you can't assume all level 3 people want or need a cure.

[],,AberrantDynamic,,,[],,,,text,t2_2yxmtbde,False,False,[],"I used to feel as if I had people that I could communicate with on a deeper level, what would always end up happening is that I would find their walls. Not their emotional walls but literally I would run into a wall where their depth would cease. I would become beached having sped out of their depth or, it felt, suddenly hit the ground after free falling with them into conversation. 

When you say your biggest interests is humans you take the words from my mouth, I find each person is a story of so many interesting details. They are like a town you can travel forever and always find new details or areas you’ve never been. As far as real conversation, I feel like when I bring up topics that really probe peoples thoughts or ideas they shut off. It seems to me that I am asking questions that they have never even asked themselves, I have also noticed that there is another behavior entirely. It is an intentional avoidance at thinking about things, they know that if they think about things that it will lead them down a trail of thinking about everything. It is hard for me to imagine that people just shut off, I think that everyone has that intensely loving and passionately interested portion of their humanity but I think some people murder it or the world does. You mentioned people being disinterested in you, I have never felt bad about it. I could never bring myself to blame someone for making a mistake, they don’t know ‘you’. They don’t know the wonderful creations that all people are, they don’t know the scars that we all share from different battles, people are closed off and I don’t blame them. I don’t take it personally anymore. If they knew me for who I really was, if they could see the world with open eyes for just a moment, we would be the best of friends. 

I would say that I have pulled away from people but the tragic thing is…I’ve never had anyone. I’ve been in relationships, the longest almost a decade, I had a mother and a brother, I’ve had many friends…but I’ve never actually had anyone who sat down in front of me and said the simplest of things. 

“Tell me about your life.”

“I really want to know how you are doing.”

“What are you passionate about? What do you dream about?”

Most people can’t even think about their own situations so I don’t feel bad that they cannot think of others, I know that I am apart from this world somehow. I am made to feel like an outsider but I feel as if I am just thankful to be a temporary visitor. Indulging in unsocial activities? I’ve spent my life hiding away with escapism. Videogames, being in the woods, day dreaming about a better life and a better world…I’ve spent more time out of my body than in it. I don’t think it’s wasted time but I know I could be doing more. More for myself, for others, for the problems we all face. I contend with myself constantly in a battle questioning reality, I am sane as far as I can determine, but I often question or feel as if I am supposed to be doing something great. I feel as if I was made to do something different but I worry that this thing or time will never come and I will reflect on my deathbed of wasted time that could have been spent traveling or otherwise enjoying the world and its beauty.

I think about the universe placing me right here, right now…having me run into you. Two people, strangers, like two bodies in physics meeting and interacting, destined to bounce from one another eventually into the trajectories that are the rest of their lives. That’s all of our encounters in life, we waste so much time being invested in work or worry when we should be allowed to spend a life living. Of caring. Of being instead of wanting. Fearing death is like fearing life, the mechanics that brought me here are the same ones that will take me away, I trust in the nature of the process and that by the existence of life being so right and so figured out that death must also be just as right and just as figured out. Death exists and I trust in its existence as being nature and good.

Impulse control is interesting. I too have achieved great things from impulse but more often I find that what other people call impulse is simply behavior not to their liking. The birds sing, it is their nature. I gravitate and desire towards things I enjoy. I don’t put myself in bad situations with my choices but I make choices to indulge often, or I did anyway, I have learned that there really isn’t any pleasure to be had from things. No item in the world brings me joy anymore, not in a sad way, but in a way where I understand that experiences are what matters. I just never get to share those experiences with others, those insights, those vacations from the drudge of life. I have been solo since the hatch and can’t remember ever having a partner in life who was ready for a journey. Apathy is rough. I still struggle. I’ve distanced myself from others and can’t really find the motivation to spend time with them anymore, I feel like they only spend time with me because I am their wizard or whatever. They don’t like me for me, they just like me because I talk about cool stuff, am interested in their lives, ask real questions that engage them or make them feel good, listen about their problems, and then disappear. 

There has to be more to life than doing this routine until I die.

I just figure this is how my mind works. I see young autistic people working labor like this and I wonder where are the women and how much is he paying these people for their labors.

Their job is literally to be on the front lines so the rest of us don't have to be.

I got one (SO expensive! $250-300 euro, 270-340 US dollar)) 

It is light and comfy. It can be used cordless or on bluetooth. You charge it in 2-3 hours with a cord and can use it for about 5. It really works. It just does not cancel talking people right near you. Or miauwing cats right near you. But the neighbours are cancelled, the TV is mostly cancelled, machine noises of household appliances are cancelled (vacuum cleaner is tuned down greatly). Traffic is far less.  Also your house mate will leave you alone more often when wearing  a headphone (bonus!)

You can use it with music or not. If not, I plug in a dummy plug (cut off an old headphone wire) when using it as silent noise cancellation. Otherwise it goes OFF after x minutes. 

I feel its totally worth it if you have a steady income. If not, you still got options. 

Maybe also look into earplugs? Earplugs are way cheaper. The ones for concerts and industrial work.  The downside is that fancy industrial plugs are made to not block voices and alarms and the concert ones do not block all frequencies so check that. 

Otoplastics (plugs molded in your ear) are not cheap ( 100 dollarish would be a fair price) but may be more comfy in the long run and work better. The over-ear earphones in the builders market cost maybe 20 dollars and could also help you. Buy one and see how it feels to wear over-ear phones? They usually press harder on you than the Sony.

BTW You can diminish sound by maximum of 25(A) dB with earplugs or earphones. The rest of the sound is received via vibration on your skull (a soft hat would help a tiny little).

Do you feel up to working on projects that will take you months to make substantial progress? Do you prefer projects that you can start and finish today?

Does a candidate field give you the expectation of making enough money to be happy?

A good choice in career gives you all of these things - a satisfying field, a visceral sense of accomplishment that comes with your work, projects that don't leave you feeling demotivated due to the scale of time you want to work in, being able to lead the life you want to live.

""I can be jealous of black men and not hate them."" I'm trying to get you to do the introspection you're avoiding here. It's a matter of fact that white male jealousy at the images they created of black people has been a MAJOR factor in the history of this country. And we all know this isn't some distant historical memory.

You seem not to realize that ""I have black friends"" or ""I have a wife""etc. are cliches which indicate a naive belief that racism is exclusively something cartoon villains and people who attack the Capitol do.

Here's a hint: racism and sexism are actually so pervasive in society that it takes ACTIVE EFFORT to break the habits. Members of oppressed groups struggle with internalized oppression, which they pick up from the surrounding cultural environment. When white men claim not to be racist or sexist, they're asserting that they're so far beyond the media's influence that they're immune to its messages even when those messages are flattering to them. We're out here struggling not to hate ourselves from the stuff, and you mean to tell me you're IMMUNE? That has no credibility. That's why you'll always struggle in these kinds of conversations.

Honest people admit that anti-racism is a lifelong project of personal growth. When people categorically say they don't have any problem with it, that simply means they DO have a problem with it, which is disturbing enough to avoid. As a social norm, a white person telling a black person that they're ""not racist"" will ALWAYS be met with skepticism, whether or not the person feels safe expressing that to you or not.

It's not just about whatever relatively non-objectionable things you're willing to admit to. It's that your rhetoric has tells of right wing sympathies, and you admit to FEELINGS shared with white supremacists. Take offense or not. I'm just explaining to you matter-of-factly why, as a black person, you do not seem trustworthy to me, and perhaps you can learn from this experience.

I've been the black friend of white people I knew were racist, too. Life is like that. You're too comfortable in your innocence. Most people are not going to be autistically blunt about race.

This can lead to erratic behavior and development issues and excess inflammation.

Inflammation can act as a blocker to development as well. Also this might be why so many parents think vaccinations caused their childs autism when really it might be it was the straw that broke the camels back so to speak with inflammation and gut issues or at least made it more obvious.

Well if you are seeing results with the diet thats actually really good news.  Only about 40% of kids respond to that.  Anecdotally about 80% respond to Nemechek combining them both you might have great results.  I think Nemechek is a very simplistic way of dealing with all the gut issues and can only take you so far.

I think see how the diet and Nemechek protocol goes.  Then if that doesn't work or progress stalls for a significant amount of time it might be worthwhile doing the testing for vitamin deficiencies etc.   I found this the other day and it seemed good.

Honestly I am just starting the biomedical path as my sons progress stalled for a few months but I actually think it was just a huge progress leap with ratty behaviour now and combined with the fact we went on holidays and christmas etc so a lot of junk etc was eaten.

However I have just started the testing phase to find out exactly what needs to happen so it is pretty new with me.  I always knew it was on the cards as Nemechek was a simple protocol dealing with a hugely complex issue and what the research out there suggests.

I am grateful you took the time to write this out for me to read.

See its not so hard, to find things to say. 

I think it may be that we are not actually that grateful. That's why its hard to say nice things...it would be fake.

Maybe the idea is better explained by ""How to fake being grateful?""
