My take away is that because life ends, that’s what makes the time meaningful and precious. There’s nothing special about an infinite existence, but because our time is limited, we find meaning in the time we have. That’s just me tho, and everyone reaches their own conclusions. 

1) i think most folks have some sort of existential crisis at some point where they question the meaning of life and what happens beyond life. It’s apart of being human, knowing our time will end but not knowing what the experience of it ending will be like. I think a lot of growth can happen during this period. Just be careful not to go down a nihilistic route with your thinking, as it’ll be detrimental to your mental health and quality of life. 
2) we all ponder it from time to time. again, part of being human.
3) most people reach a conclusion that gives them comfort and peace of mind. For some it’s religion, and after life. For others it’s spirituality, ex. for me, the circle of life is really important. My life is given to me by plants, by animals, etc. (life) i eat in order to sustain life. When I die, my corpse will decay and become soil in which plants (more life) will grow from, insects will eat my remains. These bugs and plants will sustain other life, etc. So in that way, my life is not truly over. My consciousness will cease to exist, but my life and energy will continue to flow into the universe in different forms, spread out. I think that’s beautiful. 

Ponder, find what you need to find. Just be sure to be gentle with yourself, and take care of yourself. It’s normal.

Let it go. Detach and try to overcome. And ultimately, make a goal to surpass your parents.

I come from a family with such a complex tragic backstory it could make drama writers reassess their skill. Death, family drama, abuse of every and all forms, it goes on. I'll spare you the details and leave it at I've experienced the death of two parents, four miscarriages, a sister, a favorite cousin, a close friend, my family is shattered and I only talk to 3 of my 8 siblings now and I expect my dad to die any day now. Been homeless twice, and just yesterday I got fired and then was served an eviction notice for damages to a unit I don't live in that weren't my fault.

So how do I manage? I accept the reality of a shitty situation and move forward as quickly as possible. When my mom died 3 years ago, I grieved for all of about an hour and just moved forward. I am used to death, it doesn't bother me anymore. Thats because I recognize a few fundamental truths. 1. Bad shit happens. Bad shit will continue to happen. 2. It could be worse. It might even have already been worse. 3. It only gets better when you leave it in the past and move forward. 

This might come off as blunt and unsympathetic, and I'm sorry if it does, but I'm being pragmatic here. You're mental health doesn't improve when you dwell on your shitty past. The more you let it drag you down, the harder it will be to find yourself in a positive situation. All you can do is let go and move forward.

Not to say that simply because something likely won’t yield results isn’t worth thinking about, rather you shouldn’t lose sleep over things that are out of your control :)

BUT! That’s easier said than done lol (getting things out of your head). So something that I do at night when I get too thoughtful is basically a “hard reset.” By that I mean I get up, turn the lights on, and then depending on my mood ill read or something. Then I get back in bed and usually I’m not in a loop of thought anymore :D 

Another thing you could do is if it’s a really deep thought, write it down! In detail! Go into it, and keep it going. Hopefully by expressing those thoughts your brain will feel satisfied :)

If that doesn’t work, and you are still losing sleep, and it’s affecting your health, you should try and see a professional for help if you can :D Or text a therapist!

P.S. it is scary :) And it’s ok to be scared and anxious! Just keep an eye on it, there isn’t a definitive answer.

[],,lampshadelixir,,,[],,,,text,t2_4jh5b0hb,False,False,[],"I'm in a similar-ish boat. About college - you *can* retain the info you need. You could even look up different ways to study and see what works best for you. I know it's easier said than done, especially because it does take a lot of effort and when you are in any sort of depression, effort feels hopeless to muster. Having someone to study with can also be really helpful. You guys can create games out of the material.


Your Dad sounds like he has a stick up his butt. Medication has helped me tremendously, and I actually believe that there will come a point in my life that I won't need it anymore. When I first started medication, I thought I was going to be on it for the rest of my life. That's how crippling my anxiety and depression gets. I don't think I would be alive without the medication.


Interviews. Yea. I struggle hard with interviews. Do you know anyone you could practice with? Look up common interview questions and practice with someone. When I have an interview, I'll call my older sister and have her interview me. She's really smart and very articulate and she helps me find ways to word my answers better or straight up helps me come up with an answer, at times. Once you've practiced and rehearsed with someone, you'd be surprised how much easier it can go. 


The anxiety may still be there, but practicing will help you be more prepared to answer, which sometimes is half the stress.



If you really believe that you would enjoy the work that your degree will offer, I say keep pushing through. The next 2 years may not be easy, but you'll feel really good once you finish. Eventually, you'll even look back at these years with fondness and be proud of yourself. If you have no passion for your degree, maybe it's time to take a step back and explore other options. Student loans are a bitch to pay back, but is it worth your happiness? Is it worth working a job you hate for the rest of your life? 


Sometimes it's good to take a step back and come at a problem from a different angle. A fresh perspective. I highly recommend reading Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself by Dr. Joe Dispenza. It really opened my eyes to creating a fresh a start.

And there shouldn’t be any problem with being a virgin. 

Now I have a few close friends but not much, which means to him that I have no friends. Now the first user didn’t really call me a “pussy”. It was the second user that defended the first user. I’ll call the second user bully. So the bully defended user 1 and told stuff like how I’m a pussy. Now I have deep emotions and it’s because of something that happened last November-December. At school there was this kid that I barely knew that started verbally bullying me for no reason. He called me the stuff that user 1 called me. I can lose it when people say dumb sh*t to me like that without joking. When I say lose it I don’t mean beating the hell out of someone. I just insult them back. So ever since that school incident happens I seem to be more emotional and insecure about myself. 

So this bully was calling me a pussy and a baby and said I was immature. First of all user 1 started this crap. Second of all these people claim that their adults, so they’re the ones immature. Although I doubt they’re adults. I look through their comment history and all they say are toxic and immature stuff to innocent people . Sorry if this was long.

I struggled with this a lot a few years ago, but for me it was intense anxiety more than depression and it was interfering with my life. I can find myself frozen in this paradox where the existence of God and an afterlife seems impossible, but the idea of just ceasing to exist and not having any more conscious experience feels equally impossible. It took me a couple years of struggling with really bad anxiety to work through this to feel more stable. Here are some concepts that have helped me feel better.

* Death is just as natural as life. Everything that has ever lived has died or will die. Even though it is incomprehensible an our most basic instinct is to avoid death it is still a natural process.
* The universe, the human mind, and life itself are extremely complicated and there is so much that we don't know. Scientists don't fully understand consciousness or even know where it is in the brain. No one knows for sure what happens when we die. Maybe we join some greater sense of consciousness, maybe our energy returns to the universe like code returning to a computer program when an NPC ""dies,"" or maybe we do just cease to be. We will never know until it happens.
* It simply does not do any good to worry about this. Obviously there is some value in thinking or wondering about it, but dwelling on this mystery does not benefit your experience now or change the reality of death. You can't make it go away by thinking about it or trying to understand it. You are just creating suffering for yourself.
* Since we don't know what happens when we die, all we know that we have is our lives now. We are having a conscious experience now, and we have some control over what we experience. We can make an effort to do things we enjoy, appreciate wonderful parts of life, and connect with others. We can choose to care about the lives we are living now even without the guarantee that it will ""matter"" in the end.
* Remember that everyone is in the same boat. We are all currently alive, we are afraid to die, and we don't know what is going to happen when we do. We all want to feel happy and loved, and we all have the power to help others on this journey.
* The goal is not to come to terms with death 100% and feel fine about it, but just to be able to engage with life without being weighed down by the inevitability of death. There will be times when it strikes you and you become weighed down by it again, possibly when someone dies, but you can keep striving to move forward and get back to a place where you can balance it with living your life.",,,1590634215,{},fs1roj4,False,t3_gru0jn,False,True,t3_gru0jn,/r/mentalhealth/comments/gru0jn/i_am_too_aware_of_everything/fs1roj4/,1590642367,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,0,[],,,

Why would you logically try if you've convinced yourself being mentally healthy is near important and takes so much effort? You're doing the SANE thing to just ignore that line of thinking and drink vodka instead. 

But obviously, that's not what we want out of life. So you have to convince yourself it's not inside. You don't reach a point of being perfect when it comes to life. Thinking you will and it's just a matter of working hard enough to get there can lead to some toxic patterns. It did for me for a loooong time. 

What helped were those baby steps, yes, but I had to shower myself with praise when I accomplished one small thing (like, taking out the trash. And not just tying it and letting it sit there, but actually taking it down and moving the can to the curb). And then I SMOTHER myself with love and praise and encouragement. I did it! I am so freaking proud of myself!! Yes!! I finished a task!!

And then I did another small task. And another. Etc. 
But I slid back into patterns, which is often, I try not to let negativity grab me but instead say, it's ok, I have been tired today, what can I do instead? And slowly, your mind remembers these positive patterns and naturally goes there instead of the negative.

The lack of energy, that feeling of sand, definitely sounds like depression. Energy is the currency of mental health. If you can find a way to trick your brain to get that energy back, you are on the right track.

For me, especially recently, I try my damn hardest to look at things a different way. Basically, and excuse the cliché, but ""look at the bright side"".  However, I also understand that it's not healthy to try and push emotions away by doing that. It's okay to feel, so do it.  With that being said, focusing on the good instead of the bad is ultimately the goal.  Things that would bother me for a long time bother me for like an hour or two now.  

I also try to not let my emotions, specifically anger, control my actions.  I used to be a very angry person.  After a while it gets tiring, and I figured out a life full of anger is not a life worth living.

I was on medication for my illness, and while it ironically didn't help me at all while I was on it (quite the opposite, I freaked out and smashed my face into a tree) it helped me in the end to realize that there are other ways for me, and I enjoyed life much more while I was not on medication. Take this with a grain of salt, evey one is different.

I've also been learning to take responsibility for my mess ups, instead of blaming others or my illness. I tell myself that I am in control and try not to let my illness control me. 

Here are some other things that have helped:

A book that is helping me a lot is ""You're a Miracle, and a Pain in The Ass"" by Mike McHargue.  I'm not completely done with it, actually only on chapter 4 but it's definitely helped.

Another thing that helped, which may seem really silly, are Uncle Iroh's proverbs helped me a lot. Here are a few from the top of my head so I may get them a bit wrong.

""Sometimes we find ourselves in a dark tunnel, with no end. But if we keep going, you will find the light on the other side ""

""If you look for the light, you will often find it, however if you look for the dark, that's all you'll ever see""

""Sometimes the things that are frightening in the dark are welcoming once you shine a light on them""

I still plan on seeing a therapist when I can though, accepting help is still part of being better.

[],,Up-Town,,,[],,,,text,t2_oi79uhv,False,False,[],"**I’ll have been told I have several different “personalities.”**

Monitor, nobody has *""several different personalities.""* Everyone has only one personality. That's why the American Psychiatric Association dropped the name ""Multiple Personality Disorder"" in 1980 and replaced it with ""Dissociative Identity Disorder."" When a person dissociates very strongly, he can exhibit several different states (or aspects) of his one personality.

**3 years ago I was unofficially diagnosed as bipolar.**

I suggest you speak with your psychologist about the possibility of having moderate-to-strong traits of BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). I also suggest you familiarize yourself with the warning signs for BPD. 

One reason is that you may not be describing only bipolar mood changes. The mood changes caused by bipolar develop from gradual chemical changes in the body. They therefore typically take a week to develop and can last anywhere from a week to several months. In contrast, you seem to be describing some event-triggered releases of anger that develop quickly and typically last several hours. 

A second reason for learning BPD red flags is that therapists sometimes mistake bipolar for BPD. A third reason is that, even if you do have bipolar, that doesn't rule out BPD. It is common for these two disorders to occur together. About 30% of bipolar sufferers also have BPD and 40% of pwBPD have co-occurring bipolar. See Table 3 at [2008 Study in J Clin Psych](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2676679/).

The distinction between these two disorders is very important. Whereas bipolar is caused by a change in body chemistry, BPD is believed to be caused by something occurring before age 5 (heredity and/or a childhood trauma) that prevents the child from acquiring the coping skills needed to regulate her own emotions and establish a strong, stable self identity.

Hence, whereas bipolar oftentimes can be treated quite successfully by swallowing a pill, BPD can only by treated by years of hard work -- in a weekly therapy program such as DBT -- to acquire those missing coping skills. Like learning to play a piano, learning those skills takes many years of practice and strong commitment.

While you're waiting for an appointment with your psychologist, I suggest you take a quick look at my discussions in [12 BPD/Bipolar Differences](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9mj9u8/how_do_bpd_warning_signs_differ_from_those_of/) and in [18 BPD Warning Signs](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9hv2yq/what_are_the_primary_warning_signs_for_bpd/).

I can't talk for your friend because not every anxiety disorder is the samebut things I'd find helpfull are:

-&gt; you can educate yourself on the topic, google, maybe watch youtube videos, check out different sources. It is important to talk to your friend directly as well but when you have a mental illness it can be difficult to feel like you constantly have to explain yourself to other people. So educating yourself on this can help you understand her better and can take the weight off her shoulders of having to explain it all to you. (I don't know you but people who want to help me often ask me a lot of questiond about my mental illness and it gets overwhelming)

-&gt; show understanding. One of the most frustrating things for me is constantly having to hear: ""But why are you afraid of this?"" ""What are you anxious about?"" ""There's no reason to be scared/anxious"".
If she's anxious about something there's very likely nothing you can do to change that. But you can tell her it's okay. You can make her feel validated by letting her know it's okay that she's scared and she is not a burden on you for it.

As someone with anxiety I have a lot of things to say on this but the most important thing to remember is that you are not a therapist, you are a friend.

[],,oODillyOo,,,[],,,,text,t2_4cantx6c,False,False,[],"This is something I have shared to a few people who are also having a lot trouble getting their schoolwork done----

 In regards to your schoolwork, one thing that may be helpful is to get yourself on some type of schedule. It probably sounds unrelated, but by making yourself a routine, it can actually help decrease stress, help you get more organized and focused and balanced, helps you make time for things you need to do so that you aren't overwhelming yourself one day, and under scheduling the next day. So write up a routine for yourself and make yourself stick to it. Get up at the same time each day, eat meals at the same time, schedule in some time for fun and relaxation, time to socialize (safely of course, during this time of health crisis; phone, text, face time, etc), time for exercise, etc. Then schedule in some time to do the school work you need to do.

When it comes time to do the school work you have been putting off, break it into small, do-able amounts, so you don't overwhelm yourself. Put on a timer for a time frame that you feel is attainable, but small, for example, ten minutes the first day. During that ten minutes, for an example, get your homework organized and figure out what you will need to do to complete your schoolwork. If the timer goes off, stop what you are doing, and move on to your next scheduled activity. When tomorrow comes, set your timer again, and do another small part of your assignment/homework. Stop when the timer goes off. Keep doing this until you feel like you could add another five minutes, so fifteen minutes all together to do your school work. Then when comfortable with fifteen, keep slowly increasing the time dedicated to school.

It is easier on our brains to set very small goals, and achieve them, feeling a sense of accomplishment and success , rather than set an unattainable goal, feel like you have failed, and then end up torturing yourself into feeling the task is now impossible and give up. So trick your brain by doing ten minutes to start (or even only five minutes, if that's all you can face for the first few days). Trick yourself into thinking--""anyone can sit at a desk for 5(or 10) minutes and organize their homework"". ""I can do that, I can do schoolwork for 5(or 10) minutes, that's easy"". Then trick your brain into thinking another five minutes added is easy, too. Saying positive messages to yourself about the task can, surprisingly, have a positive effect *over time* about the task at hand. (Think about how if we are saying to our self---oh man, this is too much, I can't do it; we feel defeated and don't give the task a real try and/or give up. But start saying to yourself ""I can do this school work"", ""I can do ten minutes of homework, it is easy to do ten minutes"", ""I've got this, I can do this easily""; then you start to trick yourself into ""feeling"" more positive about the task, too, and end up doing it more successfully). It's kind of like positive affirmations, but specific to your school work.

Then you'll help to create a habit for yourself, by repeating the activity of sitting at your desk, looking at your school work, and doing small, little things, to complete your work (even if it's only writing one or two sentences, or reading two pages). If you stick to it, and keep doing 5, 10, or even 15 minutes a day, it will get easier, you'll surprise yourself. But you have to keep doing it, and keep tricking your brain into thinking this is easy. You can even say to yourself ---I will do ten minutes of schoolwork today, and when I am done, I will give myself a treat (then reward yourself with something you feel is a treat, to give yourself some positive reinforcement for completing your task.",,,1587690663,{},fodv1uo,False,t3_g6y8qt,False,True,t3_g6y8qt,/r/mentalhealth/comments/g6y8qt/idk_how_to_get_myself_to_do_my_goddamn_school_work/fodv1uo/,1587705120,2,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,0,[],,,

[],,oODillyOo,,,[],,,,text,t2_4cantx6c,False,False,[]," Here are some general tips I have been sharing  to possibly help with the isolation due to the virus, so I will copy it here for you to have a read----

Something to consider is limiting your exposure of listening to info about the virus to a few minutes a day, so that you can keep up with the newest information, but not overwhelm yourself. Do what you can to stay informed, but not over loaded.

Do your best to stay in contact with people, even if it has to be over the phone, or text, or face time, if you have people. Do more posting on different subs on Reddit and see if there are some people you can connect to, you might make a new friend or two through that.

If you are a sports fan and your sport has been cancelled, (Example: for me, the NHL was a huge distraction. I'm still getting a little bit of hockey, as they have been airing some 'classic' games). Maybe you could check out your area for any re-runs of games, or even go to YouTube and watch old videos of games, bloopers, best plays, etc.

Open your curtains so you can at least see outside, and let some sun in/natural lighting; it can also give an illusion the room/space is bigger than it really is, hopefully lessening the sense of feeling boxed in.

\-

Sometimes using **Distraction (Self soothing) techniques** can be useful too (especially during this time of isolation because of the health crisis). I will copy a list of activities I use to distract, and maybe some there will be some things you can try (revised list related to isolation right now).----

\-

jig saw puzzles (you can find some online if you can't go buy some)

crossword puzzle books (you can find some online if you can't go buy some)

word search books (you can find some online if you can't go buy some)

paint by numbers sets (not sure if you can do this online or not)

playing cards

drawing pictures

colouring books and crayons/colouring pencils (sounds juvenile, but colouring can be very relaxing and a good distraction technique)

write a poem/story/journal

board games

books (read an old favourite, or find something you normally wouldn't read, to see if you can find something new to enjoy)

craft type kits (maybe start a new hobby that isn't too expensive)

do some chores/cleaning around the house, maybe it's a good time to finish any projects you haven't had time to complete.

exercise (dancing, stretching, skipping, anything that moves your body)

listen to music/songs/sounds you like eg: water sounds/thunder &amp; lightening storms/whale sounds/etc

talk/phone/text a friend/face time/post online

relaxation techniques (Ex: progressive relaxation); deep breathing

sing songs

yoga

light scented candles/incense (relaxing)

take a nap

re-watch a favourite tv show/movie; or watch a new show that is out of your normal genres to watch, you may find something new you like

watch You Tube videos (Ex; Jelle's marble racing, ( [r/JellesMarbleRun](https://www.reddit.com/r/JellesMarbleRun/) ) it is quite fun and mesmorizing) (and the kids might really like this, too)

video games; computer games

make your favourite hot drink, or food you like

write a letter to someone

take a bath/shower with your favourite soaps/bubble bath

read other stories on Reddit (check out some other subs you don't usually read)

Have you ever been curious about a topic, but never had time to research it; do it now, Google is your friend!

Look up a beginners online course for a language you've always been curious about; learn a few phrases

if you are in an apartment with a balcony, (away from others), spend a bit of time on the balcony getting some fresh air, read a book, or magazine, or just sit and watch the clouds or do some deep breathing

\*\*\*\*\*---go for a walk outside only ***IF*** your area is allowing that; practise social distancing and go to a more isolated area if possible; if it is not allowed where you live, follow the appropriate rules.

\-

Also using **Relaxation techniques** can be helpful, especially if your thoughts are having give you some anxiety----

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there. [https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-practice-progressive-muscle-relaxation-3024400](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-practice-progressive-muscle-relaxation-3024400)
3. **Guided imagery**. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes
4. **Mindfulness meditation**. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future.

\- - Also, there is also another Reddit sub that has a lot of good information, maybe check it out for further suggestions.

This may not be kosher here, but I advocate for /very/ careful and infrequent use LSD for treating depression. Unfortunately no nation in the UN can currently offer this therapy to anyone outside of a few studies. You should also seriously do your research and take extensive safety precautions.

People always say, the problem is feeling like letting go of the pain means loving her less, but it doesnt, because she wouldn't want you to languish in misery. I know this intellectually, but I still haven't internalized it. 

Also maybe read The Red Book: Liber Novus, I've found a lot of comfort in it. Other than letting time to its thing, and trying therapy, music is the only escape. But escape isnt all its cracked up to be, it can never last forever. Eventually you will have to get to the task of building a happier life, new dreams, new loves.

Conventional therapy has been no good to me, but thats just me, too many behaviorists in the field, and their methods can only help so much. Though you may wish to try it before taking more extreme measures, maybe you'll get lucky and find a Jungian analyst in your area.

This stuff is very confusing and painful. People are made uncomfortable by grief, so they urge you to move on because they dont want to be there for you, they just want it to be over already. But many people have been where you are and survived it.

I recommend calling a friend even if you don’t feel like bugging them with your depression. You can reach out to people and ask them how they’re doing and it serves a mutual benefit. Truly inquiring about someone’s day to day life can be rewarding. It takes your mind off yourself and gives you perspective. 

Something I literally just thought of this second (which is why I use these boards) is that suicidal thinking is always irrational. Humans are wired to be fearful of death.

[],,vanitysarcasm,,,[],,,,text,t2_72j7ais1,False,False,[],"Hi there! I personally believe that the best way to combat your issues is to first understand them thoroughly. I suggest you try and see if you can identify any triggers before these episodes. Look back and see what started each episode, it might be a thought, a person, an image, a sound, etc. 

When you feel angry as such, try writing it down into a journal, write down everything on your mind and what you feel and think. Then look back at it after, and if you can identify some triggers, then you can be more aware of them and try to avoid them. You can also do an audio recording or a video of yourself. Let yourself ramble on and look back once you feel more stable and calm.

Aside from being a triggered event, this might just be some pent up energy across a few events. Some meditation, mindfulness, or breathing exercises may help you calm down when you're in the middle of these episodes. 

Crying is also a great way to relieve stress. If you're constantly around people, excuse yourself to the bathroom and let it out. You may find it helpful to listen to some sad/angry music to help yourself cry it out and get a release.

I hope you can identify what the root cause of your problems are and get it fixed, best of luck OP!",,,1596512577,{},g0aiag2,False,t3_i3bx0o,False,True,t3_i3bx0o,/r/mentalhealth/comments/i3bx0o/there_is_a_struggle_deep_down_in_me_but_i_cannot/g0aiag2/,1596521312,2,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,0,[],,,

My family keep all medications locked in their room - their door has a lock so I cannot access. Good to see her medications are being controlled by parents. If they aren’t already locked away in a lock box or safe or the parents door is locked it would be best to do that.

When I am bad my parents check my incoming parcels to see if I’m buying things like belts, sharp blades or anything that can be dangerous 
(I have a history of self harm) etc. 

Probably keep an eye out as well in case she gets desperate and tries to go to a chemist for something like Panadol that’s easily accessible. You’d basically just catch her throwing up and throwing up if she took that but it would be hours later, depending on how much confusion can set in as well - I didn’t know what was going on.

Meditation works for a couple of people. And it just does not exist in one form. They are multiple types. It could be in something that you like. Anything after which you feel a sense of calm.

Men legitimately and I believe even physiologically have a harder time crying of sadness or frustration compared to women. There is one area in which we actually cry more easily than women, and that is crying of joy.

I'm not sure what it says about men and women or society. Perhaps that men seek less compassion when they are down because the will or believe they will receive less of it.

I myself used to fantasize about it for this very reason. ""Nobody cares now. But if I died, they would at least care for a day.""

In fact, the method of your self-harm is often associated with how available you think empathy or sympathy would be. Women statistically (and from first-hand experience) often choose slower, less deadly methods because deep down they believe someone would empathize once they had attempted. Every girl I know who has attempted chose methods like pills. In every one of these cases, they group texted everyone afterwards literally calling for help.

Meanwhile, any men I know who attempted are no longer around. People dismiss this as ""men are just violent aggressors and choose violent methods"", rather than analyzing the deeper down issues regarding men's loneliness, isolation, and lack of support lines. Dismissing it as aggression and violence only serves to shame them further and confirm society's apathy.

Sorry, I didn't mean to make this sound like some competition between men and women. These are just aggregates. The point was to highlight that the more support people believe they have, the less destructive they are to themselves and others.

This is a rather rough generation in this regard, and a particularly rough year.

I know you mentioned being okay the past few months but the stress can kind of accumulate without realizing it and then it feels like you hit a wall.

This might sound dumb but exercise can help with the depression and anxiety. It kind of increases your threshold for depression and anxiety. So things that normally would trigger you arent as powerful. I know its probably the last thing you want to do considering you dont have a lot of energy but it will help. Even if its walking in your neighborhood. 

Definitely be honest with your providers though. Tell them you feel like youre sinking but dont need the hospital. Im sure they will try to work with you to keep you out of the hospital.

Definitely try the exercise even if you feel like you cant. It will help you push through this rough patch. Youll get through this even if you feel hopeless right now.

A therapist may be helpful to understand why this is happening specifically for you and come up with tailored strategies to address it. You could go in-person, or there are a lot of services online with quality therapy as well. As always, if at any point how you're feeling is too much for you to handle, even though it's an automod post, the tips on crisis support are helpful. Sometimes it helps just to call in and have someone to listen to what you're experiencing.  
Aside from that, it's already great that you are able to acknowledge the way you feel and the reasons behind those feelings. A useful skill from Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) that touches upon this is the concept of our ""Wise Mind."" We have two parts of our mind that we rely on, our emotional mind and our reasonable mind. Our reasonable mind helps us think logically and objectively, sort of like your bracketed comments in this post. It is concerned with facts and reason. The emotional mind evaluates our life based upon our emotions, feelings and our values. It is the part of us that cares about others, that loves, that grieves, that worries. These parts of our minds often contrast. This is where we can use something called our wise mind. The wise mind listens to both parts of our mind. For example, if someone were to say that they didn't like your favourite video game, our emotional mind may start to spiral, worrying that we may be seen as weird if we liked the game. This is the perfect time for the reasonable mind to come in. We can't stop ourselves from feeling these emotions, but we can use the reasonable mind to balance out our emotional mind. The reasonable mind knows that everyone has their own preferences and that some love your favourite game, and others don't, just like how everyone may or may not like chocolate ice cream. If you find yourself worrying about rejection or being ignored, ask yourself, ""What would my reasonable mind say."" You can even try writing it down! Write down everything your emotional mind is feeling about the situation, everything your reasonable mind is thinking about the situation, and then write one sentence which validates how you're feeling AND reminds yourself of what your reasonable mind is thinking. Mastering this equilibrium takes practice and time; progress is never linear. 

Hope this helps! Feel free to message us if you have any questions

It is also associated with prodromal Parkinsonism. 

I know you said you never recommend benzos, but for RBD, klonopin is the only effective treatment. Some people have success with very high dose melatonin, but for most people clonazepam is only thing that can prevent them from acting out their dreams.

You’re totally right with everything. I know what to do, it’s just finding the starting energy is hard. Ive come a long way and can see that most of my problems are solvable, or at least not impossible to live with. I know they all need me to put effort into to help though, and whilst i’ve gotten better at making some healthy choices I have a way to go on the consistency front. Especially on shutting down negative habits and mindsets when I fee them coming on. 

On the subject of solvable problems - the back pain stems from me having a mild genetic condition that can be managed very easily with regular exercise. By building up my core and back muscles they can act as a support and I would be fine. Genius here has never done that though - and it took me tearing something on one side of my spine, collapsing to the floor and being paralysed from pain for 5 days (no sitting, standing, walking etc) to start taking action. I find it almost funny because it’s almost made me immune to regular pain, my migraines don’t faze me anywhere near as much. Silver linings eh?

[],,CatsPlantsandFear,,,[],,,,text,t2_4ykf4xsg,False,False,[],"I am here just to say that I resonate with this so much. Last year I had a really big bout of something similar to what you're feeling. I have been suicidal for years, but when I started having a similar realization it got a lot worse. I'm less paralyzed now and have learned a lot, but the feeling haven't really gone away... I have just learned how to regulate them.

I just want to say that you are not alone in this. 

Here is my advice take it with spoon of salt because I am not you and I can only share my experience: 

First don't spend anymore time watching or listening to that stuff. I understand the feeling of owing the victims. I really do. But it is clearly making you sick. For me I had to stop watching basically everything I didn't know was safe for my brain. Anything even remotely violent, or sexual would send me down that path internally and still does sometimes.)

I had to involve myself in things that celebrated innocence and beauty, tapping into child like wonder. Spending more time playing. Like doing art, building blanket forts in my apartment, tapping into the things that made me feel innocent and content. I spent time outside and marveled at the tiny, unseen, beautiful things that go missed everyday.

 I started listening to a lot of audio books and I could recommend some if you like! (Though they do have some level of spiritually in them due to my interests. But some don't.)  

I had to take some time and start practicing things that helped to ground me. (Yoga, my faith, and getting off the internet ((ironically)) for me) Things that helped make my fear and hatred smaller. 

I started talking to people about the things I felt. People I trusted mostly but eventually people who I knew less well. 

This one I put on the bottom of the list for a reason. It can be helpful, but it can also make things a lot worse. So be extra careful with it. I  started learning about the human brain, about what made people do such disgustingly evil things. While trying not to be exposed to the evil things themselves. This was hard hard hard, but important for me to understand the human part of human evil.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what I learned ultimately: People harming other people in such unspeakable ways often starts (not always but often) when a child is not cared for. They grow into adults trying to harden themselves to the world to protect themselves huge hurt that was done to them. Doing more and more extreme, rash, and destructive things to try and quiet the pain.  Not to say they don't deserve justice in the strongest meaning of the word. They absolutely do. There is no question about that. But it helps me to understand why the f\*ck (can I swear here?) this is happening. 

When I learned this I decided I didn't want to harden myself anymore. I wanted to be soft and hopeful because even if it burns me to continue to stay soft in this world (not to mention to stay in this world at all) it may help me save someone suffering. I'm better off for it, but I am also in more pain. It is a pain I would rather carry than be ignorant to.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this helps. I don't mean to be preachy in anyway. I didn't mean it to be so long... I just hadn't heard anyone else talk about this feeling before. I hate that you are feeling it too, I hope you can find some hope.",,,1590625625,{},fs1cnhu,False,t3_grs5q7,False,True,t3_grs5q7,/r/mentalhealth/comments/grs5q7/i_cant_cope_with_how_evil_this_world_is_what_do_i/fs1cnhu/,1590634016,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,0,[],,,

[],,oODillyOo,,,[],,,,text,t2_4cantx6c,False,False,[],"I'm sorry that your Hubby is having a rough time right now, and that it is also creating a tough situation for you.  I hope that you will remember to take care of yourself during all this, as a partner with mental health issues can become overwhelming and frustration for the spouse, and you don't want to neglect your own health during this tough time.

Although you didn't mention exactly what he is dealing with, it kind of sounds like depression and anxiety (not trying to diagnose, just trying to figure out what he might be going through, and what you might be able to do to help).  That's great he recognizes he needs help, but probably very frustrating that he won't take the next step, and reach out for help.  If I am guessing, it might be his anxiety that prevents him to do so.

Is he worried about how to express himself if he does go to therapy and/or a Doctor?  If so, perhaps if he were to organize his thoughts/feelings on paper before he goes to an appointment would help.  Sometimes the thought of just sitting there, and trying to figure out how to describe the symptoms one is dealing with can be a bit overwhelming, so perhaps writing it all out onto a note book would help ease his anxiety.  He could take his notes to an appointment with him, and either read off his notes, or even just hand the notes over to the therapist.  If that's not the issue, is he scared to be on his own, and worrying he won't express everything clearly?  If he would feel better if you were in the appointment with him, perhaps that is,something you could consider?  Maybe he just needs you there for moral support, even if you aren't there to do the talking for him.

Unfortunately, he is the one that will have to go to the appointment, so perhaps just keep encouraging him that although he may feel awkward, or embarrassed (or whatever feelings are preventing him from going), that it is okay to need help, it's not a weakness or a failure, we all sometimes just need a bit of help.  Is he afraid he is going to be put in a hospital?  If so, maybe let him know that unless he is considered a danger to himself or others, that won't happen.  Even if he is having 'thoughts', that isn't enough to warrant a hospital stay, he would have to be actively suicidal or threatening others to be considered a danger.  Since he can recognize that others around him (you mentioned sisters/friends) getting help/need help, that he is just as worthy as them, and deserves help, too.

I get the putting off decisions must be frustrating for you, I could see that being a symptom of anxiety.  It can feel overwhelming sometimes to have to decide something.  what if I pick the wrong thing.  What if I make the wrong decision.  What if what I decide doesn't make the other person happy.  Those kinds of thoughts can seem like trying to climb a mountain and seem impossible to pick correctly, so it's easier to put it off.  Maybe reassurance that there is no wrong decision, that whatever he picks is okay.

The lack of motivation to do things can be hard to overcome.  Sometimes what can help is breaking things into very small, achievable goals.  So for example, instead of thinking he has to wash all the dishes, and clean the kitchen, break it into smaller parts like wash dishes for five minutes.  Then take a break, and if they didn't all get done in five minutes, go for another five minutes after a break.  It's kind of like tricking your brain, telling yourself you can wash dishes for five minutes, that's easy to do.  Instead of thinking about having to do a whole sink full of dishes at a time.  So keep tasks small, and achievable.

Same for his school work.  Maybe set a timer for fifteen (or some small, doable goal), and have him tell himself that he can easily do fifteen minutes of homework.  Then when the timer goes off, stop.  Then later, or the next day, or whatever works for him, set the timer for another fifteen minutes. Breaking the work into small achievements.  Our brain feels more positive about things if we see we can achieve these small goals, instead of trying to do too much, not achieving the goal, then feeling like it is impossible.  Hope that makes sense.

I hope your Hubby decides it will be helpful to reach out, and get some help.  Take care of yourself too. Hope you are both feeling better soon.",,,1590623873,{},fs19g4h,False,t3_grsydg,False,True,t3_grsydg,/r/mentalhealth/comments/grsydg/spouse_with_mental_health/fs19g4h/,1590632236,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,0,[],,,

You presented everything so factually, you never said you weren't a mental health professional, that you were just speaking from experience or based off of what you read in a textbook, you never even hinted at room for error, and made no mention of consulting a professional. Imagine if I was young and naive and had never heard of insomnia disorder, while you didn't say ""you have"" or ""I diagnose you with"" you imply it by jumping onto this post, unsolicited, with a factual sounding statement that reads as

&gt;""Disorder name"" symptoms you mentioned in your post

Then you further your implication by saying

&gt; Here are a few strategies that can help you 

Not ""might help"" you wrote ""can help""

As a young, naive kid I'd probably consult Dr. Google next and when the internet mentions the same tips as you did and the symptoms for insomnia match what I posted about it's going to reinforce the belief that you know what you are talking about and that I must have this sleep wake disorder called insomnia. And if I'm young and naive and think I already know what is wrong with me why would I waste time and money to get a second opinion? 

Except in reality there are lots of other reasons I could be displaying these symptoms which is why you should have mentioned going to a professional; I've had problems with my thyroid and heart in the past, I could also be building up tolerance to my current medications, maybe I've developed another condition altogether. The point is you don't know for sure that I have insomnia but if I were more naive I very well could have agreed with your implied diagnosis, chalked my symptoms up to insomnia disorder, and put off going to the doctor until I collapsed at work and was rushed to hospital. 

Unfortunately that's not melodrama, it's pretty much what happened to me when I was 16. I complained of my symptoms to my peers, coworkers, family, was told it was just my anxiety flaring up because it was a stressful time in my life and I took their word for it and never consulted a doctor until I passed out at work.

Maybe that initial reach out to talk about what’s wrong is difficult, and it’ll be difficult for a while but it’ll always be difficult if you don’t try at least a few times. And I know that feeling of feeling bad after talking it out, and it’s very much a vicious circle. 

 But if you feel that you can’t talk to your friends because it makes you feel as if you’re bothering them, I’m always willing to listen, even though I struggle with this as well, I enjoy being the person someone can talk to and talk those things out and get someone else’s perspective about what’s stressing you out or affect you. Because it’s nice to hear someone talk about how they have those same difficulties and it allows you to feel understood more so. 

One thing I do from time to time to help myself to be in a better position for talking to my friends is to find some positive affirmations or mantras to write down and look through to remind myself that I’m not alone and that all the negatives I feel for myself aren’t always true.

I was initially diagnosed with a mild case of depression and anxiety, but by trusting my doctor and working with her to discuss everything, I have since been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and OCD. 

Hydroxyzine for the most part does not work for me personally when it comes to sleep. It does somewhat calm me down when I have a panic attack, but as far as sleep it didn’t do much. 

For me, I take one when I have a panic attack, and that just chills me out. Then when we tried it for sleep, I would take two before bed. It would initially make me groggy, but I never could fall asleep. We have since moved on to different medicines to treat my insomnia, but I still use it for my panic attacks. Again, this is just my personal experience. Everyone reacts differently. 

As far as your anxiety, I will tell you what my doctor told me when I first started working with her: When someone has a heart condition, diabetes, or some other medical condition, people don’t stop or think twice about taking medication to correct the issue when possible. So why shouldn’t we do the same for our mental health? The pills I take for my anxiety have as much weight and importance as the ones I take for my heart condition.

When it was maladaptive it was a form of escapism, but it was uncontrollable and not specific. Basically I pretended to be in books I read, as a main character, coming up with stories of how I lived. But I did it constantly, in school when I was supposed to be learning, in bed when I was supposed to be sleeping, and listening to music in my room for hours at a time just daydreaming and avoiding reality. I come from an abusive home and my father attempted a murder of four, his brother/my uncle murdered two people so when I say violent I mean I felt like I was going to die constantly and without the daydreaming I was afraid of everything.  


 I didn't make up specific scenarios such as you did with the baby mice, does that make sense? If I went through a mentally hard time I would retreat to daydreaming but not about a specific scenario. Anyway, I actually had to get treatment in childhood for it because it became so bad and I would become irritated if someone interrupted my daydreaming and lash out.

Granted i was acting out but i was hurt and angry and miserable that i wasnt getting treated like a kid as an almost adult that i was constantly getting in fights with my mom over this that i was an only child who felt teamed up against in those fights because my parents believe in joint parenting because i constantly had to apologize for said fights but my mom never had to that i was constantly getting crticized by her for not owning up to shit i did but when i pointed out that she does the exact same thing her excuse was ""i do it at work all the time"" that she only apologized to me when she felt like she did something wrong and not when i said i felt hurt a lot of shit she did made me miserable and suicidal and act out cause i had no proper way to vent my feelings.  She went to church she acted nice in public and so everyone who meets her doesnt believe or finds it hard to believe this shit went on and the people i live with (i live in a group home) never say they dont believe me but theyve met my mom and i feel so ungrateful when i hear about their backgrounds and i invalidate myself. A big reason why i couldnt vent was because if i called my friend to vent about arguments i was ""telling on her"" and ""making her look bad"" they psychiatrist i saw while living with them only really heard things from my parents pov cause i didnt feel like i could be open with my parents in the session that they were still going in when i was 18. I didnt ask them not to go in cause i had spent all that mental energy on getting my mom not to go into my therapy sessions with me.

[],,Icantkeepupwith,,,[],,,,text,t2_5mlwyko4,False,False,[],"OCD is deeply personal (I am a Psych student), I actually have C-PTSD that results in OCD tendencies (that being said I am only treated as C-PTSD as the theory is if they treat the repeated traumas that happened to me then they are treating the behaviors in the end as well). OCD can have a multitude of different 'reasons' from safety aspects (not necessarily trauma but can be), to second nature aspects where it just happens without being unable to stop (say a tic), or perfectionism. OCD is an anxiety based behavior so in most cases you are having anxiety to product the OCD behaviors, if you weren't anxious about something (except for in tic cases) you wouldn't produce the behavior.   


When I am at my worst, it looks like an eating disorder. I restrict foods except 'all organic/non gmo/all natural' and bottled water that has been unopened, as I feel something is got into my water that's unnatural or poisonous. I haven't been like that in 5+ years (and it shows lol) I have no body dysmorphia and I don't care if I'm fat or thin. OCD can be mistaken as eating disorders because OCD likes exact numbers of weight going down (I liked 1lb a day when I fasted and .5 a day when I ate a very particular number of calories) and even if it doesn't go down far enough usually an anorexic or EDNOS or bulimic is okay as long as it does down, very often those with OCD will have major breakdowns when the numbers aren't 'right'. This is considered my worst because it's the thing that could kill me. When I get very stressed I start to feel the need to do these things, but reducing my stress I've been able to ride through the feelings of these compulsions and not produce behavior. I also do CBT therapy, and I have a case manager all covered by state insurance.  


Other behaviors I have that are mild but not an issue in my life so I continue them are checking closets many times a day, I don't have a specific number. Checking locks many times a day, sometimes 5, 10, minutes after I first checked, sometimes after I just sat down I have to do it again. It's annoying but it makes me feel safe. I check just about every room in the house, if I don't I have ruminating thoughts someone is in my house. I also check on my baby when sleeping multiple times if I'm up because I see flashes of dead babies in my head if I don't. I got a mirror for the carseat so I can see my baby while driving because otherwise I'd pull over 5-7ish times in the 30 minute drive to my mothers house to make sure he was okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things that are annoying for people to do to me? Well I think over and over again a date/time if someone calls and I make an appointment until I put it in my planner and on the calendar. My calendar is home so it can make me irritable to get home after I get a date and I will dissociate/not respond or respond aggressively if someone interrupts these thoughts until it's on both. I also tend to be silent in car rides and think of random things I need to do, specifically during car rides. So I hate talking in the car and can sometimes come off irritable. (I'm starting to look like a real catch right?) Basically if my cyclical thoughts are interrupted I feel overwhelmed like there's too much going on, and I'm going to forget these 'very important thoughts' and light/sound can make me irritable until I go through with my 'ritual'.

These rituals are meant to keep me on track/safe and so when it's interrupted I feel not safe like I'm going to get in trouble which is where my anxiety/irritability comes from. This stems from childhood abuse of forgetting things and getting more than over the top punishments as well as emotional abuse from being forgetful, same goes for closet/lock checking, as my father is a felon with 4 counts of attempted murder, domestic abuse, and had a former short sentence from 2 sexual assaults - and is now currently out with no parole so I feel like that's why I really don't work too hard on lock checking/room checking because I think that actually does keep me safe.  


Currently I'm working on stunted emotions and explaining when/why I'm irritated, and explaining how I'm feeling instead of snapping at people but not necessarily stopping the behavior if that makes sense? It's up to your friend to decide if these behaviors are getting in the way of life or if it's something they are just explaining to you so you understand that's what makes them feel safe and they want to continue it... Ect. My best suggestion is to communicate and well, ask how they are feeling, if they feel safe, lots of open ended questions to help you support them. That being said, it's their duty to seek help when they need it.",,,1589153672,{},fq7wjvh,False,t3_gh8jco,False,True,t3_gh8jco,/r/mentalhealth/comments/gh8jco/how_do_i_helpgive_advice_to_someone_who_has_ocd/fq7wjvh/,1589158104,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,0,[],,,

Your friend starts to bitch you out for something that didn't happen, but your anxiety takes over and while waiting for him to read and reply , you start going throufht senarios in your head of what might happen. Then he replies with a negative comment, this forcing the senarios to turn all negitve... You reply again and he takes awhile to reply to the next one, but in that time your still running senarios of how this might pan out to the point where you start believing your friend now hates you and you start to emotionally be compromised.

Then before he replys you are already trying to prevent that scenario from happening and maybe you ""tweak"" out on him to the point where when he replys he is like ""Bro what are you talking about ?? I never said that , where is this coming from?"" Then you take a second to look back at the conversation and you see that in-between messages you came up with a distorted view of the conversation in whole. 

When you re-read the conversation once noticing he wasn't even mad at you and you mentally change his tone of his texts, it's just a simple conversation that your mind derailed into something completely else. 


It's called delusions, only if you actually believe that the conversation really happened that way, but once rereading the conversation you notice you added shit along the way. 


otherwise it's completely healthy to run through scenarios in your mind because that is one way to cope with anxiety. Sometimes you need to play out scenarios in your head to see if they might be viable or not.

Often one issue is a symptom of other, much deeper issues, this often happens with self-image. In general, however, self-imagine (mental or physical) is usually not resolved by resolving ""IT"". This is why people don't stop being anorectic or bulimic when they slim down and they don't stop finding things wrong with them after fixing what they hated about themselves.

Sometimes you need to get to the core of the issue and rip it at its roots. But that's usually not done by going at it directly, just as you can't fix someone's issues with their looks by making their eyes more symmetric, they will just start hating their nose afterwards. Maybe they didn't get enough affection during their formative stage and feel unworthy of love so they don't even love themselves. In that case if they learn to be kind to themselves, their confidence will grow and self-image issues will lessen.

Maybe your case is similar and your therapist is approaching this issue from a different angle that she considers more effective. Maybe she feels you're not responding well to this specific issue yet (not everything can be solved right away, sometimes, you need to resolve other things first). Maybe she's not sure how to approach it correctly and maybe her experience is not good enough for this specific issue.

I spent a long long time beating myself up over not being able to cope with what everyone else seemed to be able to cope with. But the truth is, if you are suffering from some form of mental illness, you are fighting a monster of a demon as well as trying to do schoolwork. It's not you're fault.   


I personally have had to take a year off from university after years of blaming myself for not being able to cope. I kept saying, ""But I'm the smart one. I'm supposed to be able to do this!"". The truth was, that it had nothing to do with how smart or determined I was. It was a battle I had to save for another time.  


The good news is, I've met a lot of amazing people who have had to find ways to handle the work alongside their mental health problems. One of them is graduating in a few weeks, another has a double degree in engineering and computer science. Another had to take 5 years off until he figured it all out long enough to thrive in a journalism degree. I've also met others who decided it wasn't for them, and found other paths they are much happier in.   


My advice to you is to not hold too hard on to the traditional way of doing things. Just because you've had it in you're head your whole life that things are going to go a certain way, doesn't mean they have to or even should. Also, use your resources. Talk to your parents, your school, your work. Take it as high as you can go. There are things that can be put in place to support you in most institutions. And finally, don't be too hard on yourself. Your best *is*  good enough.",,,1599451814,{},g4atqsn,False,t3_io0b75,False,True,t3_io0b75,/r/mentalhealth/comments/io0b75/its_hard_to_feel_good_about_your_self_when_all/g4atqsn/,1599451824,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,0,[],,,

At least they should understand, in a perfect world I guess, lol. You could even say it's a medical issue if you're afraid of them judging you, cause it kinda is medical in a way, it's ya brain.

[],,Up-Town,,,[],,,,text,t2_oi79uhv,False,False,[],"Candii, as you likely know, BPD is a spectrum disorder that we all have to some degree. It is a pattern of primitive ego defenses we all use. They become a problem only when our BPD symptoms become so strong and persistent that they undermine our ability to sustain very close LTRs with other adults.

The human condition is that, whenever we experience very intense feelings, our judgment flies out the window because those strong feelings color and distort our perception of other peoples' intentions and motivations. Significantly, this is true for ALL adults.

This is why, whenever we are very angry, we all try hard to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have a chance to cool down. We know we cannot trust our own judgment while we are experiencing intense feelings.

Well, a pwBPD is like this too -- only these distorted perceptions occur far more frequently because he lacks the emotional skills needed to regulate his own emotions. This means that a pwBPD experiences very intense feelings far more frequently than other people.

If you suffer from strong BPD traits, you likely experienced a trauma in early childhood (from inherited genes and/or your environment) that prevented you from acquiring certain emotional skills. Most cities offer treatment programs (e.g., DBT) that can teach you those missing coping skills. 

Until you are able to afford such a treatment program, you can make some progress on your own by acquiring one of the most popular DBT workbooks (ratings and evaluations of those workbooks are available at Big River). Such a workbook can teach you techniques on how to do self soothing; how to regulate your own emotions; how to intellectually challenge intense feelings instead of accepting them as ""facts""; and how to trust others.

It also can teach you how to be ""mindful"" (i.e., to remain in the room instead of escaping in daydreams to the past or future); how to perceive ""object constancy"" (i.e., to see that your partner's personality is essentially unchanged day to day); and how to avoid black-white thinking by learning to tolerate strong mixed feelings, uncertainties, ambiguities, and the other gray areas of interpersonal relationships. 

As soon as you can afford it, I would strongly recommend that you join a treatment program so you can benefit from professional guidance. I applaud your determination to work on addressing your issues!

In the end she got a little thing way worse than my detention since at the time I was full into slime so I just thrown a bunch of cheap home-made slime in her locker a Friday evening, by monday there was a solid 1 inch thick green gel on all of the belongings she had left inside, it was a bit of a dick move I know but I think she deserved it

This virus is putting a lot of strain on everyone in so many different ways and it can definitely make dealing with mental health related issues a whole lot harder. It seems like this is having a huge impact on your life, have you considered reaching out to a professional? 

There are things you can do for yourself though, to try to ease some of the distress, but it does take some commitment on your part. Try to be mindful, for one. Allow these anxieties to enter your head, simply register that they are there and allow them to pass on their own. This means not holding onto them by obsessively thinking about them or trying to force them away. 

Another thing to practice is radical acceptance. This means to accept something, regardless of whether you agree with it or not. You can accept something without approving of it. Refusing to accept the truth of the world because you do not think it should be that way can be very damaging for your mental health and cause you much further anxiety.

I know it has been a long read already but I wanted to provide some suggestions that you could implement in your daily life. I also want to talk about your main question. Wether or not you should look for a new therapist. To be honest about it right away, this is not a question I can answer for you. This is a choice you have to make yourself, but I do want to provide some extra information on the subject. Therapy is a difficult job and is always a ""two way street"". The therapist has to put in their work, but so do you. I can not make any statements on who or potentially even both is not putting in enough work, as there is no way for me to know. This judgement will eventually come down to you. To illustrate this a bit better I want to touch on the subject of your therapist calling you a negative person. A part of therapy is trying to point out and help to reflect on certain behavioural- or thought patterns. Seeing things in a negative way can be one of those and it is possible your therapist tried to help you reflect on this to see how you feel/think about it. However, since it did not come across to you as if your therapist was trying to do so and it felt like a personal attack to you, this therapist might not have actually intended to help you reflect or have done so poorly (again this is very hard to be a judge on for me as there is no way of knowing). 

But one simple main component of therapy should always be considered. You need to feel comfortable with the therapist. If you do not feel comfortable with your therapist, the first step would always be to inform your therapist about this (as you did) and see if you can improve the relationship back to a workable relationship. But this is not the only issue you are having with this therapist. All of them together might give you the feeling that the work relationship is not repairable or like you mentioned, you might not even want to bother to try anymore (which is a very valid argument). If this is the case I think it is not a bad idea to consider other therapists as an option. But before making this choice I would like to advice to ask yourself what part you played in this. What I mean by this is that it is often seen that people tend to want to switch therapists when this therapist has hurt them emotionally. This is a valid reason to do so, but sometimes we got hurt by a therapist because they tried to show us or help us reflect on parts of ourselves or our problem that hurt us when we face them. If this is an essential part of the problem, we will have to face it at some point anyway and changing therapist might only delay that from happening.

Again, wether or not this is the case here, I can not say. This will be up to your own judgement. I just wanted to try and provide some insight in the other side of the coin in therapy so that you can make an informed decision on how you want to proceed with your therapy.

I hope this has been helpful to you in any way. If you have any questions or want to talk some more about anything, please feel free to let me know. Also feel free for any further clarification on the things I have said if you feel like you want some extra explanation on what I meant.

[],,scottp95,,,[],,,,text,t2_2jd9jpv1,False,False,[],"Hi again,

Sorry that it took so long, I only had brief moments of time today and did not want to write a full reply without having the time to fully try to answer the questions you are asking and discuss the mutliple points you mention in your post. 

First off I want to say that what you describe going to seems like a huge pile of different problems and sounds like a real handful to have to deal with every day. Despite all of that I am glad to hear that you still show motivation to wanting to improve and seem to take your mental health care seriously and want to take action in it. 

As I understand from your post there seem to be 3 bigger problems currently active in your life. Please correct me if I am wrong and feel free to add if I missed anything. It seems like you are a bit in conflict between wanting to lose weight, while also struggeling with a decline in your mental health, whilst not feeling comfortable with your current therapist. I would like to address each of these parts individually and talk about the more holistic situation a bit later.

I first want to talk about the desire for weight loss. Weight loss (despite what some may think) is not an easy task. It is a relatively simple task (simple in the sense of not complicated) but not an easy one. To clarify this, I mean that weight loss works on a simple principle, have less calories as intake then your body uses, so it uses it's fatty reserves and through this you can lose weight. The reason I want to specifically say this is because I know that many different aproaches to weight loss exists and most of them try to advertise their method as a ""miracle product"". Yet sadly most of that does not really work the way they often promise. Even though weight loss works on simple principles it certainly is not easy to do. There is a lot of information about food that we often do not know about and foods that seem healthy might sometimes be less effective for losing weight than we expect. For this I would like to recommend (if you have this as an available option) to consider a few consults with a dietician who might be able to help you find an achieveable diet for you. The reason I specify ""achieveable diet"" is because losing weight does not have to be perfect. It does not have to be super optimal and a 100% discipline all the time. As this is extremely difficult, especially when already struggeling with a lot of mental stress. It can help to try and find a way of ajusting your diet that is sustainable for the long term and is manageable for you in your current living situation when it comes to disciplinairy demand on yourself. As the simple fact to losing weight is ""progress is progress"". Even the smallest loss in weight is worth the effort and helps to improve your health in the long run. Trying to set the bar too high for what is personally achieveable for you at this moment might bring more set backs than progress. Taking it slower might make it take a bit longer, but again, progress is progress. 

I especially would advice this way of trying to approach weight loss, given your current situation. Trying to actively lose weight is always a stressful situation and it sounds to me like you are already under a lot of stress in your daily life. I am impressed to see the amount of effort you already put into trying to improve your life. Even reaching out on this subreddit is an adamant display of your will to improve. The build up of ""body shaming"" you describe from your youth is something that can take a big toll on a person's confidence and self-image. It is very difficult to deal with this and the suicidal thoughts you have been experiencing, on your own. So I am very glad to hear that you have already reached out found counseling. In case it has not been acknowledged yet, I want you to know that it is a big step and is something to be proud of. Taking care of your own mental health is serious bussiness and I am glad to see you are already very proactive in this. I am not a therapist myself and do not claim to be able to solve all your problems for you, but would like to make a few suggestions to consider that might help your situation. As you mentioned you have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. You also mentioned that your husband is struggeling with depression and you did not want to lean too much on him. I do not know if you guys might already be doing this, but how open is the communication between you two about the problems you are experiencing? I understand the feeling that you do not want to burden someone with your pain when you already notice that they are dealing with their own pain. But sometimes having eachother, who both are in similar situations, to talk to can help a lot to alleviate daily stress (as counseling might not be available daily). 

In the way of talking to eachother I mean that you talk to eachother purely for support, not practical support, but emotional support. You do not have to solve eachothers problems (if you can that is a nice bonus ofcourse) but just having someone that you trust to openly tell what has been going on with you today or the last few days can help to feel more comfortable and have a more structured way of venting stress. A thing you could try for instance is to plan daily or bi-daily talks with eachother. This does not have to be a long talk or a serious talk, but something as simple as, after your son's bedtime when you have time alone on a set time, for example 21:00, you each take 15 minutes and just talk about what you want about today or today and yesterday. You can talk about your toughts, feelings, things you did, things you liked or did not like about the day, anything that comes to mind really. And all of that in the context of just talking to eachother. Neither of you is obligated to help the other with something or needs to feel pressured in ""having to be there for the other"". It is just plain and open, mutual, talking and listening. Doing this might give you both a healthy and low pressure/expectation way of venting what has been going on with you. It might also be a good idea as this can improve open communication between you two to keep (or help get back to) the two of you working together on yourselves. As it is often the case in couples with mental health problems that, in our desire to not burden the other, we drift away from eachother instead of being able to support eachother. If you two find this helpful or pleasant, you could even consider couples therapy. Not the kind to actively work on a relation (as I do not know if this is needed) but there are possibilities to both have individual therapy with a couples element implemented to learn how you can both help eachother out better with the same struggles you are facing. 

Besides these and other possibilities you could try to work into your life yourself, it is always very adviceable to stay in therapy if you feel the slightest need to do so.

But it's not your fault you struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts. Those are true challenges and you can only be expected to do what you can. So it's ok if you slip up and say or do the wrong thing sometimes. You're allowed to make mistakes - we all are.

Sometimes I find that time is the only thing that helps make these huge, emotionally charged situations diffuse, which is awful because all my brain ever wants to do is solve the problem/make up with my friends as fast as possible. But, time plays a really important role in healing. The only thing to do sometimes is take it hour by hour, day by day.

My heart goes out to you - it can be so awful to feel as though people aren't happy with you. But you can do and say the wrong thing and that doesn't mean you're a bad person. Keep writing those apology letters, even if you don't send them. It's good to have a place to put your feelings while you give others the space and time they need.

I wouldn't say they left me; probably the other way around, to be honest. I overanalyzed everything they said and did to the point that it translated to their hating me and wanting me to leave them alone. I know the mind can be treacherous so I can't be sure if that was true or not. But I do know I didn't treat them as well as they deserved (I was whiny, sought attention and validation and took too many things for granted and was super annoying).


I think it just happened casually. We became busy and I used that as an excuse to slowly inch away from them. Eventually they didn't question it and we stopped talking but I still worry that they thought I was angry or hated them and I can't stop hating myself for being so dismissive towards them.

I knew throughout this whole thing I didn't have a mental illness and was merely drug affected but I was court mandated to see a psychiatrist and continue taking antipsychotic injections of palperidone every month.

Without being suicidal, it's the first time I pondered that life wasn't worth living.

Six months of my life was taken due to these drugs. I've now been off them for a month and finally I feel like I'm better. Because antipsychotics aren't psychoactive I didn't feel anything from them so I didn't notice that they were doing anything so I felt like I messed my brain up from the drugs and would never return to normal.

I have had suicidal thoughts almost daily ever since then, but they have gotten worse when I’m isolated. I haven’t got the chance to go to therapy yet, and the social distancing has made it impossible to get professional help besides hospitalization. 

This isn’t completely bad for us since we still have family, I’m 18 so I live with my parents. Sometimes I’ll just go and vent to my mom and let out all emotions, I’ll just bawl my eyes out. It seems to help since I haven’t been able to cry on my own. If you feel like you might act on your thoughts then call 911 and get hospitalized, it’s safer especially if you feel like you’re in danger. If you feel somewhat unsafe then surround yourself with your family, this has helped me because it makes me think about them more and I feel loved. 

Just keep in mind that there is always hope, and I know that sounds cliché as fuck but I promise life isn’t always miserable. As time goes by we will see advances in treatments for depression and suicidal ideation. Right now Ketamine has proven to be a very effective treatment for both depression and suicidal ideation, it is administered in a medical environment not a recreational way. Patients who receive the Ketamine infusion report that they have a significant decrease in their depression and suicidal thoughts in a very short time span, usually around 24 hours. This is a huge step for depression, and Ketamine nasal sprays have been approved by the FDA, but it’s for people who have treatment resistant depression (meaning that most antidepressants aren’t effective).

Magic mushrooms have also proven to significantly improve depression, and there are trails now to get it approved as a medicine.

&gt; When do suicidal thoughts occur?

It is not complex. Your level of pain and suffering reaches way more than you are able to handle. This becomes an option for your mind. And there are so many behaviors and other signs before you get to a suicidal state. Most of us ignore them. 

&gt; Why do we have suicidal thoughts?

All this paragraph. It seems you've figured out what it is yet you are denying it a little bit. Brain is not dumb, it is smart as fuck. And it is not ironic when one of the solutions to an overwhelming amount of pain is to stop living.

&gt; Look Inward to understand yourself more.

If you have suicidal thoughts that already means that you are struggling way more than you could handle. Suggesting to look inside is a very dangerous advice. At this point therapy and all other support is what needed to help a struggling person. Most of us or maybe even all of us, have some trauma. The most obvious traumas that you see are usually complex traumas. 

Most people (yes even therapists because it is harder to help oneself) are not skillful to do this while they are feeling well so, again, suggesting for them to do introspecting while they have suicidal thoughts is life-threatening.

It's like a weird last resort that my brain has gotten used to using as it's first resort (not that it's good in any situation).

I think it comes down to anger management as well, less for the sake of others and more for me, because I'm always the one I end up hurting. I was never really allowed to express anger as a kid so I always directed it inward, and I'm just kind of constantly filled with a seething ball of self hatred because of it. That and it's hard to get self harm under control because punching myself has become a nervous tick and uh, I can't really throw away my hands. I really wish childhood me chose a less accessible way to hurt myself because it makes it way harder stop and it scares my roommates

but I'm trying to get it contained and definitely doing better, I just have to keep working. Most of the time it kicks in that I can remove myself from stressor before it happens (since I've been on meds), but some situations are tougher than others. That being said, learning to deal with them just takes time. I'm realizing that I really need to take more personal accountability with it too. it's my fist, not theirs. I'm still not sure if the psych ward is a good option rn but i gotta realize it's up to me to get this shit under control and communicate when it's building up

I think your medication might not be working 100% tbh. I'm no doctor but definitely sounds like intrusive thoughts which are almost always an anxiety based symptom. A weird sort of coping strategy your brain attempts.


I'd definitely go back to the doctor and tell them again. If possible get a different doctor. Be insistent it isn't normal for you to feel like this.
It may even be a side effect of your meds, has it occurred for longer than your meds?

Also see about CBT for the intrusive thoughts. It basically helps you to understand them. And feel comfortable with them. They're not a reflection of anything except anxiety. They don't mean anything and you'll never carry them out.
The moment you can click that you can start letting them happen and ignoring them, without shouting over them. shouting over them makes it worse.

[],,oODillyOo,,,[],,,,text,t2_4cantx6c,False,False,[],"If you feel you are in immediate danger and/or suicidal, you can go to the hospital if you need to.  Just keep in mind things are pretty jammed up right now with the corona virus, so maybe phone the hospital first and see if you can go, and prepare to have a long wait to get admitted, as there are some pretty sick people (physically) out there needing immediate attention. So see if your local hospital is even taking people who need psych intervention, or if there is a different hospital you should be going to instead.  (They may be changing their usual routine of who gets admitted where because of the virus right now).

In the meantime, if you stay home, perhaps challenge your thinking about how to keep yourself safe.  From what you have shared here, it comes across as you focusing on what your roommates are doing, and it is coming across as if you feel they caused you to self harm. (I'm not saying that is what you are doing, just the way it was written out comes across that way).   I understand what you are saying, in that they are doing and/or saying things that you feel are increasing your stress.  I'm sorry if that is happening to you.  Especially during this time of health crisis, we all need to stick together, not antagonize each other.  But keep in mind, you have complete control over your own actions, even if it doesn't *""feel""* like that right now.  For some people (may or may not be something that applies to you) the urge to self harm partly comes from the feeling of having no control over what is happening to them, or around them.  So self harm feels like a way to regain control (yes, there are *many* other reasons one may self harm, just pointing out that for *some* people, control can be *one* factor).  Keeping that in mind, it is also in your control to not self harm, as hard as that might seem for you.

So even if someone is pushing you to do or not do something (example- you mentioned they were 'pushing your boundaries'), it still comes down to you, choosing to or not choosing to, self harm.  So if you are trying to avoid going to the hospital, maybe you could focus on taking control of the self harm, by choosing not to use that to cope, and to use a different coping method.  Whether that be removing yourself from the stressful situation with your roommates (even if it is just going to your own room, since there are social distancing/going out in public issues right now), doing some relaxation techniques, or something that you find useful to deal with your stress (besides self harm).  Perhaps using a distraction technique of some kind.

I know this is hard to do (I used to self harm many years ago, too), but if you are trying to stay out of the hospital while all the corona virus is such an issue, trying to change how you view the self harm may be the way to go.  Since we can't change other people (you can't ""make"" your roommates behave a certain way), but you can make a change for yourself, by committing to not self harm.  If you need support, hopefully your roommates can help, (if for example, you give them your self harm tools, or they throw them out for you, to get rid of temptation).  Then use a coping method that will help you distract from the self harm thoughts.

I'll copy a list of distraction ideas I use, and some relaxation techniques you could look at and try, hopefully something in there will be something you are willing to try (they are revised to take into account the current situation of having to isolate right now)---------

write a poem/story/journal

board games

books (read an old favourite, or find something you normally wouldn't read, to see if you can find something new to enjoy)

do some chores around the house, maybe it's a good time to finish any projects you haven't had time to complete.

exercise (dancing, stretching, skipping, anything that moves your body)

listen to music/songs/sounds you like eg: water sounds/thunder &amp; lightening storms/whale sounds/etc

talk/phone/text a friend/face time/post online

relaxation techniques (Ex: progressive relaxation); deep breathing

sing songs

take a nap

re-watch a favourite tv show/movie; or watch a new show that is out of your normal genres to watch, you may find something new you like

watch You Tube videos (Ex; Jelle's marble racing, ( [r/JellesMarbleRun](https://www.reddit.com/r/JellesMarbleRun/) ) it is quite fun and mesmorizing) (and the kids might really like this, too)

video games; computer games

make your favourite hot drink, or food you like

write a letter to someone

take a bath/shower with your favourite soaps/bubble bath

read other stories on Reddit (check out some other subs you don't usually read)

if you are in an apartment with a balcony, (away from others), spend a bit of time on the balcony getting some fresh air, read a book, or magazine, or just sit and watch the clouds or do some deep breathing

\*\*\*\*\*---go for a walk outside only ***IF*** your area is allowing that; practise social distancing and go to a more isolated area if possible; if it is not allowed where you live, follow the appropriate rules.

**Relaxation techniques----** (I prefer # 2 &amp; 3; it does take practise, one or two times won't do much)----

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations. 
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there. [https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-practice-progressive-muscle-relaxation-3024400](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-practice-progressive-muscle-relaxation-3024400)
3. **Guided imagery**. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes
4. **Mindfulness meditation**.

I hope you can find something that helps you, and that you can stay safe during this stressful time.  Ultimately though, if your life is in danger, go to the hospital.

I have also hallucinated things like a figure in my closet and stuff like that. This is really common and a lot of people who don't have schizophrenia have this. 

But what concerns me is that you also experience this during the day when you're fully awake. It could be that your brain is just tired. But you should definitely talk to a professional about that, cause you never know. I don't mean to scare you by saying that. I used to have really bad intrusive thoughts during the day, I would see things I didn't want to see or have random involuntary images flash in my mind when I closed my eyes.

This is an awful clinician. It sounds like a psychiatrist that did one of those 15 min appointments. For your first time meeting them it should be longer than that. They have to take in your family history at minimum. I hate that happened to you. Honestly. 

But I'd caution on complete self-diagnosis. You know yourself best. So please by all means translate that to your counselor. You can say that you believe you have XYZ disorder because ABC. They might confirm your suspicion or depending on what's going on in your life diagnose you differently.

It matters because sometimes a clinical eye can spot the difference and you don't have to waste time with the wrong treatment. 

Like Major Depressive Disorder, Postpartum depression, and Dysthmia have similar symptoms (sadness, fatigue, loss of interest) but differ in how long you've been experiencing symptoms. If you've had symptoms for a few years you don't want treatment catered to someone who's had it for a few months. 

And specifically OP, you might have to find guidance and help yourself. They just might not have the insight to understand what you need. But you do. When I was 18 I ran to therapy instead of the club. Once I found a good therapist, life got easier. And I knew how to cope on the days it's not. Being your own advocate sucks but it's not impossible.

It's understandable you're frustrated and I think our society is most definitely failing next generation. But... a big part of a healthy life is appreciating the big picture and appreciating the simple things. If you're not getting any satisfaction out of your education and life, then maybe it's time for a change. Many, many people have been in debt their entire lives, but have also lived happy, full lives. Many,, many people have lived low-income lives, and yet found fulfillment.

There are some things you'll never be able to change (although the changes are worth fighting for, for the sake of the younger generation), but does that mean you have to be miserable for the rest of your life? It may *feel* that way, but I don't believe it is so. I felt that way when I was depressed and I blamed financial circumstances, and now I don't. Funny thing is that I'm no better off financially than I was before. 

Society pisses me off, too. Our government pisses me off. It's worse than it's ever been in a long time. But at a certain point, it's okay to stop thinking about it and move on with your life. There are countries much worse than ours where people are happier. Similarly, they did a study where they found that bronze medalists in the olympics are happier than silver medalists. It's because as a country, we have the potential to be so much more than we are, just like that silver medalist probably saw that they *could* have been a gold medalist, and missing out on it is just disappointing. 

But in the end, does it really matter? We are among more than 7 billion people, many of whom are in complete abject poverty. We really don't have it that bad. 

So in that sense, it's a matter of perspective.

Secondly, it is hard to determine what would be the best course of action, since you didn’t specify what the medication she was being recommended is for, but please don’t feel pressured to. If you think she will harm herself or others, seek the help of professionals and/or the police if necessary.

If she is not immediately in danger of hurting herself or others, it may just take your mom sometime to accept that she needs the medicine. 

I have a personal example of this. When I was in high school, both my mom and I were diagnosed with depression. I got on medication. She didn’t. The doctor recommended medication for my mom, but she didn’t like the idea of taking medication, she was worried she would become too reliant on it, and lose who she really was by taking it. Here we are, ten years and a heart problem later, and my mom finally agreed to medication. Do I wish she had listened to me those ten years ago and just taken the meds? Of course. Does it hurt that she suffered because she didn’t? Yes, it hurts so much. But there was nothing I could have done. I begged, I pleaded, but she needed to accept her need for medicine in her own time.

A lot of people think ‘anxiety’ is synonymous with ‘stressed.’ Same with ‘depressed’ and ‘sad.’ I don’t think that all people who incorrectly use these words know they’re doing anything wrong. They’re just not really aware of what anxiety and depression actually are.  Them saying “my anxiety is just so bad today” is like saying “I feel so uptight today,” or something similar. 

It’s a different story when people say they’re going through depressive episodes or are having anxiety attacks when they’re actually not. If they actually understand terminology/ what both words mean and continue to use them for attention, pity, etc, that’s when it becomes a problem. 

It’s also interesting how people who do struggle with anxiety or depression often are hesitant to use the words. Because it’s not typically something to be proud of, it can feel weird to bring up. Hence why we often make the same excuses of being tired, stressed, etc.

Your frustration is valid. It can be hard to see someone openly talk about / minimize a problem you’re silently fighting. Just make sure that your family member is 1. Okay and 2.

I won't bother with a life of story of mine about traumatic experiences etc. but I know exactly what it's like. Today was actually my first day seeing a psychologist, even though I was forced by my mother who realised of the hole that I was falling into and made decisions without my consent. Of course that's not necessarily a good thing but after just a first meeting I can say that it helps, if therapy is an option for you considering factors such as your family's financial stability, etc, i would recommend it. But even before you think about therapy, I recommend reaching out to family first. I know it's not easy to find the strength to open up to them, but if you can find it, it is most certainly worth it. I am unsure about if you have any traumatic experiences as well but I could not find myself telling my mother about my suicide attempts and self harm that I did / continues to try to do. But of course it is all up to you. I would continue to talk about my experience with therapy but I'm about to make a text post about it in a few minutes so you can read it when it goes up. The one thing I will recommend to you more than anything is to search for emotional outlet. I personally listen to music, paint, read, write (poetry sometimes), rarely exercise (but i am making an attempt to do it again) and play an instrument.

I’m not judging anyone for saying they feel depressed. Their feelings are valid, whatever they may be. If you think your child has depression though, you should do something about it. I’m sorry if this came off in anyway rude in my original post. I don’t judge anyone for feeling what they feel, it’s when the terms are thrown around loosely that bothers me. I’ve also heard her mention having panic attacks, but just saying that because she said she was really worried. She also makes jokes about getting therapy. Also used the word ‘traumatized’ to describe a situation where another family member was just a bit upset. 

Seriously, if I sounded rude, I’m sincerely sorry. I guess I’m just pretty upset about things that have been happening recently.

Most schools will let you take a semester or two off if you need to without affecting your status as an enrolled student. Logically, it’s better to take some time off and graduate late, than it is to fail classes you paid for and still graduate late. 

I went to Pharmacy school right out of high school and it was a disaster. I failed most of my classes in my first year, and in my 3rd semester I simply stopped going. I kept getting calls from the school asking if I was still alive. I basically freaked the fuck out, but it’s not like I had a breakdown or anything, I wasn’t outwardly stressed, in fact I mostly just binged a lot of Netflix and slept a lot. There’s no quick fix to motivation. 

It’s not that I didn’t want to be a pharmacist. I knew that would be a great career, but I was too overwhelmed. There was too much pressure from my family. They’d always be so excited I’d be making a lot of money. 

Eventually, I ended up at a state university pursuing a Bachelor of Arts! So different! I was more than just casually interested in my classes. Like yeah, sure, biology and chemistry are interesting subjects, but at the university level you have to be genuinely interested in all the little things involved with your major. 

If you really don’t feel comfortable taking an absence, you may want to explore changing majors, or become undeclared and just focus on your geneds until you can catch your breath, it’ll take the pressure off. You can also consider being a part time student. That’ll take A LOT of the pressure off, and it’ll give you some time to get a part time job which will give you some perspective.

Sorry this was such a long-winded answer, I feel like I’ve been more/less in your situation and the biggest mistake I made was not coming clean about how I was feeling to not only the university staff, but also my family members who would have been horrified to see how much I was struggling. The best decision I made was switching to a community school to just focus on my gen-Ed requirements while I really thought hard about what I wanted.

While others, it weighs in the back of your mind, wondering if you are just overreacting or if it was truly wrong. 

Most of the time when children are abused and act out in sexual ways tends to be a result of sexual abuse. Yet, it could also be that when one lacks parental, emotional care or responses, children and teens will reach out and try and find ways to gain attention and emotional responses.

My little sister did something similar. She has BPD. We share a mother but different fathers. Our parents (My stepfather is my Dad but not my father) weren't always the most emotional available. Then when our mother had been arrested, we separated and my stepfather had her. He had to work so she was left with our Mimi most of the time. My mother came back around but was so busy with work, drug court, and just the house that she wasn't emotionally there most of the time. My stepfather turned for the worst and stayed with my mother, but shut himself away more. She didn't have people she could emotionally depend on. One way she did was my messaging older men, but never came as far as you did. My parents are better now, and have worked through their issues and are better emotionally for us. Yet, my sister still struggles with needing reassurance, support, care ect. And if she can't find what she needs, she will seek it else where.

It is possible that because your parents weren't there to emotionally support you from a young age, to try and seek it else where.

This is going to be extremely painful because he has to choose to take care of his condition, and he needs the consequences of not doing so made clear.

It can be fatal. I say this, because without appropriate sense of self-responsibility, he could get himself into all kinds of situations and he hurt because of not handling them correctly. For example, lack of listening to anyone or taking anything other than her own feelings seriously led to my birth mother contracting and dying from COVID.

You need the constant advice of mental health professionals - with second opinions - if you're going to stand a chance of both helping him and being able to handle the mental stress of doing so.

Appropriating the problems of other people is a really common thing they do. This is done either to fit in, a prioritization of fantasy over reality, or a desire to run away from the actual problem and yet still get medical attention for *something* and to validate their detrimental escapism and avoidance etc.

I know it sounds unhelpful but in my case i just wanted feelings to go away, i could not feel sadness or anger i just couldnt identify the emotion and let it be, i just did not want it.

Now i can and i still sometimes have those feelings, but much less. I dont know if its the same but it sounds similar, like highly stressed out moments and such. It took me 2 years to understand and diminish it, maybe this is totally off, ofcourse, but maybe you cannot handle emotions and it fucks with your head.

I hope you read my text before you make any decision.

I had a relationship with a person who was suicidal. I think I didn't realize back then the extent of her depression and the seriousness of her suicidal thoughts. She attempted suicide shortly after we broke up. Fortunately, she survived. We kept in touch as friends. About half a year later, she expressed an intent on taking her life again. I was there for her, listened to her, and she snapped out of it. Sometimes, the only thing we need is to be listened to. 

Suicide destroys people. My ex-gf's best friend took her life. I don't think it's selfish, that's a terrible thing to call someone who is struggling. But it does leave a mark on people, even if you don't think people care. I do think everyone can find a light, and I know there's always hope. Killing yourself isn't worth it.

I understand the feeling of, sometimes, just wanting to disappear. I have felt it too, before. I know it doesn't feel like it, sometimes, but there's always hope. Life can be hard, and people can suck, but there's also light, and kindness. Please reach out to someone who cares about you. If there isn't anyone you feel confortable talking to, call an emergency service. You can also talk to me or someone else that's replying to your post and you feel you can open up to.

Lastly, I believe - no, I am absolutely sure - there's an afterlife. I don't know what it entails. Im inclined to believe that, despite what people say, God will not judge you if you take your life, nor will you burn in hell for eternity. But I believe that you will judge yourself, that we judge ourselves when we die. I believe you will then understand how your death will affect people around you negatively, and that there will be sorrow and you will be missed, how things might have worked out differently. I don't know what you believe, and I don't mean to impose my beliefs on you, but consider for a moment that death might not be the end. What then? You have control over this life, but you know nothing of the next. How can you be sure you will find relief? How can you be sure it's better on the other end? You don't know what will happen. You don't know what might happen in this life, either. There's always hope in a brighter future, even if it doesn't seem like it right now.

You're not alone, friend. We're here.",,,1611196642,{},gk0ow1w,False,t3_l1iy9e,False,True,t3_l1iy9e,/r/mentalhealth/comments/l1iy9e/i_want_to_jump_to_my_death_already_why_cant_i_do/gk0ow1w/,1611329053,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,0,[],,,

When it comes to any sort of facility, I guess we must trust and rely on the people that are running it and are working there. 

Unfortunately, sometimes those institutions aren't regulated as much as they should be and the staff that work there are either insufficiently trained, or they are absolutely not suited to the job, even after having been vetted for the position (as you have seen yourself, vetting and deciding that a certain individual is in some way 'qualified' to work in this position, absolutely does not mean they are suited and can help.)

All I can say is that I am so so sorry that this was your experience. I can also promise you that there are individuals out there, whether in an institutional or otherwise setting, that are much, MUCH more suited and qualified to help you with your struggles. It absolutely SUCKS that this is something you have to seek out yourself, as you are the one in such turmoil and pain, but sadly so many people are in the field of 'helping others psychology' that may be 'qualified', but are the exact wrong person to actually help. (Though I'd like to note, not all, some are brilltiant.) 

I feel like I'm rambling now... But please keep reaching our for help. If one doctor or psych or... whoever the fuck, dismisses your issues or belittles you, you cut them loose and keep searching. That in itself can seem so unfair and like such a massive task, but that is your objective. It is difficult, often you want to throw in the towel and give in to the demons. I beg you not to.

Have concrete details planned, like: what kind of therapy do you guys want her to have, and how often? Does she need to be committed somewhere for a time? This is definitely worth discussing with a crisis center or something, but here’s what I what I’d suggest: 


I’d start off with something small, like: seeing a psychiatrist and starting once-per-week therapy. If she balks at the psychiatrist (I know I did at first), then just try the therapist first. You could even agree to family therapy if that’s the only option she’d consider. Then, you can take the recommendations of her therapist from there. 

I also recommend, during this conversation, Instead of describing her delusions, describe the negative emotions she experiences because of them: “mom, you’re so scared and angry all the time. We feel like you’re pushing us away. We’re worried about you. We want to be close to you, but we can’t if you continue this way. We think a therapist can relieve your pain. We love you and we just want to help you.” Her paranoia makes her distrustful, so the calmer and more compassionate you can be, the better. Don’t debate reality, just assert your feelings. She can’t argue that you’re feelings aren’t real the way she can argue that her delusions are true.",,,1596499189,{},g09u4mp,False,t3_i2vyom,False,True,t1_g09ex5r,/r/mentalhealth/comments/i2vyom/my18f_mom48f_hears_voices_in_her_head_telling_her/g09u4mp/,1596508778,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,0,[],,,

Just by reading what you've shared with us here I can really tell you love and care about your family and you're very concerned about others as well. We all get stressed and accidents can happen. It takes a lot of courage to examine and share how you feel and how you might've almost been involved in a serious accident today too. It's okay to take a deep breath, and the best thing you can do is learn from that experience the best you can. Remember for next time that all of that stress can compound and take already stressful situations and turn them into worse ones.

As for your family, how you feel is totally understandable. As you'll learn for yourself soon enough, adult life is really learning how to balance your personal life, your family life, and your career/home life. Your job, you, and your loved ones are all really important. In the end, no matter how disappointing it may be, I would do what is best for you even if that means going to work. I know it may be really embarrassing, but it never hurts to try approaching your manager even if you've already done so. It takes a lot of courage, but you can be open and admit that ""Hey, I'm really sorry for the confusion but the date I told you is actually not going to work, would this work instead?"". A lot of people will be understanding when you admit your mistakes, and being honest like that is something that's really admirable. In the end even if you try that and it doesn't workout sometimes we have to take steps towards being responsible and doing what's best for us. It's your first job and from here on out it will be your responsibility to maintain a positive work record for when you're hired in the future. I'm not your parents, but you obviously care a lot about your family and I don't think you're a disappointment at all. I'm really proud of you and I know that today was hard and things are going to get better.

Show them how you and your spouse can disagree and talk it out without yelling and name calling. I never saw my parents argue, they always went to their room and turned on music so we couldn't hear and so relationships were a struggle as a teen. And don't ""Guilt Trip"", Gawd I hated that. 

Talk it out, explain why it was wrong, praise them for taking ownership and make them come up with a solution/consequence (within reason) and forgive. You're going to fuck up as a parent, they're forced to forgive you, at least to your face. So apologise and set the example. I apologise for raising my voice or wrongly accusing or whatever.

 If your child doesn't feel secure enough to tell you their deepest secrets and emotions and sexual orientation, you've absolutely failed as a parent. Take at least a few hours on a particular day of the week to just talk. Ask if they have any life questions. 

Teach them while they're young that asking questions is the only way to learn. Don't let them rely on google! I taught my daughter at 5 years old what a period is and pregnancy and birth in a simple manner without freaking her out. Simply because she asked about blood on the toilet rim that I didn't see. Obviously I did not talk about conception. Seriously! I didn't understand periods until I had mine. 

You're their 1st teacher and they should trust you the most. Find a way to plant some knowledge without overwhelming them in a way they can understand. They're going to learn about it eventually, don't let them find out the wrong way. If you don't feel comfortable, tough shit. You knew this day would come eventually.

Childhood is where we learn coping skills, trust, relationship building, proper etiquette, life skills, ect. It's our job to get them ""Adult Ready"". They only get one childhood. Don't fuck it up! 

Your upraising has a huge role in making the person you grow up to be. Either you follow the footsteps with some changes, or do the opposite.

This is a very helpful and important post. Thank you for sharing it. I would like to add one point which, in both my professional and personal experience, is rather important. 

There are two forms of suicidality - active and passive. Active is the presence of intention (plan, means, and timeline), while passive is all of the above points, only without actual intention to go through with it. It may sound like, ""I don't want to kill myself, but I just wish I was dead, or did not exist.""

When you hear or see anything that matches the description above, it is important to figure out whether the person is active or passive in their suicidality, as that will determine the urgency of the situation and thus, how to respond. 

Below is a link to a great personal reflection written by someone who was, and remains, passively suicidal. It is still a serious situation, but needn't necessarily be addressed in the same way as active suicidality.

You can get help with this and I highly recommend you do so with a counselor or therapist. Just because you go see one, it doesn’t mean you will have to take medication. Psychiatrists are usually the ones who prescribe. Regardless, go talk to someone and go cry about these experiences with someone in a safe place. You’re strong, you’re amazing, you’re helpful and you deserve a break.

But I’d be very serious and deliberate about it.  I would sit them both down (if they live together) and just explain to them in no uncertain terms that you’ve been feeling majorly depressed and need to see a therapist to ensure you don’t do anything to harm yourself.  But the second reason it’s hard is that your parents, if they are like mine, will probably answer with, “you’re not depressed.”  And I think parents mean well when they say this—they just don’t want to believe that it’s possible the child they love so much is suffering from depression.

With that in mind, not diagnosing, I looked it up for you.

Мой друг вырос в ужасной семье, где над ним издевались, и в полной бедности. Он сохранил денег на билет в Ирландию, где он работал как чернорабочий, но зарплата была больше чем в его стране. Он накопил достаточно денег и переехал в Канаду, где работал на другой плохой работе, но через несколько лет, он стал гражданином Канады и нашёл работу мечты, и ему сейчас в разы лучше.

Ты в ужасной ситуации, мне жаль и я ненавижу гомофобов и трансфобов в России. Но не всё потеряно. Продолжай искать работу. Рано или поздно, кто-нибудь тебя точно наймёт. После этого, постарайся сохранить как можно больше денег. Со временем, ты сможешь переехать в другой город. Посмотри возможность работать за границей, где-нибудь в Европе, даже как временный рабочий, - это поможет заработать и сохранить ещё больше денег. Чем больше у тебя денег, тем больше у тебя свободы - даже появится возможность переехать в другую страну на совсем. Здесь в Канаде люди более толерантые, принимающие и доброжелательные.

Translation just in case:

I'm Russian and haven't lived in Russia for a while. Look, it is not hopeless yet. My friend grew up in a really abusive family and a poor country. He saved enough money to first go and work in Ireland, it was a shitty job, but it paid more than anything in his country. He then saved enough to move to Canada and work another shitty job, but after a few years, he's now working he's now a Canadian citizen, working at his dream job and is finally in a good place mentally.

The situation is bad around you, and I feel so sorry you're experiencing this. I hate Russia and this homophobia and transphobia in the society. But it is not hopeless. You should keep looking for a job. It's not true that nobody will hire you - somebody eventually will. When you get a job, save as much money as you can! Eventually, you might have to move to a bigger city. I really recommend trying to find work abroad, somewhere in Europe, even as a temporary worker - this way you earn and save more money than in Russia. You will have more options once you have more money - you can move to another country altogether.

Be kind to yourself during the burnout time, the depth of the episode, because it’ll end. Plus, if you had a choice you would have never wished that on yourself. When I remind myself its a funk that will end, it helps me out of it faster, like a flare up of an allergy. Obviously we all have very different experiences, but through seeing it like an episode I can make shorter with decisions that care for myself, the shorter they tend to be. I’m sure part of it is probably in my head since I’m paying close mine to the start and stop of said episodes but it does definitely work when I start looking at it. You know that you will always bounce back eventually, and if you keep that on the forefront of your brain, it becomes almost like the light at the end of the tunnel you are waiting to see. If you have a close person in your life you can confide in about these things, I always found it very useful to tell the person closest to me that I am going through a hard time right now and I might not come out much. I just feel empty and I don’t know how long I’m going to feel that way. Sometimes that just means people know who are close to me so they know why I don’t want to leave my bed. So by looking at it with a different mindset, trying to create a support system, and having enough self reflection to know when things are starting to get bad, I sort of mitigate some of the bad during the bad episodes.

It must obviously be that my brain is too messed up to properly express whats wrong and this guy is at a loss on where to help, right? I mean how many therapists do I have to see to be convinced that I'm not meeting them half way? 

So I would lead with the worst things about me that people would expect never to hear until years of therapy later--- and I think that makes me a liar. They must assume I'm just saying anything because the topic leads into absolutely nothing. Of course they can't say to my face 'I don't believe you' because that could trigger me and I might freak out I guess.

But again, I have to take the blame because something like -- I know I like to get pissed on because I feel equal to the waste that goes in the toilet because my dad treated me like a burden/inconvenience/afterthought and the toilet got more attention than me. -- And its just like ""...mkay and why do you think your dad treated you that way?"" cause hes undisciplined and self loathing, never wanted kids, and regrets the obligation of having them. ""...mkay and how is your relationship with him today?"" yea we don't speak to each other, there's too much conflict and we're both too stubborn to let the one forgive the other without finding a new reason to be mad at each other. I was the last one to make contact with him and frankly I'm perfectly OK with never talking to him again. ""...mmmmmmkay well let's practice something let's give you an assignment for next week, write your dad a letter/call your dad."" Yea dude I've been trying that type of stuff with several other therapists for years and it does not result in the way you think it will, please trust me; this will cause a psychotic episode if I try to write my dad another silly letter about my feelings that he won't read. ""...I can only help if you take my suggestions.""   LOL PEACE OUT GIRL SCOUT.     
I had a therapist look at me and starts talking about another patient with schizophrenia and I walk out of that session worried I've just been subtly told I might be schizophrenic. Yet another unconfirmed diagnosis, like how was I supposed to get anything out of that conversation? You could argue he never said the words 'you have this' but for real man, this was last session I did with this particular therapist and I never listened better to make sure I wasn't missing something this whole time, and I walk away with ""That sounds like whats going on with another patient of mine.""  LOL Thanks Doc, Bye.

Hey did you know that certain organizations you sign up to have no obligation to tell you that your therapist might be a student intern logging hours for school? I did not know that until last year.   
Perhaps too... A lot of the initial stages of therapy are basic. There is some strange fear carried in the industry that If shit gets too real we'll do something to harm ourselves - so its always like this empty fluffy toddler cartoon optimism politely asking you to feel better and love yourself. They seem to forget that 70 years ago was a very different time, and people can be open about themselves without much damage - The damage comes from staying silent about our worst moments day to day, from waiting around for our therapists to ask about the 'hard stuff'.  

There's no good protecting us from our illness anymore because those practices would serve solely to maintain that good ol' ""Happy House Wife/Hard Working Husband/Happy to be an American"" attitude. Those veils have to be torn open. But because mental treatment had its foundation in oppression, were still climbing out of the hole. 

All I could say is don't wait for the therapist to prompt you into expressing the bad stuff. I don't think they're always allowed to press you, especially if you are not being combative and especially if you are a new client.

Honestly I have no better therapy than the time I give to myself, than the things I did to find what helps me survive day to day. It took a long time to know the difference between the the healthy things I wanted and the unhealthy things I wanted. Like socializing? Yea man I've never been encouraged to do something more and I never end up regretting it more, because its not a solution to mental illness. 

It's just not for me man, and If there comes a day where I can honestly say ""I'm not happier for being a loner"" I will gladly take steps to change that. Its not about comfort zones or accepting others or getting out more - its about the visceral reactions I have to social situations of any and all kinds- reactions that I cant control with all available maintenance, short of complete inebriation. 

I could go on and on so I'm gonna try and conclude this - Over time you will learn what works directly towards an improved daily experience. If your illness is chronic, than talking about the past and what goes on in your mind will lead to nothing. The best I could get from a therapist today is helping me to maintain the practices I have found to be beneficial. It's a waste of time for me to get them to understand. 

Lastly, there are ways to express the worst things without risking a trip to your local hospitals respective psych wing. When speaking about self harm one can reassure their doctor that they are ideas, and not plans of action. I was able to speak quite openly with a particular therapist about my worst more violent thoughts and he trusted that they were thoughts and and I believe a big reason why they still remain only thoughts is because I gave myself a loophole to talk about it without feeling like there was a limit to what I could safely say without being torn away from my life for a week.",,,1589892041,{},fr4ma0d,False,t3_gmkjgw,False,True,t3_gmkjgw,/r/mentalhealth/comments/gmkjgw/why_are_therapists_like_this/fr4ma0d/,1589892043,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,0,[],,,

My opinion on this is that technology is good however when used responsibly: both for education and entertainment purposes, however porn exposure should be avoided (IMO), especially in young kids who have no idea what real sex is like and more than likely develop some sort of misconception about what it is. 

I never had any sex talk with my mom or dad in my younger years and I kinda wish I did... not around the age of 9 but definitely around the age of 13/14, I know for some it may even feel kind of awkward to talk about it with your kid however I wouldn't avoid the subject as sex is part of who we are as humans and it's natural so there's nothing to be awkward about, the kid may feel strange talking about this with their parents but later on I'm sure they'll understand it and appreciate it.

In sum: I'm all for allowing kids to use tablets, play with them, learn more about technology etc, but I'm also of the opinion that us (as adults) should limit their exposure to things they're not supposed to experience until later in their life, in a way, childhood and our teenage years will define in a way who we are, where we're headed to in life and we best be ""human"" during those years.

You, as well as everyone, has had to be faced with sudden changes on your lifestyle and have been limited to where you can go and how much you can leave your house.

It won't be your fault - these things have a clear genetic component. Think about it this way - it's something you always had, but the symptoms are now showing up.

I've written before about going to a psychiatrist, so you could check out [the page on my website that talks about that](https://www.livingmanicdepressive.com/diagnosis-doctors/3-first-time-visiting-a-psych).

If necessary, ask one of your friends to help you through the process of finding a psychiatrist and and coming with you when you go to doctor. Support from someone else helps a lot!  Depending on the situation, you may or may not have to tell your mom you are visiting a psychiatrist / counsellor.

I'm not sure of the situation with your mom, but as long as it is not actively hostile, you should talk with your mother sooner rather than later. No, it's not going to be an easy conversation but it would need to get done.

You might one to start off with something like ""I know my grades have been getting worse, but I think it's because I've been (having mood swings / getting depression). I don't feel well at all, and I'd like to go to a doctor to check it out""  Again, if one of your friends is with you while you have this conversation with your mom, that's not a bad thing. But you know your mom, so do what seems appropriate.

I know you say your mom has problems, but she's your mom - after she gets over the initial surprise (and associated emotion), I'm hoping she'll support you. It especially matters if you are under legal age, because there are some things only your parent / guardian can do.

Lots of information here. You don't have to rush and do it all in the next few days, but it could guide how you act in the next month or so.

All of his music is very open in discussing his own internal problems. I've heard a lot of people who struggle with varying mental disorders, such as OCD, as well as those that don't, that he is a great inspiration to them, because he's relatable. I know music is in of itself is not the key, but finding someone who really, genuinely understands where you are coming from may just be your hope. Two other songs of his I'd recommend are ""The Search"" ---&gt;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnlJw9H0xAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnlJw9H0xAM)  and ""Why"" ---&gt;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuJV-DAv\_wE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuJV-DAv_wE) .

THIS. I'll never understand. How is that a thing people do ? WHY ?! It happened to me so many times in the past and everytime, I was extremely confused. I opened up and ended up leaving the conversation with my problems untouched and for some reason ... I have more of them now ? And they're not even mine ??? How can I resolve them ? I'm 8.
Let's say, for the sake of the argument, that the suicide notes you find in your child's bedroom aren't really that serious. ( Unlikely but, whatevs... ) Isn't that your job as a parent to at least check on them ? Get them to talk without interrupting ? Validate their feelings ? Idk, not judge them ? 
How can you INSTEAD, deny their child the attention they clearly need so that YOU can have it. And to make things worst, you add your problems to you child's pile and threaten them with shame if they don't validate them ? HOW IS THIS CALLED LOVE ? It's... Beyond me.
I can't wait to meet my child but when I see how frequent this shit happens, it makes me hesitate.

Get rid of it. 

If you don’t use it all the time put it in storage if you cant get rid of it.

You don’t own things - things own you.

This works please believe me I’ve done it myself and helped many other people

Start with one section of your work desk- this is a game. Nothing more. You do not have to change your life your change your habits purposefully. This is a game. 

Buy disinfectant wipes. 
Now pick one section of your work desk. Let’s say the upper left quadrant. If you’re feeling ornery you can pick whatever quadrant you want instead. Your choice. 

Clean that section off-  take everything off of that quad. 

Wipe it to clean the surface. 

Now inventory what you got. 
If you use it frequently you can keep it there. First is that the best place for it? If it is -wipe it down put it back. 

- throw away anything that’s junk 
- give away anything someone else might want 
- put anything you’re not sure about in a box. 

Now if you want to you can move onto another quadrant today or you can do it tomorrow. 

Then you just keep doing it - little bites of the elephant. 

Same thing move everything from the desired spot 

wipe it down 

put stuff back if you use it all the time and clean it first.

Digital technologies as they are currently designed are largely to be corporate driven, and social media technologies are created to be literally as addictive as possible and are really created for the purposes of data mining and creating personalized advertising. There was a good quote, ""“**If you** are not paying for it, **you**'re not the customer; **you**'re the **product** being sold"" by O'Reilly. I think this holds a lot of truth in terms of companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Snap, dating apps, etc. 

We are in a toxic society. No one is to blame for feeling depressed or anxious; I think these should be conceived as societal ills rather than individual ills; we live in a toxic, disconnected society, where products, property, and companies, are valued over living individuals and the environment. I think it relates to why our society is falling apart right now in this time of late-stage capitalism and global pandemic. So yes, your feelings are valid, and I hope you are able to be gentle with yourself accordingly; we are all just living through an extraordinarily toxic time that I think is the culmination of decades, even centuries, of this toxic, disconnected patriarchal, industrialized culture.

It sounds like she is projecting probably what was told to her growing up that kids should be happy and not complain. Everyone goes through times of depression and anxiety (statistically 2/3 of the population is prone to these states apparently). Further, \*being groomed as a child is NEVER the child's fault.\* That is just so sick and sad that she would say that. My hear breaks for you. 

You are not dumb or dramatic, you are a child who is learning as best as you can and doing as best as you can in what sounds like clearly toxic circumstances. Yes, anything you feel is valid. Your mom should not make you question the validity of your feelings or perspective. She clearly has her own issues she is battling with and is negating her own responsibility. 

I hope that you find the strength to survive and overcome this situation as I've found from my own experiences having survived a traumatic childhood that being well is the best revenge. Healing is not easy or a linear process but it is possible. I hope you are able to get support and learn not to take the behaviors or attitude of your mom personally (I am a 40-year-old adult and talking with my mom or communicating with her in any form can still be so triggering, but I've long since learned not to take it personally and she is dealing with her own traumas and mental illness.)

I hope regardless that you seek and find healing and know that your life and situation can change for the better. We can't undo the pain that has happened to us, but our bodies and minds are capable of processing and healing from trauma, and it is really empowering to break free from one's toxic past, which I hope you are able to do, even if it may be a belabored process.

Studying Psychology is like studying the reality that we try to ignore. Nothing offends someone like the truth. I try to help people on here, and I also know that the truth hurts, someone else.

You know she is bad for you? I hope you know that you don't have to become someone you're not to get attention from someone you shouldn't. I know you want her, I know she talks to you, and you value her, I know that you need a person in your life, and things would get better. But I think that real health doesn't come from outside yourself, I just wouldn't bet on someone else coming into my life and meeting my very specific needs. It's possible, I guess. Life is hard enough, don't go against yourself.

How can we improve? Slowly. I have racing thoughts, I practice pausing before reacting. I try to take in all the information before I react out of anger. As I am often wrong when reacting so quickly. Why do we get angry? Usually when other people are angry, and who isn't angry right now? I honestly don't know anyone who is doing well, or is even trying to. So what does self care look like? Here are the basics,  Sleep better, slowly Workout more, Eat better, and Clean. That, staying sober, and creating art, saved my life. I turned things around, I just started to learn, and I slowly improved over time. Sticking to that list will also improve sleep, I hope you can begin to sleep better.

How do you communicate? That's been my life's work. I went from shaking around women, and now I can talk to beautiful women. I learned the hard way, but I forced myself to learn. I became a stand up comedian, and I work in customer service. I made sure that I was practicing talking to people everyday. People are really bad at communicating. There is no guarantee that someone will stay in our lives. Only the people who are able to connect with others will form relationships. I am actually writing a book on this. I just hate reading my old work, so I haven't edited it yet.

As a Cashier, I was able to talk to anywhere from 600 to 2,000 people a day, depending on the shift. If you are unsure of something, as a cashier, you can test it out immediately, and a several hundred times. It's not a great job, but it's great practice. I also did standup and karaoke. It's tough at first, it feels awkward, so I just kept doing it.

But I know that's wrong and I struggle all the time to remind myself that I'm a whole adult with my own thoughts now and I'm very capable of changing how I live at any moment. 

But people grow and have experiences different from you. They live based off their experiences and teach based off their fears or worries. It may not always be healthy or the correct way. Those ways could have a lot of repercussions to those being taught by fear.

It shapes and molds personalities, but we too also shape and mold ourselves anew each day. I'm also riddled with anxiety and depression. But now that this has been passed down to me, what am I to do with it? Sometimes, I'm able to put it down. And rest. And care for myself. Some days it's a shadow, quietly waving at me to come embrace it. And still other days, it's an entire wildcat sitting on my chest. Watching me and waiting for me to mess up so it can tear at my mental health.


I look at my parents and how they grew up, and how they learned to cope and live and ignore and dissociate, and I understand that not all are strong enough to acknowledge their depression or anxiety and work to live with it.

I felt trapped, like I'd never be able to escape this haunting feeling.

I personally chose EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) therapy, but there are other alternatives, too. It took months because first I had to learn coping skills so that when we got to actually talking about the trauma, I'd be able to handle it. It was hard because healing meant going back to that moment and reliving it, but I had my therapist and my coping skills with me this time.

It is not an objective reality. What might be seen as the height of beauty in one culture during on time period could be seen as the height of ugly in that same culture 40 years ago, or be seen as the height of ugly in a different culture that exists at the exact same time.

You can also learn to find new things attractive/unattractive based on your exposure to those things being portrayed in a positive or negative light.   
I don't know if you have BDD. But you aren't ugly because ugly doesn't objectively exist and what is seen as ugly or not is variable. No one can tell you if you are 'just ugly' because you are going to get different answers from different people depending on who they are, where they live, etc.  You may just choose to ignore when people say you're beautiful because you can't see it yourself and therefore believe they're just being nice. You'll believe people if they tell you you're ugly because you already believe it to be true. It's confirmation bias. 

  
If you feel you have BDD, it might help to talk to a therapist about it.  But if you really want the truth, there it all is. You can not be  objectively ugly -or beautiful- because it is a construct.  Constructs have their value, but they also have limits.",,,1593559037,{},fwj1g7s,False,t3_hir2n2,False,True,t3_hir2n2,/r/mentalhealth/comments/hir2n2/how_do_i_know_if_i_have_bdd_or_im_just_ugly/fwj1g7s/,1593564465,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,0,[],,,

Definitely reach out to the GP! You’re not wasting anyone’s time. As another commenter mentions, therapy is great overall. It helps to talk to someone other than friends/family, even if one is a mentally healthy person.

I know you may be reluctant to get CPS involved, and I don't 100% know if this would require them to call CPS or not. It's possible that it won't, and that you could then at least  get him some more support in school when he's there. Maybe they'd be able to help him make friends by being more encouraging, even.

  
Also I don't know if this will be possible, but could you leave little notes of encouragement for him? It doesn't require a conversation, you can write them when you actually have mental energy/fortitude in the day to do so, and it might help him brighten his day a little bit. Things like that you are proud of him, that he's a good kid, things he isn't hearing from his mother.  

 I know he is only 5 so maybe this one wouldn't be great, but could you get him a little journal for him to write in? I think it'd be really good for him to be able to sort through his thoughts and feelings. Get him, like, a fun pen too to help encourage him to write. Maybe one of those pens that have different colors in them. Art could also be a helpful outlet. Some really cheap colored pencils and a sketchpad to help encourage him to work through his feelings through productive means like that. Both of these suggestions would cost you money, so I understand if they aren't doable for that reason, either. Maybe you could even ask him to draw something for you. I think kids really enjoy feeling useful and making others happy, so it might be a good confidence boost to ask him to draw you something and then giving him some honest but positive feedback. Things such as ""Wow, I can tell you put a lot of effort into this!"" or ""I like your color choice! Bold!"". I don't think it would require a whole lot of interaction between you two, and it could allow him to feel like he has a 'place' in the home.

3. Try to self-monitor and get help when you need it. This can be a difficult one. Asking for help is difficult, and accepting it can be even harder.  
4. Try to stay away from or limit alcohol and drug use, usually good to keep your doctor informed of use as well.

I don't think you have to say sorry. You have to be more direct with him but not in his way, not aggressively. Tell him he's wrong in a calm manner. You have to be strategical for him to understand.

Haha i think he's a narcissist. He broke you a bit. You can't seem to think clearly, you think only of those situations where he made you feel small and unimportant. But that's not the point he was trying to convey. He just wanted to say i don't understand any of those people and it's making me frustrated, i want to rip someones head because of the frustration. 

I think you don't have to do anything special, like the intervention. Pff, i think he will flip out because of that one. Best is to not do anything that could seem like he's done something wrong.

I have been treated like shit my whole life and I'm 14 right now, close to be 15. It's sad that we young people have to suffer through a lot, to get in a specific point in life. If it's either death or the most blissful life you could've ever wished for. I have been abused by my parents my whole life, stabbed, locked up, kicked. You name it. I was completely hid from the world, my parents would never let me go outside, go to school or whatever. It's like I was treated like a homeless person, In my own home. Later, I fought back. Hurt my parents and ran away. Of course, I didn't know where I was going, because I never go outside. I was seriously locked out from the world. All of these emotions you are feeling are normal, I still hurt myself today because I think I deserve it. I still slit my wrist everyday hoping that I would one day just fall asleep and never wake up again. But it will do nothing good, and nor will it with you. I sought for help I tried looking for anyone to help me. But no one did. It's like no one could see the clown on the street trying to gain attention. And I was the clown. No one could see me. I was talking to people and they gave me a disgusted look and ran off. That's the world I was living in. A total homeless. I'm so sorry you had to go through all of that, and I personally don't know what it is to love, because. I have never had anyone who loves me either. But I still try to help people like you, even when our situations were totally different, I could still relate. I always try to help, even if I know I can't. Love is just a bug in the human brain, it only gives hatred, sadness and anger. People leaving you like that, like you are worth nothing. Or NEVER WERE worth ANYTHING. That's what Love is. Don't get yourself involved in that mess, and only care about the people you want to care about. I personally don't have anyone to care of, because I don't have anyone to help me with my own issues. I am still suicidal, I still try to help people. But I am still waiting for the day of someone who cares about me standing right before me. That gives me a reason to stay alive. And protect that person till the day I step foot outside this world. You should do the same, It is pointless to look at the worst things in life, especially since you are in an age of puberty, you automatically think stuff like that. There is nothing wrong with it. But please know that whatever you're going through, do your best to seek help. Proffesionals or people on the street. It doesn't matter. Whatever you do. My DM's are always open if you need someone to talk to. I'm sorry if I didn't get much of it, or my message was completely pointless.

If the friend is not close, then it may be time to reevaluate whether that person is truly your friend if they are passing such judgment against you even when knowing your full story.


It can be dangerous to have ""friends"" that gas light you when you live with mental illness. Friends should support you in your recovery and your mourning through your adjustment period.


What you are doing is completely normal.  It is no different from a person listening to recordings left behind by a loved family member after they have passed on.

Also covid19 is not classified as a HCID (high consequence infections disease). So it is highly unlikely to kill ppl that r healthy enough to protest.

Do things for you, things that make you happy, and not things you do to make others happy.

read other stories on Reddit (check out some other subs you don't usually read)

Have you ever been curious about a topic, but never had time to research it; do it now, Google is your friend!

Look up a beginners online course for a language you've always been curious about; learn a few phrases

if you are in an apartment with a balcony, (away from others), spend a bit of time on the balcony getting some fresh air, read a book, or magazine, or just sit and watch the clouds or do some deep breathing

\*\*\*\*\*---go for a walk outside only ***IF*** your area is allowing that; practise social distancing and go to a more isolated area if possible; if it is not allowed where you live, follow the appropriate rules.

Here are some relaxation techniques you can check out, too, to see which ones might work for you------

**Relaxation techniques**\----

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there. [https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-practice-progressive-muscle-relaxation-3024400](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-practice-progressive-muscle-relaxation-3024400)
3. **Guided imagery**. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes
4. **Mindfulness meditation**. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future.

Truly, you should be proud of yourself. Think about this: despite your back pain, despite how horrible you felt on THIS day, you stood at the bell. Even though it felt impossible, you got up, you went through the motions, and you tried today. I'm proud of you.

But do you know what's even better? The ending. The fact that you realize that you need to change; now THAT'S where it resonates. That's the concept that will start to change you. The guilt you feel knowing that you could have done better is there to HELP YOU change. Listen to it, but don't hold onto it. There's no need. Accept that you have the potential to feel happy, to live with good health, and to be satisfied when your head hits the pillow. It will happen.

You know what to do, and you know it will be difficult. But the reason you feel this way is because you deserve better. I'm so sorry that you have to deal with back pain, and I can't imagine the difficulty that comes from the pain meds. I do know just like so many others that you can get through this, and it sounds like you know it too. Just take that first baby step, whatever it may be. A day without alcohol, a nice mile jog, a walk, eating clean for a meal, whatever. Get after it.

Trust me, we all like easy things, and yes, life can be dreadfully hard sometimes. But the harder you try at the beginning with those little victories, the easier the routine gets, the happier you become.   


I know it doesn't feel like it, but if you sublimate the pain you felt today and use it make tomorrow better, then today was a victory.

Something that's helped me a lot is aiming for self neutrality instead of love. I try my best to think of myself as an average person. Not perfect, not outstanding, just an average person who makes mistakes but isn't horrible. You probably wouldn't hate an average person for no reason and think that every single thing they do is wrong. You're probably more likely to just accept that they make mistakes and are imperfect as all humans are, but you won't lsnt wish any horrible fate upon them. If you can start thinking of yourself as an average person, it's easier to let go of some of the hate. As you let go of the hate, it's easier to view yourself neutrally with a less subjective lens. Personally, I feel like learning neutrality hasn't helped me fall in love with myself, but it's helped me respect myself more. Maybe one day I'll love myself, but for now just respecting and feeling neutrally about myself has improved my confidence, self esteem, and happiness significantly. 

Seeing a therapist who you trust is also going to be very helpful, but you're not going to see much success in therapy unless you believe that you're worth the effort of change. If you can get yourself to believe that you don't deserve all of the hate you've been giving yourself (which does NOT require admitting perfection), you can go a long way.

It's not okay to blame the world so that you don't have to better yourself. There are extremes and there is balance. If you only balme yourself you cannot grow, if you only blame the world you cannot grow. You are already introspective and have the ability to look within, overtime I hope you will be able to look at yourself through a psotive lens like I do instead of the negative one. What's left is a strong individual who is able to recognize their own faults as well as not letting the crushing wrongness of the world destroy who you are. 

&gt;I hope It will be different, but everyting turns out to be worse than I sometimes expect, and it keeps killing my hope

I know what it's like. Whens everything goes wrong, it's crushing and debilitating. You are stuck and it seems like there nowhere to go. The power of hope is that it's light doesn't die out. You still have hope, but it hurts bc hope has let you down. 

&gt;Either work as hard as i can on myself and constantly feel like shit OR live in denial and feel like shit only sometimes. Im trying, I still have hope, but ""we cannot fight our nature"", and that makes my hope go away. I think this discussion can be ended, there's not much words can do.

Your nature isn't as damning as u think, my entire family on both sides are alcoholics. My grandfather died of drug OD in the hospital after leaving being allowed to leave bc he was so spiteful of help. But that's not my nature, I chose to fight what I could. I still indulge in substances yes, but I've been able to reach balance in my life I'm not afraid of. You cannot fight your nature no, but your nature isn't being your parents. Your nature is learning from what your parents and the owlrd has taught you to be better than those before you.

I dont want a special treatment, I just want more people to understand I cant always feel empathy, i cant always find joy (even in things i like), i cant always be the person they think I am, and its fucking sad.

You are wise beyond your age bud, you're right. But this isn't your problem. It is the problem with people. It is not your fault people are ignorant and stupid, don't take that burden onto yourself please. I made and still make that mistake. People will always be selfish. People will always be ignorant and rude and not understanding anf just saddening. But not all of us are like that. Don't give up hope that people will understand. I understand. I relate so much to what you say. I just want some appreciation, someone to acknowledge how hard I work and how much struggle I have to go through to be who I am. But what I realized was I didn't need the affirmation from others. It didn't matter how much people praised me or understood. I needed the affirmation from myself. Its okay I'm not always nice or happy or in a good mood. You CANNOT Blame YOURSELF FOR OTHERS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING and please please don't. It is an impossible burden to carry. It is not your fault people are stupid. You cannot change everyone. If there's one person in my entire life that I have a positive impact on and make happier than my life is worth all the pain and hardship. Appreciate your struggle, don't blame it. Remember bro, ur young. Im by no means old but there are so many years in your timeline.. Don't convince urself u will be alone now. Accept that maybe ur alone now, but it won't always be like that. 


&gt;The only point of everything I do is to delay the suicide that im sure i will someday commit.

I can't express to you how sad this makes me, :( I must implore you to fight this belief as hard as you can. Everytime this thought pops up, crush it, kill it. Tell it it's stupid and that you're stupid for thinking it. Your destiny isn't set in stone. I'm not gonna say ""oohohahaoo u can't have suicidal thoughts hurdur"" but don't believe your present mindset will be your future one pls. When ur suicidal all you think of is that. Part of overcoming that is realizing you won't always have these feelings. I get it tho dude, it's so so hard to get out of it. It takes time. A lot of time. You must recondition yourself, you must slowly learn to love yourself again to make progress. And progress means anything, progress one day can be feeling super energized and having a good day with ur parents. Progress another day can be not killing yourself during a complete break down. The journey to recovery is hard, maybe even harder than the issues in the first place. You must start somewhere. I want you to live bro fr. That may sound silly bc I'm some internet bozo but idc. Ik there's a human with flesh and blood, the same as me, feeling the same as I do behind there. I don't want you to die. I want you to be happy. Happier than last time. You don't need to be perfectly mentally healthy in 2 minutes. Appreciate yourself, deny your negativity. Add ""now"" to all ur mindsets, ""the only point of what you do NOW is to not commit suicide"" ""I am completely alone NOW"". The future is full of anything that could happen, good or bad, if you convive urself it will always be bad, then it will. Our brains are powerful, in facts they are the most powerful thing in existence, if we didn't have them we wouldn't exist. Accept the pain now, accept that pain MAY happen but will not always be the biggest factor in your life.

Im not running from my issues I'm doing something I love"" was I able to start finding my passion again. Let yourself love, let yourself find joy in things, it's okay if they aren't huge world changing projects. Bc as long as you have that thought, that what your doing is just a distraction from the darkness, the darkness will always find a way back. Take the feeling of joy you find with plants, really let yourself be enveloped by it. Get into it. That feeling is the same whether it's ""just a hobby"" or a life long passion. You are doing something you love, not to escape, but because you are still motivated despite your circumstances, whether u realize it or not.",,,1590609095,{},fs0g9tl,False,t3_grodwt,False,True,t1_fs0e1y8,/r/mentalhealth/comments/grodwt/how_to_live_with_your_genes_fcking_you_basicaly_a/fs0g9tl/,1590615164,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,0,[],,1590609818.0,

You haven't said if you're being abused, or if there's real danger in the house. ***Assuming there isn't...***

There are no stress-free answers, and it's your parents who've made it that way. So you'll probably have to do things that feel drastic. If there's an extended family member or friend of the family you have a halfway decent relationship with, walk freely through the house on the phone with them and let your parents hear you talking about how you're morbidly depressed and they won't help. Heck, call the national suicide hotline. Those people will talk with you as many times as you like, and you can open up, vent, and let it all out. And if it would help, you can stroll right by mom on the couch as you do it.

Involving your school counselor or any teacher you halfway trust isn't bad.

You can call 911 and tell them you're morbidly depressed, having suicidal thoughts, and don't trust yourself. Tell them your parents are unwilling to help or take you to someone. If they tell you to put mom on the phone, that might be a wakeup call. If you tell them it's not safe to involve your parents, they'll send cops over to take you to a professional to be assessed. Your parents finding cops at their door is usually a wakeup call, especially if the neighbors are watching. Social services might wind up getting involved if your parents are refusing care for a suicidal teen.

Anyone can go to a hospital or their doctor and admit they're having severe depression, suicidal thoughts, and don't feel safe, and wheels will start turning.

Most counties/metro areas have a mental health resource line. Call them and ask them what resources they have.

You can do a local search for Teen Support Groups, and communicate with the counselor who facilitates the group. Sometimes they know how to address these situations.

Learning new skills is challenging, rewarding, and makes you a more desirable candidate for new job positions. The ladies also appreciate a good education and a man who cares for his body, so you’ll be doing yourself a favor in that domain.

The only other thing I would add is to try and find inexpensive hobbies, especially if they hone a skill or lead to some sort of product. This could be as simple as wood-working or gardening. Just as an example, I like to arrange music, and I use a free web-based platform. I also like to play board games, tend to potted plants, and play D&amp;D. Board games can be a bit pricey, but they’re single investments for years of entertainment. Think of all the money you used to spend on drugs, maybe $50/wk or whatever. Take that money, save it, and set some personal or professional goals for yourself. When you meet those goals, spend some of that money on yourself toward one of your preferred hobbies. It motivates you to pursue goals, you save money, and it’s rewarding yourself with hobbies that build skills and help you feel better about yourself over time.

I was feeling this way &amp; it’s been getting progressively worse, so much so that a couple months ago I took myself to the doctor &amp; got diagnosed with anxiety &amp; depression. I’ll share what I’ve learned these last few months as it may be helpful to you. 

Thing is, I truly did not believe I had anything wrong with me. I thought I was just unmotivated, fatigued, lazy, whatever it was that day, &amp; didn’t think I had any severe mental problems. But I took the depression &amp; anxiety tests my dr gave me (for me, it was a questionnaire where you rate different statements 1-4, such as “I feel lonely a lot of the time”) &amp; scored a 72/100, which put me in the severe range, only 3 away from extreme. That was a wake up call for me that not only was I depressed, but it was bad. 

What I didn’t realize was how heavily my thought process had been fucked up. It’s so hard to tell because it’s literally just how you think. You’re in control of your thoughts right? That’s what I thought, until I got on medication &amp; started to improve. I realized that I had been experiencing very negative thought processes that seemed truer than true in my head; feelings of apathy, nobody caring, having no motivation because what’s the point in anything, etc. Those were my default thoughts &amp; I could never convince myself that there was anything worth being happy over. Point is, depression is a chemical imbalance in your brain that literally screws with your perception. As such, I was worse off than I thought, &amp; the same may be true for you. 

After a few months on meds I’ve seen a definite
improvement. If nothing else, I have less negative thoughts &amp; more motivation. I’m still sad a fair amount &amp; I’m still lonely at times, &amp; it’s a work in progress - I’m getting put on more meds to help with that. But, I’m getting better. I can spot the negative thoughts now &amp; do my best to kick them out. It’s a definite improvement. 

I would encourage you to talk to your doctor about getting on meds!

You might think you attached yourself or wormed your way in there, but chances are you’re an amazing person and they can totally see that and are also thrilled to have you join their group! When I’m not too comfortable with friends yet, I also find it hard being the one who initiates plans. I find it easier to do this when we’re already talking, so I’ll start a conversation or reply to one of their posts and then hit them with “we should catch up soon!”. They might respond asking when you’re free, or even if they just sound enthusiastic you can ask when they’re free next. Remind yourself that the worst they can do is probably say that they aren’t free for a while or not reply.

With that in mind. Seek help, therapy to many seems like a cowards way and sadly I truly wish I took it when I needed it. But if you know it’s dark, sometimes venting about it and finding the source will help. 

Talking has helped many and considering you vented and somewhat asked for advice this means deep down some part knows/wishes there’s a way out of this hell.

The first time we went to see my parents (about 1-2 months into the relationship), she didn’t want to be “left alone” as I would often just go randomly sit and chat with my dad or randomly walk around into a different room, etc.  I understood that, especially for the first visit with someone else’s parents and being in a town/house, where she didn’t feel at home, it’s got to be weird and awkward... but this behavior has continued even to this day.  Despite multiple visits now, both to my parents and my parents coming to visit, she still reminds me prior to not “leaver her alone.”   I’m starting to actually think a lot about this now as I’m typing and will possibly bring it up to my own therapist to seek guidance on how best to approach.  It’s certainly another, I don’t want to say descriptor or check mark, but it definitely serves to give meaning to some of those behaviors.

[],,oODillyOo,,,[],,,,text,t2_4cantx6c,False,False,[],"Sorry to hear you are having such a rough time right now.  I realize that the current 'health crisis issue' going on in the world may be having quite an impact on people right now.  So do you think that isolating/quarantining/lower socialization, etc could be impacting you more than you might have thought?  Or besides that, (or on top of that), is there anything you can think of in the past month or two that may have occurred for you that can have contributed to your increase in symptoms?  Not that I can diagnose you or anything, but maybe have a think about what may have changed for you, and see if there is something that may have triggered these symptoms for you.  If you have a therapist/Doctor, it might be helpful to bring these new changes to them to discuss it, to try and help figure it out.

As far as dealing with some of your new symptoms, perhaps some of whatever coping skills you have may be helpful.  For example, when you start to feel the sensation of being scared in the dark, using relaxation techniques to help calm down (I'll share some of the ones I like with you).  Making your sleep space a safe place may be helpful (like using your favourite blankets/pillows, have a small light on, having a stuffed animal/teddy bear to snuggle with to help you feel safer, etc.  Maybe writing down your fears on paper/journal, so you can look at them more objectively during the day, and hopefully see if there are some legit concerns that you can work on (like the safe space), versus figuring out if some of them fall into an 'irrational fear' type thought, and challenge your thought processes to realize that those fears are not a real threat, to help over come them.

Perhaps making note of the dreams that you are remembering, so that you can talk to someone about them the next day.  Sometimes just writing everything out, to vent out the thoughts and feelings, can help relieve some of the tension from the dreams.  Plus if you figure out what is happening in the dreams, then seeing if something can be interpreted to some issue you are going through right now, maybe it will make sense, and help lessen the weirdness of the dreams.

Sometimes using  **Distraction (Self soothing) techniques** can be helpful. (Sometimes finding things to take our mind off of the things that are contributing to our anxieties/mental health issues/thoughts/feelings can be helpful. It might sound silly and superficial, but sometimes just doing little things to busy our minds and our hands can give us a bit of a break. I have a list of Distraction (Self-Soothing) Techniques I use to give my mind a break. (it's revised right now to take health restrictions into account). ).-------

jig saw puzzles (you can find some online if you can't go buy some)

crossword puzzle books (you can find some online if you can't go buy some)

word search books (you can find some online if you can't go buy some)

paint by numbers sets (not sure if you can do this online or not)

playing cards/solitaire

drawing pictures

colouring books and crayons/colouring pencils (sounds juvenile, but colouring can be very relaxing and a good distraction technique)

write a poem/story/journal

board games

books (read an old favourite, or find something you normally wouldn't read, to see if you can find something new to enjoy)

craft type kits (maybe start a new hobby that isn't too expensive)

do some chores/cleaning around the house, maybe it's a good time to finish any projects you haven't had time to complete.

gardening/spending time in nature

exercise (dancing, stretching, skipping, anything that moves your body)

listen to music/songs/sounds you like eg: water sounds/thunder &amp; lightening storms/whale sounds/etc

talk/phone/text a friend/face time/post online

relaxation techniques (Ex: progressive relaxation); deep breathing

sing songs

yoga

light scented candles/incense (relaxing)

take a nap

re-watch a favourite tv show/movie; or watch a new show that is out of your normal genres to watch, you may find something new you like

watch You Tube videos (Ex; Jelle's marble racing, ( [r/JellesMarbleRun](https://www.reddit.com/r/JellesMarbleRun/) ) it is quite fun and mesmorizing)

video games; computer games

make your favourite hot drink, or food you like

write a letter to someone

take a bath/shower with your favourite soaps/bubble bath

read other stories on Reddit (check out some other subs you don't usually read)

Have you ever been curious about a topic, but never had time to research it; do it now, Google is your friend!

Look up a beginners online course for a language you've always been curious about; learn a few phrases

if you are in an apartment with a balcony, (away from others), spend a bit of time on the balcony getting some fresh air, read a book, or magazine, or just sit and watch the clouds or do some deep breathing

\*\*---go for a walk outside only if your area is allowing that; practise social distancing and go to a more isolated area if possible; if it is not allowed where you live, follow the appropriate rules.

\-

These are some **Relaxation techniques** that I find most helpful, maybe some will help you, too-------

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there. [https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-practice-progressive-muscle-relaxation-3024400](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-practice-progressive-muscle-relaxation-3024400)
3. **Guided imagery**. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes
4. **Mindfulness meditation**. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future.

There is also a low dose naltrexone which is generally taken before bedtime. This has different effects compared to a full dose. The low dose is used to reduce pain, depression and some inflammatory problems. 

You have bipolar and are taking Wellbutrin? Because antidperessants and stimulants such as Wellbutrin cause and worsen bipolar.

[],,lcdc0,,,[],,,,text,t2_3zcl1wbk,False,False,[],"Are you able to afford dental implants? Like u/ImportantGuava7 mentioned, losing your teeth means you will also eventually lose the bone that was holding those teeth (at their roots). So your jaw shape will change over time and you will need to be re-fitted for your dentures (that's why you see elderly with their dentures popping out). 

It will be expensive, but it's a more conservative option than pulling all your teeth and leaving it at that. One option may be to get 4-8 implants at different parts of your mouth and bridge between the implants with fake teeth. Kind of like permanent dentures screwed into your mouth.

Sometimes implants are not an option due to bone structure or lack thereof. 

I realize reading that may make you more upset. I did not lose all my teeth but I have had to go through 20+ years of dealing with a dental issue that has slowly been changing my appearance as I continue to treat it. What I've learned is that the more conservative you can be with any dental work, the more longevity and options you'll have as you get older. I'm truly sorry to hear what you're going through... My dental issues have given me a lot of anxiety and many tears have been shed after various failures, wondering was it my fault? Was it the dentist's fault? 

In the end, I do echo the positive comments here that you will overcome this.

Just breath in and out slowly a few minutes without focusing on your thoughts. Just focus on your breath. It is wonderful that you have a nice family and good friends and you should be grateful for them. Others aren’t that fortunate and struggle with being alone and having no connections. I believe your friends are right and you do have a good heart and you should cherish it!

I’ve been in your place.... the random general anger, thoughts of suicide that would stop because “i can’t do this to mom”. What I’ve learned is that the root of the problem was me not loving myself: the general angriness was actually just me being angry with myself. And me saying “i can’t do this to mom” could be easily replaced to “my mom and my friends matter more than me”. I’m not saying they don’t matter, but in the end, even if we create a perfect family and grow old with the perfect person, we die alone. WE are our own best friend, from the first day to the last day we have on Earth! 

Practicing self love is tough and might seem stupid but it has changed my life although I still have a lot of work to do. Whenever you feel like beating yourself up for ANYTHING, ask yourself, if my best friend would be in front of me right now, would I be able to say to her the things I say to myself?

I remember my wife and her friend were talking, i didn't really have much to contribute to the conversation so i went to the supermarket to pick up the dog kibble as we had just run out. On the way there i became overwhelmed by emotion, and thoughts of not fitting in around my wife's friends. I should have called my wife and talked, or maybe called one of the mental health services i knew about at the time. but instead i sat in a park for an hour, cried and listened to music. It passed and i got up and got the shopping done. On the way back i started to get angry at my wife as it would only take me 40 to 90 minutes max to do the shopping. It had been two hours and she hadn't messaged me. I was still upset about them ""testing my response time"" before, i tried not to listen to this petty bullshit i could hear in my head. But all these ideas of her not loving me, her friend turning her against me. The longer i sat in the park, my frozen broccoli slowly thawing. I was overwhelmed by noise and emotion. 

My wife called.
I said ""took you long enough"" why the fuck did i say that, i am happy to hear her voice. Apologize right now. ""I have been gone for three hours, i need to phone you the moment you're done but you don't have.."" i finally got control over whatever was in my head. ""I am sorry I'll come home now""

I can't recall any of what she said but i remember she was crying.

I got home and i was a passenger in my body. I couldn't do what i wanted to, to apologize and hug my wife. I can't recall all of what left my mouth apart from ""i wouldn't want you to mother me"" which was apparently a reference to something she said in a previous ""conversation"" and as i would later be told off for ""throwing it back in her face"".

I just wanted to hide in the shed and process what was happening to me. But they wanted to talk and my wife was upset already I hoped i could make it better.

This is the first time i remember them confronting me about my abusive behaviour, i tried to explain myself but the friend accused me of making up excuses. My memory breaks down a lot here. I believe this is one of the times i threatened to kill my wife and dogs.
I remember losing control of everyone in my head and could feel them (the others in my head) grabbing my shoulders and clawing at my back.

I don't remember much of the hospital visit. But i remember being asked if i planned to kill my wife, when i explained how much i care about her and would do anything for her.

I got back home and the friend was still there, it was time for round two. I can't remember much of what happened but the friend told me that i needed exaggerate my condition to get help properly (i remember because it made me really uncomfortable) i remember agreeing with a lot of things and it ended with everyone agreeing that i needed more intensive help and i would phone first thing in the morning.

That's how i ended up here. A week later they gave me the letter to never contact them accept to collect my belongings and i would have to collect them under supervision of the police.

I believe those two confrontations are where i made the threats to kill them and i gave them no other choice.

If you have an awesome opportunity and want it, then give it a try. If you don’t, you might end up kicking yourself or wondering ‘what if?’... I say this because I did take this route, a few times I gave it a go, and I failed at each one. Not saying that you will, but I’m saying that even though it all became too much for me (i literally quit my dream job 2 weeks ago), I 100% do not regret trying. I learned so much about myself a person and as a professional that even though I’m unsure if I will continue my career path, its invaluable. I did it because I loved my job and my clients and I thought I owed it to myself after years of study. 

You sound like you’re smart and self aware. If you think you can put a plan in place if things go a little pear shaped, then maybe that’s an idea. I’m unsure whether you disclose anything to your employers, that could change level of support or responsibility. I chose not to for years until recently (but this is definitely personal choice and depends on so many factors). Also, it is likely going to really challenge your anxiety at first because it’s new and unfamiliar, but once you’re in a routine and more comfortable perhaps it might not be so overwhelming? 

I want to tell you to go for the awesome opportunity, but I understand how that’s almost like playing with fire. For me, I came completely undone and landed myself in one of my biggest depressive episodes, largely based on the chronic stress over a couple of years. Stress and anxiety are my biggest triggers to mood episodes. Again, it might be different for you depending on the specifics of your role (I had lots of paperwork/deadlines and travel). Ultimately you know you better than anyone else and what you think you’re capable of. You could always give it a go and if it doesn’t work out, see if you could pick up shifts again at the home care role? 

I don’t know if this has been helpful or confusing! But I really do relate to your dilemma.

[],,Pscheprascham,,,[],,,,text,t2_3djaqdpz,False,False,[],"Hi! First of all, I want to tell you, that many people feel the same way occassionally (me as well). It is just that all the media we consume shows us a different life: one that is full of passion, energy and meaningful events. But that is not what life *generally* looks like. Media just samples what people find interesting and condenses lifes to their most imporant moments and fits them in between 200 pages or 90 minutes of screen time. Often times, life is just ""meh"" or ""ok"" - it is what happens in between those meaningful events.

You refer to the people around you looking so enthusiatic and determined. You, doing well in university, giving your best, might actually look like that from the outside, too. So don't think that all of these people have a grand unifying passion that leads them through their days like a shining star. They are just going day by day, sometimes with more dedication, orientation and passion, and sometimes with less. (Actually, I have a heretic theory that many people decide to have kids only to fill a void within their lives and to be really busy for the next 20 years/ get a purpose.)

However - there are more and less meaningful ways to live a life. And you can find more meaning, too. Cultivating a small sense of purpose is better than nothing, even if it does not spark a huge passion right away. But you should not dismiss the small meanings and joys because you are distracted looking for something big.

How do you find those meanings and joys? 

First thing that jumps at me from your text is: ""The education I'm following only mildly interests me"" Why did you chose it then? And: maybe there is still a possibility for you to switch to something more meaningful. Why I am talking about meaning all the time? If you cannot use joy as a benchmark for what to do with your life, I think meaning is the second best thing. You will have some ideas about what this society needs (in regards to a job), or what your friends and family might need, or even what the world needs if you want to think big-scale. And then you can have a look of how you can contribute your little part to it.

And eventually, joy follows meaning. You will be happier doing something you find useful. It just might take some time (and baby steps, and trial-and-error) to find out what those things are. It is not enthusiasm this will give you - but something to live and work for. And maybe work your ass of for as well :)",,,1606050114,{},gd7nht7,False,t3_jyuo00,False,False,t3_jyuo00,/r/mentalhealth/comments/jyuo00/i_dont_see_the_point_of_my_life/gd7nht7/,1606071796,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,0,[],,,

I say this, because I think in your situation, there is no way around changing your life circumstances for you to really get better. You use caffeine to get you through tough times, but you are constantly overexpending yourself. This is not sustainable. 

I do not know where you live, why you need to work so hard and what your options are. I just want to stress that it is not you who has to change but the situation. You do not need to become an immune superhero, brush off all external difficulties with ease - you need to live a life that allows you to take rest.

[],,Pscheprascham,,,[],,,,text,t2_3djaqdpz,False,False,[],"I have a good therapist and can confirm that they exist. Also - when you write that your high school counselor was helpful to you, you might have come close to someone like that as well. So you could ask yourself what about her counseling was helpful to you and go from there. You could try looking for someone with a similar background/ similar properties or even frankly describe what kind of cooperation, counseling you seek with your next therapist.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; **Everything the therapists in my life tried to tell me about myself, I already knew.** 

Well, an official diagnosis is only the first step. You and your therapist need to be on the same page on what you are working on so that you can make meaningful progress from there. Usually, it starts feeling helpful after the first few session where you can actually *work* on your problems. It takes time. 

&gt; I've already looked up all the coping strategies and thought through all my problems. 

Well, you did not solve them, right? A therapist will help you reiterate on them, look at them from other perspectives and challenge you to take a different viewpoint. And while I had a very similar impression at the start of my therapy (i.e. ""I know what my problems are""), I must say that I learned a lot and changed my view on them quite a bit. Plus, my therapist helped me to actually *perform* the strategies which I already knew would be helpful, *but never did anyway*. 

&gt; How can I find the ""right therapist""?

Give them a chance. They need to go through the boring diagnosis phase in the beginning - the real benefit comes afterwards. Also: communicate directly - tell them that you are fairly sure about what your problems are, and that you want to do something about it rather quickly. 

&gt; Am I just too damaged for therapy? 

I am convinced everybody can get something out of therapy. But you need to be open, willing to learn and accept therapists as people with flaws. That does not mean you should stay with someone who clearly does not help you (which seems to be true for the cases you mentioned above) - but it means that you need to give them a chance and wait some time until you can see whether their approach works.",,,1606047760,{},gd7iokm,False,t3_jyskfn,False,True,t3_jyskfn,/r/mentalhealth/comments/jyskfn/i_hate_therapy_and_its_a_scam/gd7iokm/,1606069461,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,0,[],,,

[],,alyanneful,,,[],,,,text,t2_38viwx78,False,False,[],"I was hoping for more discussion on this cuz I think it's very interesting, especially when you shared this observation:: "" I strongly disagree that my options are larger than those of a 37 year old woman. Young men don't have the same aversion to older women than young women have to older men. I feel that I feel uncomfortable in social groups where I am older because I get the sense that women see older men as being in a lower league. Conversely, I get the sense that older women see younger men as being in a higher league, hence why I feel more comfortable hanging out with and dating older women."" ( Sry for weak formatting I don't know how to do the indent thing on my phone.). 

We basically have exact opposite opinions, which I'm sure are both valid and true for us. and I would really love to hear some other voices in this discussion..... because I'm going to argue that if you are in America, my logic is more commonly held than yours. I don't know what country or region you live in or even if you're living and the same time dimension.... because I don't know any women who were interested in younger men. and every woman I know considers younger men to be below their league. nobody likes to admit it, but most of the stereotypes are true: women want a man who is older, more stable, more successful, and more established than them to serve as their protector. They explicitly want men who are physically larger and biologically older than them. on the flip side, traditionally and stereotypically, and probably if you did an objective survey, you would find the reality that most men in America prefer younger women and you see it over and over and over again. Let me get specific: 40 year old men date women between 20 and 30.  (Scott Disick and every other man in America). but 50 year old women are NOT dating 20 year old men unless they are there sugar mamas and the guy is a sex object (Maria Carey, madonna, j-lo,  demo Moore) what do these women have in common they are all independently wealthy. 

so if you seriously want to attract an older women, you better have six pack abs, sparkling eyes, and strong arms to scoop her up in, and a hard dick. And no career so that you are available at her disposal, or you work for her. so I guess I understand your obsession with youth and good looks if you're trying to trap a sugar mama.

 But if you're looking to get married and have a normal relationship you should probably look for a girl your age. No woman I know has ever turned down a date with an older men because they prefer young men. the reason you see older ( often divorced) women interested in 20 year old dudes is cuz they want their hard dicks. But look closely that's all these women want these men for. they will fuck around with you on the side but still go home to their house they own because they're an independent woman and they don't need you.

I have to acknowledge that you posted this in a mental health forum so perhaps you were asking for double check on delusional thinking and that's what I'm going to suggest you do. Go pole three men and three women in your town. don't give me an excuse that you don't have any friends. I'm sure you go to stores and buy shit, next time you're there, ask the clerk , just say ""hey I'm doing an informal poll, do you prefer dating people older or younger than you ?"" Note their gender, write it down, and then give me the results of this poll. I'll try to do the same in my city of Sarasota Florida and we'll compare notes and then check again on whether you are having ungrounded thinking on this issue. don't ask people on the internet expecially anyone on Reddit ;) ask real people that live in the vicinity of you and then you will understand how your peers and your community actually feel. Or just look at your friends I mean are all of your male friends really dating older women? How much older? My sister's new husband happens to be two years younger than her but they are both equal socioeconomically. My uncle married a woman 20 years younger than him. I am on a dating site called seeking arrangements explicitly trying to find older men to date who have more money than me. The last guy who I dated who was younger than me had no ambition was terrible at planning dates and was actually terrible at sex too. (That's how most established women view young men) it can go one of two ways as men get older, they either struggle with erectile dysfunction or they have more experience and understanding how to please a woman and they genuinely become better at it and women like them more for that. I love dating older divorced guys because they know how to find the clitoris!

are you working with a therapist because if you're in America I really think you have delusional thinking. I'm not trying to be mean or shame I criticize you that's just a word to describe beliefs that are ungrounded in reality. Which may be why you feel you have this anxiety around it because it's actually just not true. 

What are your actual relationship goals? What age group of women are you actually attracted to 35 40 45 50?

Also all that 'still exploring stuff' why haven't you done that yet (or enough of it to satisfy you) cuz that's what your twenties are for? is it more true that you missed out on those opportunities in your 20s for whatever reason and now you feel like you're playing catch-up in your 30s and that's why you're behind? Again my intention is just pure curiosity and interest on your situation dancer doesn't really matter I'm just trying to fill in the blanks. cuz in the 30s is when people start settling down, finding long-term partners, buying homes, settling into career paths. an older woman doesn't want to do that wandering around with you, she's looking to settle down. I think you'd actually be more successful and perhaps more fulfilled pursuing 25 year olds who want to travel the world with you. Especially if you can pay for more than half. and that's why I meant you have more options because I think women 18 to 35 are going to be interested in you and the majority of them are single. I really don't know what range of men are interested in but I know for a fact that most of the men between 30 and 40 are not single. or the single ones are so far below my league that I won't waste my time. let me know if you want to keep going I think this is pretty fun and interesting but I'll wrap it up I really think that you're dealing with some strong anxiety that's keeping you and your head and not out in the field exploring. Your age is a great time to meet a single woman between 28 and 34. Or date me! am I old enough for you? PS I am not financially independent will not be your sugar mama and expect you to pay for all the dates is that okay?",,,1608244176,{},gg6sfsp,False,t3_kdxx6h,False,True,t1_gg1tcpw,/r/mentalhealth/comments/kdxx6h/i_think_i_am_so_devastated_by_aging_because_young/gg6sfsp/,1608272644,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,0,[],,,

I had these same thoughts even after I started therapy and started getting better, because it felt like no matter how much progress I seemed to make, in the end there were still those times when it seemed like I was in the same place. Recovery really isn’t a straight line. Some days you will feel good, other days you won’t, and sometimes it feels like nothing has changed, but these instances don’t negate the work you have put in and the growth you have achieved. 

I made a realization yesterday (after playing red dead 2, lol) that during any story, there is always conflict in some form, internal, external, sometimes both. This is part of the story, and it’s part of life. It sucks, it really does. But there would be no story without conflict, and there would be no life without struggle.

I’ve tried to do different things, like dedicating my time to language learning, reading and drawing but nothing has really come of it. There was an initial spark in pursuing those as a hobby but I don’t really feel like I have the energy or time to do them now. I’m kind of trying to restart doing all of those but my life feels like such a mess considering the upcoming exams (as it’s my last year in school) and the stress of doing all the prep for homework and exams at the same time. Tbh I’ve thought about it and it seems that the way I feel right now might be related to symptoms of adhd because I literally can’t focus on anything for long periods of time and I tend to take longer than other people to think up an answer when answering questions or hand in my work. That also really impacts people’s perception of me as a person and it seems like they eventually get tired of waiting on me, thinking that I’m just a dumbass, who can’t form coherent sentences, and in the end that leads to them not wanting to do anything with me. It’s really hard to connect with other people because of this and I feel really useless as a human being. There seems to be nothing that I’m good at or that I could ever catch up to thus not being able to prove myself as a person who puts in a lot of hard work into what they’re doing because to other people it all seems like me finding excuses to not be better. I’m just endlessly hoping, similarly to you, that I might be able to turn my life around at some point but everything feels so goddamn uncertain that it hurts. Like I’m just wasting my time for no reason and not getting any better at anything, not knowing what it truly feels like to be myself. My low self-esteem does not help the cause at all.

Maybe in the end I’m just not trying hard enough? It might be an issue of not searching enough for what I truly like to do and not being able to see a therapist to somewhat resolve the feeling of gradually losing happiness and connection with the world.

You do have to understand this advice gets posted -a lot- to places like /r/mentalhealth, and associated subreddits where the readers may tend to skew towards more serious mental health issues.

But you're shouting into a void of people this advice hasn't worked for. Without the follow up you provided, it's easy to assume your advice is just another throwaway line from someone who can't empathize with people in this subreddit.

So since I do still agree with the initial assertion that going for a walk -can- help (not all, but maybe more than less), I'd actually like to bother you to make a new topic and share your expertise. 

Cite sources, relevant quotes, studies, and tests performed. Create a post with irrefutable evidence of the benefits of going for a walk. While it may not apply to everyone, there are enough depressed people here with the resistance to the idea of ever getting better, and reading a post that challenges their core ideals on the subject may be enough to get them up and walking, which might not help, but is a first step towards positive changes they can make.

You can also keep your dates in public places until you feel ready to explain, in places that are inconvenient to leave (dinner, a movie, etc.) so there's no expectation of sex. 

I would not start getting intimate with someone before you've given them at least a vague idea about what you're going through, simply because you don't want to have a triggering first experience after your trauma. 

You don't have to share any more than you want to. ""I'm recovering from \[rape/sexual trauma/sexual assault/whatever wording you prefer to use\] and so I'd really appreciate it if we could go at my pace."" That alone is enough but if you wanted to add a little more you could add ""I really like you, but"" at the beginning of that sentence and if you feel comfortable, adding a little more about what you need from him or her if you do get intimate (ex: ""\[specific sexual or physical act\] is really triggering for me."" or ""I might a little more time to relax"" or ""Because of my trauma, I struggle with guilt when I say no to sex, so could you please help me by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?"") 

There are plenty of ways to show affection that aren't physical: time spent together, thoughtful gestures, listening, etc., and not wanting to get physical with someone until/if you're ready definitely shouldn't mean you can't date.

I'm sorry if I'm assuming too much when I say that. It's also true that manipulative people can get into your head no matter what your childhood was like. But being mistreated as a child lowers a lot of the defences that other people have against this kind of behaviour.

Either way, I'm so sorry that that happened to you. You didn't deserve to have someone disregard your feelings that way.

Tried to get referred for an adult adhd diagnosis and they wouldn’t even consider me for referral. I am now diagnosed with adhd, shockingly, they got it wrong. There’s NO FUNDING!! And all this bullshit from the government being like ‘were investing in mental health services!! We’re great!!’ And it’s like, are you? Are you really? Basically the nhs works on the basis that you only get treated once you try to kill yourself or have some sort of unignorable manic episode or psychosis.

You can walk into a&amp;e and see someone, but you might be there for hours and sadly the level of care differs drastically depending on which hospital you go to. And ofc in the crisis you don’t really want to go to a&amp;e.

If you can’t go private, keep calling them, keep emailing them. Whatever service you’re hoping to go with you have to keep pushing it. Normally it’s like a 6 month waiting list (in my experience) for talking therapies or CBT, unless you’re under 18, sometimes it’s a bit less and at least you get a psychiatrist then. Phone up any local charities and ask if they have any advice, the people at Mind have helped my cousin a lot. Sometimes hospitals have mental health services attached so you could try calling them. I know it’s the last thing you wanna do when you’re depressed but if you want any help you will probably need to contact people multiple times. It sucks and I’m sorry!! If you have a family member or friend that can help please ask them for support, I’ve helped my friends who don’t like calling people :)

If there’s any possible way you can go private I would highly recommend it because it’s the only way you see someone in less than 6 months and it means you can get more than the limited number of sessions you’ll get from the nhs. Again, if you can call up people often they’ll be able to offer you lower rates if you’re a student or low income. I’ve had therapy for like £15/hour rather than £40 before because I was a student. I understand this may not be possible but I thought I’d suggest it because it’s what I’ve done and my parents have just sucked it up and borrowed money of my grandparents. I’m incredibly grateful to them and I know you might not be lucky enough to have this, but after 6 years of struggling through on the NHS, with undiagnosed ADHD and BPD it had to be done. I’m very very fortunate. I don’t know how old you are but if you’re at school or uni they may be able to help?

I just don’t want you to feel so hopeless. I know it’s fucking shit to be in this position, 15 year old me and 19 year old me at my major crisis points are relating hard to your struggle. You’re not alone. Please please try and find some stuff online if you can and if you want to message me I can give you more advice from my many years of dealing with this.

In terms of getting your medication, I'm not sure if online therapists can prescribe meds, so I would suggest calling or setting up a zoom appointment with your regular doctor ASAP (before the weekend) and explaining the situation and see if he or she can't give you one prescription to tide you over until you can get to a psychiatrist. 

If you're looking for something a little more substantial, lots of psychiatrists who normally work in person are now seeing clients over zoom.  If you want a psychiatrist that you can visit in person when COVID is over, google psychiatrists in your area and call around to their offices. Explain your situation (that you have a diagnosis and have received meds in the past but the office closed down and your mental health is really suffering) and I'd be willing to bet that nobody would turn you away. 

Psychosis isn't something you should have to face alone. I know switching mental healthcare providers can be really stressful, but it sounds like you need to speak with someone who knows what they're talking about.

I think if it's bothering you a lot or you're having specific thoughts of violence against yourself or another person or animal, it's time to talk through that with a therapist online. There are a bunch of programs that have free therapy sessions online (and more that have free trial periods you can take advantage of) and most online therapy sessions accept insurance (and if you don't have insurance online therapy is surprisingly affordable). These people have heard everything (pretty much nothing you can say will shock them), and they have training that can help you control your thoughts. I'm not a psychologist, but if violent thoughts are becoming intrusive, that's a great, low-risk first line of defense.

  
Maybe this is oversimplifying the issue, but if you know you're having violent thoughts after watching murder or killer videos on YouTube, you should definitely stop watching anything like that. Watch stand-up comedians that aren't abrasive (that always makes me feel better. Highly recommend John Mulaney and old clips from The Daily Show with Jon Stewart) or something that will cheer you up. If you can't stop watching them, block youtube from your phone and switch to Netflix or another, curated video streaming platform.

also i would highly recommend “progressive muscle relaxation” meditations... you can find lots online (free) right now. or there are many paid options. learning thought stopping techniques can also help tremendously when your mind runs away in an anxiety spiral.

I have similar problems and am currently going through a DBT workbook which is helping me. The first chapter is on distress tolerance skills and creating a distraction plan. It is literally about accepting the situation and finding alternative ways to deal with overwhelming emotions.

I'm not sure if I am allowed to post links or anything, but just Google 'distress tolerance skills DBT' or 'DBT distraction ideas' and you might find something that helps you.

I’m not achieving anything therefore I’m a failure or whatever. I’m trying to kinda write a list (I just voice record on my phone bc it’s easier for me as I’m a stream of consciousness person too) of what I did that day, good things I did even if it’s just I helped my mum when I felt stressed or I had a shower.

Do you find you have loads of hobbies but like you have too many to know which to engage in? Because I have tons of things I like doing and can get really absorbed in but like if I’m not in the mood for any of them I’m just NOT in the mood and I feel at a loss and end up watching 5 hours of YouTube videos and feeling shit about myself. I’m thinking of maybe writing on paper a list of things I like so I can remember all the things that sometimes help me feel better or just entertain me so I have a lot of options to choose from. I’m more of a creative type so I like lots of different things in this area. I also want to de clutter my room because it’s so messy which makes my adhd way worse but I find it hard to tackle things like this because I’m so all or nothing. I’m planning on breaking it down into small tasks and not allowing myself to start one huge task which I then can’t finished when the adhd momentum wears off.

I feel you about the friends thing too. Honestly I think most people are just cool doing their own things and don’t like trying new stuff whereas I LOVE doing new things. I think you have to lower your expectations, accept that most people aren’t going to want to play your fav game with you or whatever and then actively seek out people who already enjoy that activity. Making new friends is scary and it’s hard to know where to start I know but I think this can be worthwhile and you won’t resent your current friends for not liking all your hobbies too.

I'm a therapist who found out only 2 years ago at the age of 27 that I have ADHD, largely because I don't present with the hyperactive symptoms that most of us associate ADHD with. In my personal and professional experience, inattentive type hardly ever gets noticed before first being diagnosed as some mix of anxious or depressive disorders and most mental health professionals I work with tend to try to address those symptoms to better isolate the underlying cause first. If you can identify that  you have always had these struggles and it isn't linked to underlying trauma or just present when you're more depressed, I'd say there is a pretty good chance this is ADHD. Ultimately, my observations on your post mean nothing though- I would suggest trying to get a formal assessment from a psychologist or psychiatrist who understands inattentive ADHD to get a proper answer.

No one else has come even remotely close to explaining what I experienced. 

As far as the ""before"", I looked at everything as it was and was so convinced there was nothing else (including a higher power), that I just needed to enjoy life as it was. Being an atheist at the time, I didn't really care too much about ""life"" questions, but they were always there. Mainly got into LSD just to see what the fuss was about, and after the first trip, it was just an amazing experience. Felt like everyone should go through it once at least, but not after the last time. 

Now, all I think about is life, death, and the afterlife. I've actually had plenty of dreams where I die and experience what happens after. It's real trippy, but it almost feels.. normal?

Another thing too, when I was talking with ""god"", I had a really strong feeling that I was actually talking with my past/future self. Like, it was god, but it was me. The saying ""I am the end and the beginning"" always rings in my head

Some of my thoughts... I find it interesting that on your last trip, you were speaking with God. I'm of a spiritual persuasion, and I would be inclined to say that it is no coincidence that right before your ""downfall,"" the Creator revealed Himself. I don't know if you remember what you experienced Him saying to you.

But consider looking into the past. What was life like for you before, when it was ""full."" Did you seek greater meaning in life? Did you consider the metaphysical questions regarding existence, the nature of your being? How exactly did you end up taking drugs in the first place - was there a yearning?

My man, I could be so wrong here and barking up the wrong tree, but I think your little encounter with the Big Man Upstairs was Him letting you know that it is He who is taking everything away from you - all the meaningless things that ""filled"" up your life and clearly weren't enough to satisfy you, which promoted your retreat towards drugs - so that you may now sate and fulfill an emptiness that was there from the beginning.

My advice to you? Use your blank slate wisely. You are a capable, smart guy. You can work on yourself and uncover the truth of who you and I are. Meditate, my man. Great place to start: look up a book called Autobiography of a Yogi. There is an audiobook. Can send you a private link.

I think you're really healing, and part of that ""journey"" is definitely you sharing it here. I encourage you to continue fighting for yourself and do the things that empower and strengthen you, as your experiences were filled by helplessness.

I am not entirely sure what you mean by your question in the title. But if I had to guess, I would say that the abuser's name may serve importance to you, as you went through the trauma. But as far as for us/others, I don't think it's really important.

Praying and hoping that this person has gotten better, and realized what they have done. They may not be saying anything to you but they may be suffering from immense guilt over all of this. I can only hope that one day, if/when they do, they will ask forgiveness - at least within their own heart.  


EDIT  


I wanted to add another thing. I don't know - it is entirely up to what you feel you need - but engaging back with this person may not be necessary. After all, the goal is to heal, and I think that when you've gotten yourself to the point you're being empathetic towards the horrible past this person may have endured to have done the things they've done to you - and you're hoping they're better...

But sometimes we need to feel like we deserve to feel better. We want to actually be worth it, not just feel like it. I'm not sure if that's exactly what's going on for you, but these are things that have occurred to me.

First of all, there is a kind of therapy geared towards this sort of thing -- existential therapy. Other kinds of therapists come from a direction of already having decided about the meaning of life. Some of them thing life has no meaning, but we should feel like it does anyway (Freud thought that). Others think life has a meaning and it's about love, joy, togetherness, etc (this is an attitude you often find with therapists who are attracted to spirituality). The strength of existential therapy is that it takes the meaning of life to be an open question. It doesn't assume the answer either way. If you're curious, you can look at the book ""Man's Search for Meaning"" by Victor Frankl.

In a way, I've come to see a sense of meaningfulness as something that arises naturally when your mind is working well. If you aren't feeling it during your blue periods, don't take it to heart. Don't assume that this is how things ""really"" are.

It sounds like this guy wants people to understand him, but as you said he doesn't want anyone to worry about him or give him empathy either. That makes it really hard to support them. I'm saying that because I don't want you to feel bad about struggling to support your friend -- it's just really hard.

If he wants to open up to you, just listen and let him know you're connecting with what he's saying. You'll notice you're really connecting with someone if you're feeling stuff related to what they're saying. Like if he's talking about feeling fear, and you start to feel a bit afraid. Watch out, because you can end up being in as much pain as him if you do this too much. On the other hand, it's a really basic human need to have other people feel things along with us. Try to take a middle path and connect with the feelings he's talking about sometimes, without being afraid to give yourself space at other times. 

I think he would be better off opening up to people at school or through the health-care system, but don't pressure him to look for help. It sounds like he has a lot of sensitivity about opening up to people, and forcing him to try when he doesn't feel comfortable might backfire. It would be good for him though if he could do it.

Besides connecting with him when he wants to talk and supporting him to get help from professionals when he feels ready, there isn't a lot else you can do. But you don't always have to do something extra-special to help. If you just care about this person and stay part of his life, you'll be helping him through.

They mean what they sound like they mean: derealization is when things stop feeling real, and depersonalization is when you stop feeling like a person. They come in degrees, so you can feel more or less derealized, or in different ways, or (in your case) at different times of day. Hopefully these words help you find some good materials.

Just remember this is something happening to you, it's not something you did wrong. It happens to a lot of people, especially when you've got a lot of painful emotions that are hard to deal with. These painful emotions are really connected to your body (like for instance how we hunch our shoulders when we're afraid). If you want to feel more in-the-moment and connected to life, you have to connect to your body too, and with it these strong feelings.

I know a way to do that (I learned from my therapist) but I want to warn you BE CAREFUL!! You can really mess yourself up by diving into all the painful feelings you're keeping at bay. Just dip your toes in the water. Poke around very gently to see what's up, giving yourself space to get upset.

To connect to your body, just focus your mind on some part. You can start somewhere safe like your hand. Try to feel how tense it is. Probably until you start to pay attention to it, you won't really know how tense it feels. Once you start to feel that, probably feelings will come up. If it's tense, it could be because of fear, anger, or sadness is causing you to tense it up. Don't try to force it, just notice what comes up. You also might find you get thoughts associated with it too. 

This is something you can use to start connecting with your body and your feelings, and then also connecting more with reality and being a person. Again, though, I want to warn you to be gentle. I know you probably just want it all over with, but you have trouble connecting with your feelings for a reason.

Based on the way you're describing your experience, though, you sound pretty depressed to me. Before I was diagnosed with depression, I thought you had to be like staring at a wall, just like numbed out, to count as depressed. But actually feeling extremely sensitive, going from feeling angry to sad, and generally feeling like the stakes of life are so high and you're sure you're going to fail -- these are all parts of being depressed too.

Also, I'm sure you've had people tell you not to compare yourself to others, but it's so true. Where there's smoke there's fire. Especially with pain -- pain is literally just the feeling of pain. How is it possible that the pain you feel is actually not as bad as it feels? If some people aren't hurt as much by the same things, well, that's great for them, but that doesn't real change your situation. Just remember that even Anne Frank, in her diary, says that other people have it worse than her. The question isn't where do I fit on the scale of people having a bad time, it's just am I in pain, and what can I do about it.

I can tell things are really hard for you right now. But don't forget you're someone who has loved and dreamed, and hopefully still loves and dreams.

First off, I'm really sorry for your loss. My mom passed in July 2019 from cancer as well. It's a terrible thing to witness.

It's really tough to give good advice when it comes to grief because it affects everyone differently, even within the same family. Have you spoken to any family members? Do you have any siblings that have also been affected by your mom's passing? Sometimes that helps if you have a good relationship with them.

As far as flashbacks and replaying those last days in your head, have you tried talking to your counselor at all about it? I haven't talked to mine yet, but I keep replaying the last time I saw my mom alive and it upsets me every time. I can't say whether it would help, but it's worth a shot.

As someone who has PTSD and has been through years of trauma therapy, trauma is the effect a situation has on you. Not the situation itself. It takes an ""extreme"" situation to create a trauma response, but the definition of extreme is pretty subjective and varies a lot from person to person. It's also perfectly normal to compare your trauma to others and see yourself as inadequate. It's a defense mechanism; your brain is trying to convince itself you're safe and this is no big deal so that it can protect itself in the future. The downside of that is that it makes you think your suffering doesn't count. It does though! You can put two traumatized people together and they'll probably both do it. Let's say one was in a terrible car accident and the other was a child abuse victim. The accident victim might say, ""at least mine was over quickly, I can't imagine having it happen over and over"" while the abuse victim may think, ""at least I knew what to expect, imagine having it happen out of nowhere."" The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Or in this case the trauma is always worse. In truth there's no such thing as worse. It doesn't *matter* what anyone else went through. Everyone deserves appropriate care. Does the fact that I was abused somehow make your traumatic experience not have happened? Or in some way preclude you getting treatment? No, it's irrelevant to your situation. You have the same needs regardless of what I or anyone else is going through.  


Just so you know you're not alone though, I struggled with this a *lot*. Part of my trauma involved my mom dismissing the abuse as no big deal. And the first psychiatrist I asked about PTSD told me it didn't count because my abuser was disabled and therefore I should have protected myself better. Which sounds *insane* to me now, dude should not be practicing psychiatry, and every doctor/therapist since then I've told about that has been appalled. But at the time I accepted it at face value because it fit the narrative I'd already been stuck in. Learning to accept that my trauma is trauma has taken years, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't still have my doubts. But it does get better, it just takes time and effort.",,,1585485899,{},fltsm9t,False,t3_fr3hp9,False,True,t3_fr3hp9,/r/mentalhealth/comments/fr3hp9/what_is_trauma/fltsm9t/,1585485900,1,True,False,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,,0,,,,

Two (with clients that are interested and have a lot to talk about), there’s no body language for us to look at and fewer pauses in conversation.

Jus a few months ago I was dreaming about getting my permanent residency. After getting my permanent residency I was dreaming about taking my next step, finding a job in London. I had already changed my life and tried to be more outgoing. Haha you can fuck that now! I was trying and for the first time in my life had success with meeting a real girl. I was already looking at videos of London and imagining myself living there. I had also taken my first solo trip and was planning to take more trips. I was getting tired of my company and was planning to switch jobs on the short term. I had already planned everything and was waiting to hand in my resignation. I was gonna take a two month break in between and visit my mother and have yet another solo trip or two.

Guess what happened?

1. Permanent residence is delayed because all the offices are closed. I would have had it this fucking week. 

2. I cant switch my job anymore. No sir! I am stuck at my current job for the coming 6-10 months, maybe years. I can either risk getting unemployed and switch or get stuck here.

3. Cant apply for jobs in London cause the virus fucked it as well.

4. Cant go out and meet people. Cant be social. At 31 I decided to make a change in my life and life told me ""Fuck you!"". 

5. Its harder to meet women now. I am getting older. I wanted to get married in a year or two.

6. Cant do anymore solo trips, you can fuck that.

7. Cant go to the gym. I workout at home but its not the same.

8. Most of the big event/movies are postponed.
