Saving up to go to tradeschool is a means to an end. And contrary to popular believe your job is NOT supposed to bring you joy. It CAN, certainly, but it also can provide the security required to participate in activities you enjoy with people you enjoy with. 

So, you have a dream. You really want it. How to get there with what’s available? Save up. Do that dead end job because you actually want to get to the end of this plan and achieve your dream right? Save for trade school. Possibly get financial assistance due to your income level. Work for a few years in that trade while you spend your free time creating the framework for your dream, whether that’s purchasing computer equipment, music equipment, art equipment, whatever it is. Research and figure out the ways to achieve this dream and manage your resources to get to it. Some of the worlds millionaires and billionaires became successful at 40-50-60.

[],,iLok_hart,,,[],,,,text,t2_1yv619q5,False,False,[],"Trauma comes in varying levels but always has an effect, and affects people differently depending on their makeup.

Coping isn’t something you just suddenly do. It’s like looking at music on a page and knowing what position your fingers need to be in to play each note smoothly. That means you need technique (a method and plan) and repetition (practice).

If I know there is an environment where I might be triggered, I make sure to alert myself that there might be a word, behaviour, or event, that is somehow related to my past trauma, but is NOT that trauma. For example, role playing is pretend, but that doesn’t mean your character can’t stand up for themselves if you deemed it appropriate. If you know there’s a situation your friend might take the scene, you might even preemptively take that friend aside and say, “hey, when we do these fun roleplaying activities, is really like to refrain from any insults. They don’t really contribute to the game and aren’t particular to my character. Calling a character stupid is just poor imagination and not addressing the story at heart. I don’t enjoy it when we have to get to that level to keep the story going.” You can also tell your friend to please, in any context, not to call you stupid. That’s just a boundary. 

As for preparing yourself for the random attack, you create a word frame where you address the comment and de sensitive yourself by applying contradicting information. You’re stupid? But you know how to do this. You are good at that. You can critically think. You build up your idea of who you are against the insult and build a logical argument (not an argument really, but just plane facts) that disprove it. 

There’s also understanding that people do not naturally tell people they are in a deficit of something. Normal acceptable societal behaviour is to offer constructive criticism OR take over the task OR ignore it. For example, if you were hopeless at computers, someone might offer suggestions and help to remedy it, or offer a third party assistance to take over a computer task for you. OR they’d just do the task themselves so as not to waste time OR they’d just like you kind of struggle. Actually insulting someone’s intelligence is showcasing turmoil in the person who’s hurling the insults. So consider what is personally happening inside someone who says something hurtful? In the case of your brother it might have been an issue of bringing you down so they could feel better about themselves. This means they’re under an undue amount of self loathing and lack of confidence. Knowing that their outburst comes from a place of pain, can often reframe the insult in your head and it just doesn’t feel the same. 

All these things can be achieved through strong self awareness and discipline, but many people find therapy is a great way to have assistance in overcoming triggers.",,1590637660,{},fs1x7ze,False,t3_grymod,False,True,t3_grymod,/r/depression/comments/grymod/how_to_cope_when_i_expectedly_triggered/fs1x7ze/,1590645390,2,True,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,0,[],,,,,

there are a few things that i do that help me, take from them what you will, but remember that these arent instructions to follow to the tee, merely experiences passed on from one bleeding soul onto another.

1. i can control this. i repeat these words to myself when im depressed to remind myself that these feelings of agony... are mostly from me and to me. i can own my depression and these feelings are temporary, these memories are in the past, and these circumstances that im imaging are mostly fiction.

2. acceptance. whatever the sources of my depression is, be it trama, stress, sadness, chemical imballances, injury, genetics, whatever, it is what it is. so now i just need to work on making it better.

I honestly don't know anything about them, or how seriously they'll take your claim, but I'm hoping that they'll at least look into what you tell them.

Also, if your parent used insurance, it might not be a bad idea to contact the insurance company and let them know about the abuse - if the police won't look into it, the insurance company might, and that could affect the facility's ability to collect insurance money.

I sometimes think of just killing myself or disappearing from this world but I am just too afraid to do it and  I have been uninterested in everything for about 2 years now. I pretend to be funny and happy but there are times where I can't mask what I am truly feeling. I don't really pray but there are times where I have a breakdown and then start asking God. Why am I here? What is my purpose? Is there even a point in living? Am I okay? And then start asking God to end my suffering. I sometimes wonder what the reason I became like this and the only reason I could think off is that this all started from my grandfather's death which was 4 years ago I slowly get more depressed day by day until to the point where my academic grades started going down, my relationship with my family worsened, I became more distant with my friends, I tend to lock myself in my room alone and then this, realized that I had no good qualities on me, and then Covid19 happened. Online class was the most tiring thing that ever happened in my life. The amount of assignments doubled, the teachers tend to teach way too fast, the amount of screen time makes me dizzy and nauseous, the subjects became harder to understand. And then I started skipping online classes and missing works started to come in. This affected my mental health really big. I have been a bit unstable lately and not only that I didn't even want to meet my relatives. I had fights with my parents, started talking back to them and they  are getting disappointed in me and learning about  that makes me even more unstable and tend to have even more breakdowns. I have been trying to socialize with people to gain confidence but it ends up in me losing confidence. I cut myself, sometimes I eat too much and sometimes I don't eat at all. I have been sleeping a lot and dreaming about on what would I be if I didn't become this mess. Other people's opinion about me is a big deal to me. I hate it when tell me things I am not like for example just because I was able to draw an anime character after multiple failures they said I had artistic talent, I don't my handwriting isn't even that good and  I don't even know how to do the coloring. My drawing can't even compare to drawings that are traced. The subject I was good in math not anymore I used to be in the A group in math with grades of 90 now im here with a 75 and my parents really really treated me bad when they say my grade. I really with I could disappear. I wish a genius soul could just replace me. In school the mask I wear or the persona I use is the ""class clown"" that's how many people saw me. Juniors made fun of me same with seniors. I started reading  manga so that I can escape from reality even just for a second. I started self inserting myself into characters that it became a thing I do everyday. The reason that makes me want to wake up is to read manga and separate myself from  reality. I had thoughts like ""what if i was born like him"", ""what if i was transferred in another world"", ""what if i was reborn or reincarnated"","" what if a system window showed up and I can use it"", ""what if I can rewind time."". These thoughts are what I think of everyday. I think manga has saved me from ending it all. And my parents think of manga as a nuisance. The one part that hurt the most is when my I told my parents I had depression a year ago. They didn't take it seriously nor sympathized. The next they they acted like it never happened. That day made me so down that I thought there was no hope for me. I almost ended it that day till a friend of mine called me to play a game. I guess that call saved me that day. My friends know that I am depressed but not to the point of me wanting self harm. I wish that I can really just sleep all day without anyone bothering me. This disinterest is getting worse day by day. Same with my depression. my relationships get worse day by day and I don't even know what is the point anymore.

[],,pewpewewwy,,,[],,,,text,t2_8t3ryl3n,False,False,[],"To be honest, when I was in college I was depressed and had terribly low self-esteem (still kinda do, but it's better now). I had a hard time socializing and constantly felt lonely and lived as if there was COVID. I occasionally went weeks without talking to anyone except the cashier or some teaching assistant. I played a lot of video games (and watched a lot of porn) to at least cope with the situation. 

But I knew the only real way out for me was to actually get good at something useful and use that to earn my confidence, which would make it easier for me to socialize, and then maybe I wouldn't be as depressed. 

Maybe that's not a healthy way to look at things, but I didn't have a better idea. If I didn't force myself to shift the momentum from a downward spiral to an upwards one, things were only going to get worse. I was depressed anyway, so I figured I'd just try it. 

So I pushed myself to get good grades, transferred to a higher ranking school, and into a STEM field. My depression got worse and I started to get really bad anxiety. Luckily, I made some good nerdy friends whom I could relate to, and that helped tremendously. I neglected a lot of my needs, but I did graduate with the respectable degree I wanted. 

I was completely burned out by the end of it though, to the point where I decided to change careers. Nevertheless, I do have more confidence now and I'm not as afraid of being judged unfavorably in social situations as much. I feel slightly less anxious because I know that worst case, I'll still have a job that pays alright.  

I know my advice isn't exactly what I followed, but it's what I wished I had done. I wish I had taken better care of myself in the short-term while I was working towards the long-term solution because I burned out and hurt my physical and mental health a bit too much. I wish I had a better solution for you, but life is extremely difficult for people like us and that's the best I could come up with.

I don't blame you for wanting to not be home and feeling depressed. You are in a super tough situation right now and you need to go super easy on yourself. Right now your environment is nothing but toxic when it should be giving compassion and love. Unfortunately, it's on you to give yourself that compassion and love. Treat yourself the same way you would treat a friend you love dearly. Take time to do what makes you happy and you enjoy and don't make yourself feel guilty about anything. You need to do what you need to do to stay happy and mentally healthy.

Whatever your parents or family tell you they're wrong, they don't know you, they don't know you, they don't know every thought that's been in your head, and every moment that's shaped you. They never will and that's a good thing. Every word they say should go in one ear and out the other, don't even for a moment consider they're right. You matter you're not worthless, you're not fat, and you shouldn't for a moment think that you're being selfish for wanting to not be home or work on your school. If that really mattered they would step up to the plate and make you want to stay with them not guilt-trip you.

It really sounds like you are dealing with some really mean spirited people, and I wish I could do more than just send you a positive message over the internet. If you can't find a time to voice call your therapist could you email them or text them? I'm sure they care and want to help you out in this situation, and please feel free to vent as much more as you need. You are going through a lot and you need any support you can get.

Take it very slow, because forcing yourself to get better can hurt. Reach out to friends or family randomly, and keep the conversation positive....ask them about their days and be a good friend. Pick your hobby back up, and start cleaning areas of your home you may have neglected. Fold all your clothes. Do extra self care. Get into a routine of doing and saying nice things to yourself.

This isn't meant to be confrontational I just want you to consider this thinking. You feel like you're an over complaining asshole, but do the people you know think that? Have they told you that, or refused to listen to your problems? and if not, does that mean you're actually an over complaining asshole, or does it mean you think you're a needy over complaining asshole.

&gt;I'm tired of feeling like I talk to much and everyone finds me annoying and secretly hates me.

A lot of the same as the earlier thing. Is this actually true or do you think it to be true?

I struggle a lot with taking for granted that the thoughts I think are automatically true. I've thought that my friends don't like me because they don't call me up all the time to spend time with them. I've thought that I'm ugly.etc but the thing is, when I actually ask myself where the proof is for what I think, there's like no evidence to support that idea. I'm assuming things about the world because they feel true not because they are true. When I' ve opened up about how I feel I've realized real wrong about a lot of this. My friends don't hate me it's not that they've been avoiding me, they haven't had time for anyone, they've been busy or struggling with depression just like me. It's called emotional reasoning and I think it hurts a lot of people.

It's important that you get this stuff out of your head, but to be honest I don't think what you said about yourself is true. You sound very self aware which is a very valuable skill, but it can also lead you to being too harsh on yourself. You may not be able to at the moment get a full break and recharge, but do what you can.

I may have been in love with her, but I will also some day be in love with someone else. Fast-forward to about 12 months later, and on new years day, she messages me and asks to meet. It turns out the year had been awful for both of us and we both were honest and I feel like fixed everything, we're friends again now and I couldn't be happier.

I thought that if I couldn't be in a relationship with her, then I couldn't have her in my life but I've realized I was wrong, and now that I've found myself better and understood what I want better, to be honest, I've realized that she and I would not have worked. I was certain she was what I wanted but I've realized that I was just blinded by my feelings. The feelings I had for her are gone, I've moved on and have found someone new. I know it hurts right now, and being ignored is the worst feeling in the world, but there will be someone else. This is not your only chance at finding love, and someday this hurt that seems so overwhelming right now will be nothing but a memory. Time is how you move on from a crush, I wish there was another way, but that's the answer. Let's face it there are a million songs out there about struggling to move on, this is a big issue for everyone, but you will move on.

I’m not saying that because you aren’t worthy to be with, but rather because I’ve been there (dumped) and then chased (didn’t work). 

People want what they can’t have. So begging or pleading with her to stay together will only assure her that she has you as an option. 

With that said she will likely feel comfortable / ok being alone knowing if the grass isn’t really greener as she seems to think it is at the moment, she can always come back to you because you showed her she could by chasing after. 

Not going to lie to you, being single at this point in time sucks. I’m 39. So I feel your pain about age as well. I was left 3 years ago after being with someone for almost 4 years. Haven’t dated since. 

Now with COVID there are so few options to meet someone and develop a relationship. And it’s not just our age, I’ve talked with a few people I know in their 20s who are single and date and are good looking and they all say dating is sad situation right now. 

I would say you need to keep yourself busy. Focus on your kids. Have as much fun as possible with them. 

I found that being around people and especially kids after my breakup made me feel a lot better. Being alone by myself just spun me into a depressive downward spiral. 

As hard as it is right now try to establish a routine of healthy sleep cycles. Eating right. Staying busy. 

That alone will mitigate a lot of bad things that could get out of control.

I totally understand things are hard and sometimes they don't make sense. I think part of what you're feeling is this intuition inside that you know there's something wrong with this corrupt life, that's why we set our eyes toward our eternal hope to be with God, to be free from this sinful state. Those thoughts telling you to end it are the voice of the devil, he knows the hope of Christ you have inside of you, he doesn't want you sharing that with others. He even tempted Jesus to kill himself too, the devil is afraid of the power that's in the cross. There's people in your life that depend upon you to lead them from darkness into the light.

Volunteering at some kind of animal shelter or soup kitchen, etc. You have to interact with people to do that kind of volunteering so you aren't physically alone anymore. Along the way maybe you'll meet friends or someone more as well.

One of the first things someone who is  emotionally and physically abusive does is to isolate their victim from their friends and family so they are under the abusers control. I find sometimes it's helpful to imagine depression is a person. How is depression treating you? What kind of things does it say to you? Has it isolated you so that you are more under its control? Does it chip away at your self esteem?

[],,cantordustbunnies,,,[],,,,text,t2_590b3mlp,False,False,[],"I really don't like using cliches but in this instance I think one applies - ""not judging someone unless if you have walked a mile in their shoes."" If someone born under extreme circumstances such as abuse and poverty were to have switched places with you at birth and had your exact upbringing and brain chemistry etc - maybe they would have faired far worse and have had way more issues than you, and maybe if you were in their shoes you could have overcome their situation much better than they could have? Or maybe the reverse is true. What I'm trying to get at is that everyone is an individual who deals with situations and emotions differently and that you can't really judge someone else's suffering because you haven't lived inside their mind and had their exact upbringing and/or set of genetics. It's entirely possible that someone born under dire circumstances might end up preferring their life over yours if they could see the effects and the struggles of both.

Also, having problems with mental health is not a character flaw or a weakness. I highly doubt you would think someone is morally at fault for being born blind or something, right? Events in your life can hurt your mind just like events in your life can hurt your arm - but whereas a broken arm is obvious a depressed mind or someone with ocd or adhd isn't something that other people can easily see - but that doesn't mean it is a character flaw for having that problem.

Depression makes you feel bad in general - and it is making you feel bad about feeling bad. When you reach out, talk to people who you trust about it, try to get help for it, and move forward in your life you are fighting depression. When you feel ashamed for being depressed, feel pathetic, give up, stop trying to seek help because you feel you shouldn't have depression to begin with, and when you feel invalid as a human being, you are giving into depression and are feeding it and making it stronger.

One thing that I found really helped me as someone who deals with depression is to imagine that I am a small child or cute animal or another person or something. Imagine if some little kid came up to you and had issues with OCD or depression and your reaction was to tell them that they're stupid and pathetic for having these problems because other people in the world have harder life circumstances than them. Could you imagine yourself saying something like that to another person? Why do you say these things to yourself?",,1599449588,{},g4aqmsu,False,t3_inz57v,False,True,t3_inz57v,/r/depression/comments/inz57v/feel_bad_for_having_depression/g4aqmsu/,1599449599,1,True,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,0,[],,,,,

What do YOU want to do with your life? 

I didn’t goto college and I have a good job. Sure, my mental health is in a horrible place right now, I‘ve been in-patient 3 times in the last 3 months and I’m currently at a residential mental health treatment center where I’ll be living for at least another 30 days, away from my wife, family and loved ones (I’m not even going to begin to go into the unbearable horror show that is my past mental health issues that have haunted me for 23+ years). But I have the health insurance from my job to help me with all of those things. A job I got without any college education. I did terrible in high school too. Had to switch to an alternative school because I was in such a terrible emotional state.

The only advice I can offer is to try and keep in mind how your depression may drive the frustration that you describe. If these involuntary emotions are being met with further frustration and anger, perhaps it is time to address how you go about viewing them. I don't mean that you can just change your view on sex, of course not. If you hate sex, hate the idea of it and feel like you lack a conventional sex drive then no amount of convincing is going to change that. From you or from others. What you can do though is try and approach unwanted thoughts/emotions as intrusive and self defeating. To say that sex is ""one of the few pleasures people have"" is beyond subjective.. it's simply not true.  Only you have the power to choose your indulgences, and that truly does mean something different for everyone. In a perfect world, people like us wouldn't have to worry about our feelings being taboo. All we can do is work on not allowing our feelings to be taboo to ourselves.

[],,OverDistribution2,,,[],,,,text,t2_4zpc3l0y,False,False,[],"I get it. Your totally right to feel that way. It shows that you are a genuine human being. You look for more in others. 

For me its that I am most likely Demisexual (I don't understand how anyone couldn't be, I just  thought it would make sense to pursue anything sexual if there is an emotional and intimate drive behind it. Its more human.) But it seems people don't work that way and if they see anything with a particular body shape they'll fuck it.  As well as fantasising of having effortless, creepily flawless, plastic Hollywood relationships with them. Nothing deeper or passionate. 

I *believe* (as any sexuality or feelings related to it have been repressed due to childhood trauma with the belief that no one will ever fall in love with me) I have a potential sexuality, but I can't express it. I'm not allowed to, its not possible for me to and I wish that the world would genuinely change so that I could at least try, to at least believe.

its funny because I only really noticed this relatively recently. I am a huge fan of Terminator 2 and the main character is played by Edward Furlong (not really creepy because I was the same age watching as he was then which was around 13) I recognised him from a film called Brainscan. In Brainscan, he was the first time I ever really noticed anything aesthetically pleasing about someone. (the way and age he is now...nahhhhh) but what was funny is that he seemed to have a really interesting personality. I was 16 rewatching watching, as we he.

I didn't think anything of it much at the time.

I also think I prefer people who are my own age (19) (and it seems to stop there, which will be a problem for later years, my only attraction it seems would be to people who are within the 18-19 age range, I'll be 20 soon) who are in more Alternative Scenes. Goth/Punk/Emo, not as a particular fetish or fixation, but because the appearance to me, reflects who the person is and (I am a firm believer that you express your emotions and thoughts in how you dress) the Alternative scene is more to do with expressing deeper emotions and different ways of viewing things.

I don't find the modern beauty standard attractive either, everyone looks like fuck ugly Barbie and Ken dolls with fake tans and undercut hairstyles. Essentially clones of the cast of Love Island. And you can see their personality in that. Fake, plastic, vapid. (I also realised that I find Dana Tan from Batman Beyond aesthetically pleasing, if she showed she was a sweet, caring person and was wearing a Nine Inch Nails or The Cure T-shirt I'd be into her) Girls look like they are made of wax, you can tell boys look like Paul Brothers, Yuppie, wannabe contrepreneur twats who think saying ""Ok Boomer"" or thinking through the lens of shitty memes makes them interesting. I don't care if they are successful entrepreneurs, they're soulless. My years in High School taught me that normal people are dickheads. I don't care about this ""Generation Z is all accepting, superior master race of gods who will change the world"" idea. I have Asperger's and I was bullied relentlessly by these ""socially accepting messiahs"" I don't care about any generation, just the individuals who are genuine and express themselves. 

Sadly, nobody is interested in being genuinely Alternative or self expressive anymore. There are no Goths or Emos or punks anymore. Anyone who proclaims to be a part of those scenes is driven by trends or social image and are more influenced by the normal aesthetic, with vague, diluted remnants of the scenes added.

So I guess I can't find out what I'm really grounded to in attraction. Which is a shame, because for just once I would have liked to believe I am worth it.

As officially accepting as the world is now of Sexuality, I personally feel stuck in the 1950s. Everyone is attracted to the same exact thing, whereas I'm in a position where my feelings and attractions deviate against the norm, the world brags about how its becoming so much better, but I don't see it.

I’m still feeling off but it’s not as hard to move around today. I would get stuck in one position or place after finally moving a little. Really struggled with processing, and felt largely emotionless aside from just feeling deeply sad that it was happening again, and all I could really do was stay in bed and sleep/zone out. If at any point I was getting up, it’s took me anywhere from 20 minutes to maybe even an hour to go from lying down, to sitting up to moving my legs off of the bed to actually standing and walking. I also deal with psychomotor agitation at the same time I‘m in the severely depressed states, which results in my limbs jerking around/twitching involuntarily, which also happens in my sleep, which makes resting hard. You probably know what I mean when I say it’s hard to rest with all of that going on anyway. For me I know it’s triggered by a lot of past and current trauma and stress and, at the moment, my life is very stressful. I’m diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum (“high functioning” or whatever), and having major depression, and complex PTSD. I’ve had most of these symptoms since I was a preteen. 
I agree with you about finding out the names and diagnoses. A lot of people get hung up on not wanting to label things, but I find it useful in a similar way. There’s words for it. Doctors talk about it, and then it feels more real and more accepting of the fact that, though it is all in my head, that makes it no less real to my mind and body and well being. That other people experience this, too. And that both makes me very sad and somewhat relieved.

[],,EstExecutorThrowaway,,,[],,,,text,t2_u1vk9,False,False,[],"Hey, if you want to stay in touch I am terrible at habit and routine.  I once spent 2weeks on an elimination diet (low allergen foods) and exercising twice a day.  I felt AMAZING.    But, like you, I eventually started tapering off and after several weeks felt just as terrible as usual.  

I think it’s because the good habits took up almost all my free time.  Once I felt like I achieved “wellness”, I wanted to go back to the things I enjoyed.  Hanging out with friends, eating nachos, being lazy, drinking beer.  

I’m trying to get back into a routine or healthy habits too, so if you need a support network let me know.  

Perhaps what we need to do is make our “habits” enjoyable, so when we feel good following through on our routine is what we want to do (as opposed to chasing distractions).  

I don’t know the best term for this, but I’ve thought of it too.  “Sisyphean” is close, same with “homogeny” which is being “homogenous”.   Homogenous means “Alike or being all the same” and in science it often refers to when a “balance” or “baseline” is achieved.  So if your baseline is your lazy lack of habit, “homogeny” would be returning back to that from your short lived good habits.  Again, perhaps we have to make our good habits and feelings our “baseline” somehow.  

Btw, interestingly enough, if you google “science back to baseline” like I did (trying to find a simple word for it), the resulting articles are about happiness/sadness",,1590631019,{},fs1m7nd,False,t3_grirci,False,True,t1_fs1brb6,/r/depression/comments/grirci/as_soon_as_something_starts_working_i_quit_doing/fs1m7nd/,1590639318,2,True,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,0,[],,,,,

It’s definitely hard out there especially with this virus going on. What is your passion in life? Definitely make sure you are striving to achieve happiness for yourself, NOT OTHERS!

I haven't exactly been ""patient"" with him and have started a ton of arguments to provoke an attack from him. Like I said, he is severely out of shape and overweight so he has never started a fight, he knows that he wouldn't win. I am religious as well and I know that it was wrong to do that. But back then, I justified it by thinking if I didn't start the fight physically, it would be okay. I used to do those things about a year ago. But I realized that the only way he can change is when he finally realizes that he needs to for himself. Occasionally, I'll tell him to clean up whatever mess he's made or to flush the toilet when he doesn't. But I have my own life, and don't really care what he does anymore. If he's fine with being a fat slob, that's his problem. I'm just surprised that he isn't bothered by the fact that his last relationship that he had was in 7th grade. Maybe he is, but I don't see any effort to try to change. He moves out in a couple of months, and I think the entire family will be happy that he's finally getting out of here. He didn't do it by himself though, of course he needed our mom to buy a house for him in order to do so. As for me, I'm going to college and am focusing on that as well as staying in shape. I'm honestly thankful for my brother, because I try my hardest to not end up like him. And to not be a shitty person like him. I always remind myself of him when I am about to be rude to someone, or if I'm tempted to skip a workout. I ask myself ""Do I really want to be like him? A failure with no motivation? A fat slob that can't even take care of himself?"" I know that sounds rude and harsh, but it's the simple truth. 

Anyway, I hope your situation with your brother has improved. Has it? If not, take his failures as motivation. And don't let his indecencies get to you. You can rarely get others to change. They can only change when they realize that they need to. One day, he may realize how nasty of a person he is and that it's time for some changes. But if you've already tried to get him to realize that and he didn't, then he is the only person that will be able to make himself understand that he needs to change.

It's also good to vent everyone once in a while. I made the previous post because I was literally about to go into his room and kick his ass for a stupid reason. I hadn't been bothered by him for a long while, but luckily that post settled me down. Knowing him, he'd probably call the police on me.

From my perspective as someone who has dealt with severe depression and suicidal ideations, I don’t think I would be here now writing if I hadn’t reached out for help or talked to someone.

Because after all, it’s not the depression that kills you, it the pent up feelings inside that do. Depression is such a complex illness that plays with peoples minds. Hell, if I were to look back as a fifteen year old, I have no doubt I would never consider killing my self. Yet when I turned seventeen, I almost tried. 

And the scary thing is that if someone had not found out, then I wouldn’t be alive today. Mental illness is an ILLNESS! You cannot be healed if not treated. It’s hard for those around people who suffer from these issues but it’s even more ESPECIALLY harder for those afflicted to reach out for help!! Your father probably doesn’t want any of his loved ones to be worried or scared, he doesn’t want to be a burden. 

But trust me you can’t believe what you see on the outside. At 17 I was a straight A student, doing many extracurriculars, volunteering, I was literally a model student and yet inside I was hurting so bad that I wanted my life to end. Depression doesn’t discriminate race, age, ethnicity or religion. It is an ILLNESS, it is not something we do to ourselves or ask for. Depression can affect anyone no matter how good of a life they have, and regardless of their spiritual beliefs.

Believe me when I say your father doesn’t want to die. He doesn’t want to leave this world, go against his religious beliefs but he wants to escape the pain and misery he is feeling right now. Tell your mother, make sure she understands what depression really is, and approach your father carefully about this. Be patient and be understanding. 

It’s not as simple as just being sad. Sometimes it’s the chemicals in our brains that literally aren’t working properly enough. Please I hope everything goes smoothly with your father and your family. Stay strong, safe and healthy. Wishing you all the best !

Dads keep much of their emotions hidden from their children.

 For a long time I worked my butt off. When I was 14 I got my first job and worked 20 hours plus school. By 18 it grew to 40 hours plus school, plus study groups and being constantly connected to people. I didn't let myself have a second alone with my thoughts. I had chronic pain condition and a horrible home lifethat I couldn't stand to think about. The moment I did let myself be alone I was incredibly down. I had insomnia and I couldn't sleep. I was too wired. When I was working, I was numb and I soon adding starving while working to keep my mind even more numb (age 17). With others I could be distracted. I got better after finding God. But realised more recently that I didn't seek the help I needed from people. When I would go out for a night with friends I would be happy and then end in tears. Alcohol doesn't allow you to hide emotions so I couldn't drink anymore when out. Even when I got a full time job I worked weekends, pretending I needed the extra money when in reality I didn't. At home I would work around the house, or go to the gym. Anything to be busy and distracted at any hour of the waking day. In the last year Ive slowed down a lot. I stopped working weekends and then I missed it. I missed the distraction so I started volunteering on my Saturday nights. I had a realisation recently, that I'm not taking care of myself. That my self care has been incredibly lacking for ages and my body knows it, even if I haven't acknowledged it with my mind. My body shut down on me since I let myself relax more. My physical symptoms have increased again.

No one calls me out for crying when I walk out of a bathroom, its simply “unspoken &amp; understood”. When I come in “tired” looking... I haven’t slept in days, albeit I tried. I come home and dread long weekends w/o something to “do” (ie fuckin’ work)


Right now I’m on a MH leave from work... otherwise I would have been fired because I could *feel* myself going so intensely downhill. My job gives me self-worth. Being off is better for me but it feels terrible.

It’ll be difficult but with baby steps you’ll slowly build yourself and realize there’s so much that you haven’t even experienced and you will slowly but surely be able to! 

For every time you ever feel low or negative counteract it with a positive thought. I recommend journaling how you feel and doing this as a written exercise. When I started I was able to look back at what I written on my worst days and realize (only after) that maybe it wasn’t as bad as it seemed and feel proud of my willpower to keep going for life. Once we slowly nurture self love we’ll see life from a different perspective. 

Our challenges and sadness don’t make us, they help us grow and you’re a fighter!! stay strong and always remind yourself every morning you wake up that you’re worth loving yourself, you’re worth someone’s attention, love, and support; that you’re worth good things that await you.

Depression is hard. I first learned that I had depression when I was in my 20s. All I saw when I looked around was my failings. I started counseling. That's when I started to look at things differently. If you want to see only the negative you can find it everywhere. I started to do something different. I started to really look at myself and start listing my positive attributes is all good things I was doing. I was surprised that the list was a lot longer than I imagined.

If you want to see all your shortcomings, mistakes, and failures there's always something there to make you feel bad. Once I saw how much positive there was and decided to stop only seeing the bad stuff I started to get a much more balanced view of myself.

I'm 51 now. I still have depression it doesn't go away. But a lot of the things that you think are failures or shortcomings are things that are just harder because of depression. I have to give myself permission to have certain shortcomings and to just accept them. This is really important. I still try to be the best that I can and I actually think I'm a pretty good person. I'm smart I'm funny I'm compassionate and I accept myself more now than I ever have.

I don't feel better about myself after learning about the hard lives of others or the world's horrors; instead, it just excacerbates my depression by reinforcing the idea that life is chaotic, short, meaningless, and full of pointless pain and suffering.

The lack of a close-knit support network that you can open up to (i.e friends) is likely one of the reasons behind your depression. It becomes all the more painful and lonely when you're trapped inside your head with your inner demons; cut off from the outside world and everyone else. I also don't want to burden others with my personal problems because I assume they don't want to hear about it. But I always end up dumping my personal problems and life story on anyone that seems remotely interested in talking to me; as a cry for help and connection, I suppose. As a socially isolated and anxious loner since 13, with my only lifelong friend being my younger brother who's 7 years my junior, this rarely happens. The emotional abuse and neglect from my parents, especially my mom has caused me to avoid interacting with others and forming social relationships with them. I grew apart from my brother a few years ago, so I'm socially isolated now with no friends as well. I'm 23 now (24 in 2 months) and hope to eventually move out of my parent's house, work towards self-employment, and find my peace and happiness in a tumultuous world that is rapidly falling apart.

I was a smelly non- moving mess deep in the abyss. Had to go on disability.

Took me until my 60s to begin to manage anything resembling a life again. Very small, quiet, solitary. But I am better than I have ever been.

I don't have friends but my goal, after covid shot, is to make 1 or 2 good acquaintances in the next year. I n9 longer verbally abuse myself. 

Most ppl see this as laughable, not a real life, but for me it's huge. I wish my first 40 years of different therapists hadn't tried to cure me, which really was trying to change me into some supposed norm: outgoing, social, witty, etc. I was never that and each round of therapy, til the last, they convinced me to fake it cuz I'd make it. And each crash into the abyss was deeper and longer.

I would have suffered less is therapy had been used to learn management skills. I'm quiet, shy, awkward, average in looks and build. And that's okay cuz that's me.

I feel a bit more like a survivor of depression these days than suffering from it (though it is always lurking and I have visited the abyss a few short stays).

Most people who have ever had too much of an alcoholic drink has experienced a hang over. You drink and it feels good, so you drink some more, and keep drinking thinking it’s going to keep that buzz going until you finally drink yourself sick. The next day you feel sick again. Some people will drink again the next morning hoping it will cure their hangover which works for a while, but the more they drink the sicker they feel. It’s a never ending cycle of filling your life with pleasure only to leave you feeling sicker than you started, but you can’t have the feeling of pleasure with out the feeling of sickness, suffering, depression, and so on. Most people think that they should feel pleasure every second of every day for the rest of their life, and those same people who try to do this thing continue to involve themselves in this cycle. Do you understand what I’m trying to point now? 

To have the feeling of pleasure is to have the feeling of sadness, and one always follows the other. I personally feel much happier after I’ve had a good cry! After having lots of drinks buying lots of things I tend to live feeling empty. That’s exactly the trick though that’s the trap. To escape the trap you have to find a good balance in life, and stop hiding from the things that make you suffer. Instead try facing them. Don’t shy away from a hard situation, instead just buckle down and work through it. Put yourself in hard and uncomfortable situations, and you’ll start to see that you will appreciate those times of relaxation more and more every day.

I'm sorry for what you are going through, and that your parents are not correctly supporting you. I am no professional but it definitely sounds like you have a lot of anxiety and some depression, with the main sources coming from social situations and other people. To me depression and anxiety can be two sides of the same coin.

It's ok to feel what you are feeling. Don't ever feel bad or sorry or guilty for what you are going through just let yourself feel it and notice what you are feeling at the time. It can be useful to do something like keep a journal of when you notice a particularly strong emotion, and get it down on paper so that you can work with something tangible. And then maybe try to write down the specific trigger that started that emotion. Try that for me. Another thing you could try if this is hard is just spam your thoughts down on your phone or computer on a notepad so that it's out of your head, and then delete it, like burning a memory away!

If you haven't already, I really would try to get any form of professional help. The current situation makes things harder, but I am sure you can reach a doctor to help and at least to talk to someone outside of your family to get some advice and possibly some sort of therapy.

If you can, try to keep talking to your friends online, don't lose them. It may be even harder once you shut that connection off too. Please don't hurt yourself, you can work things out.

The reason I’m saying this is because I suspect you are judging yourself for putting your husband through this. If I’m correct, there is a solid chance that this compassion for your husband may be a bit amplified by your depression. The whole, “I’m making him suffer because I cant get better faster” mentality can be really really damaging.

My biggest suggestion is to shine a spotlight on it. Ask him if he is struggling. Ask him if he is overwhelmed. Ask him what basic minimums he needs you to meet. Maybe he would be OK to take on more baby care in exchange for you to try to give him 15 min of listening about his day? Or something like that? Or maybe he is actually doing really well, hero-mode style, and you are projecting?

Depression is like having a finite number of batteries to get you through the day.

[],,bobtnelis99,,,[],,,,text,t2_13bk4f,False,False,[],"I actually enjoy sharing my experience. I believe it was unique in a way and I've only heard it described the way I describe it a few times. I'm careful to try not to come across as preaching because my dip into the ""darkness"" ended up being a very spiritual moving experience. 

See, I have one true fear in life. Being left alone. I don't mind being alone, it's just when people give up on me and walk out. That's what happened this day. For whatever reason I had convinced myself that I wanted it. I've never heard voices before or since this day and this voice was the most reassuring and comforting voice I'd ever encountered. I was alone when my wife left and I went upstairs to the master closet. 

I double and triple checked the shelf to make sure it would hold my weight and I positioned myself so that it would be extremely difficult to stand up. I had a board leaned up against the wall so I could slide down it. The shelf wasn't high enough for me to just hang from it. I also didn't have anything but an extension cord. A solid heavy duty orange one. I tied it and checked to make sure my knot would hold. My setup wasn't perfect, but I wanted to take my time. I didn't need to go right away. I wanted it to be slow and clean. 

Everything was set. I put the cord around my neck and leaned back against the board. I slid down slowly until the cord was supporting all of my weight. My legs were out in front of me and my butt was about a foot off the floor. I could feel the cord cutting off circulation under my ears and I couldn't breathe because my weight had caused it to press my airway closed. I closed my eyes and everything went dark. I mean dark beyond dark. Everything got so quiet. It was peaceful. It was everything I wanted and at the same time everything I feared most. But I wasn't afraid. 

Then it happened. A knock on the door and the doorbell. The voice said only one thing to me. That's it. It said, ""Get rid of them."" I've never done a pullup in my life. I reached up and grabbed the cord and pulled myself up. I don't remember walking down stairs, but I opened the door with the security chain on it. It was my friend from a few houses down. She talked me into taking the security chain off and pushed her way in. That's when she saw the bruise that was already forming under my chin and around under my ears. 

I have no doubt in my mind that I saw the gates of hell that day and I'm even more certain that the voice I heard was the Devil. I've never felt so comforted or comfortable in my life. Everything I wanted was right there and it was so peaceful and perfect. I understand why people attempt multiple times if they fail. The reality is that it wasn't what I wanted. It was the thing I wanted least. I didn't want to be alone, but that's exactly what I was doing. Somehow I had been made to want my greatest fear. 

And it was over... I went into therapy and found some meds that work much better for me. I'll never go back to that place. I'm stronger than that and the people that care about me don't deserve to go through that. I'm here for a reason. Maybe it's telling this story. Maybe it's something else. 

Anyways, I hope someone reads all of this and finds a little strength to get help. We're never alone. All we have to do is reach out and there are people here. You can call someone or come here.

I don't want to go back to school, I'm fine with being a dropout, I don't want a job, I don't really care whether or not I have friends, I don't want a relationship or kids, I don't want to travel. My only interest is in watching YouTube videos and playing games.

Incredibly relatable. A few months before the coronavirus hit, I had a seizure and lost my license for 6 months, i've spent most of this time stuck at home having no social interaction, and I may have gotten a little too addicted to video games. I also had to quit my job to avoid the risk of infecting my parents, so i've had no job since febuary, only just getting hired somewhere else. For probably around 4 months everyday was so meaningless. I woke up almost daydreamed my way through the day and went to sleep with a sporadic sleep schedule. Here's the thing though, it's been one of the most important parts of my life, because it's made me realize what I really want. I've started working really hard at music, and somedays I still have trouble with motivation but I have something I actually want to do, and it's helping.

Maybe you don't feel like trying to achieve a lot of your objectives and goals because they aren't what you want. Maybe you need to find some things that actually excite you and make some new goals? You like video games and youtube, so maybe give that a try? That at least helped a lot for me.

As for your parents, any good parent wants their child to be happy, and live the best life they can, don't focus on thinking you have to figure out how to take care of them now, you'll make it work I promise. Right now you need to find that spark that excites you, and figure out what speaks to you, and if you're having trouble, then ask yourself why you're having trouble. Trust me you're not lazy or apathetic, you made this post because there's something about this that doesn't sit right with you, right now the best thing you can do for everyone is exploring yourself a little bit and figuring out where you are right now and what you want. I know avatar is all the hot rage right now, but there's a really great quote about asking life who you are, and what you want.

There is rarely such a thing as “lifelong friends.” Your high school friends are merely acquaintances you put up with until adulthood. You’re gonna forget all about them later on in life and it’s for the better. 

If they mean that much to you, keep reaching out. It is up to them to decide whether or not you’re important enough and if not, fuck them. 

As for your career, you can literally do anything you want to. Find jobs relevant to your industry like a music store and network. OR, find smaller jobs IN your industry to get a taste and then use what you learn to market your own work. 

Life does not end when high school does. Matter of fact, it ignites. If you say you’re gonna fail, you will probably fail. Believe in yourself and don’t EVER give up on your dream. 

The best way to “beat the system” is by grabbing it by the balls and making it your bitch. Nobody... not even society nor the government, can tell you how to live your life without stress and pain as long as you aren’t breaking laws.

Change seems so out of reach because for me personally, I focus on the end result and never the tiny things I can do now.

To give a quick analogy, when making a sculpture out of stone, the artist starts with a large slab of stone and slowly chips away at things until he has his end vision in mind. I think this is a good way to think about change, it's not a few large drastic changes, but tiny little things that makeup something that seems gigantic and impossible from the outside. I just want you to know that things can change, and even if it feels like you're trying your hardest and nothing's working out, that's okay you have time to get it right, and you will, you just have to go at the pace that you can handle. Just know that right now, you're doing the best you can each day, it may not seem like it, and it may feel like you could do more, but you're doing exactly what you can do, so please go easy on yourself and be kind.

Basically anything that can encourage a form of 'creative creation' that provides some form of unifying life project. For example, a writer/journalist may find genuine purpose in undertaking the process of story telling, as it is similar to what you could think of as the process of creation. The family man structures his life around the care of his loved ones - not merely because it may be enjoyable, but because taking responsibility for other people's wellbeing carries a deep sense of duty that provides meaning. Same sort of idea with healthcare professionals. An activist/politician/philosopher pursues their work because they want to transform their will to power - power being the ability to influence the world, and others within it, to change in a way that you (mostly) intended it to. That's why the saying that ""he who has a why can bear almost any how"" is quite accurate. 

Personally, I think the only hedonists - people who base much of their meaning on pleasure-seeking - left in this world are those who either abuse drugs or smoke cigarettes. But, going back to happiness, it's self-defeating to try and make that your 'why', because happiness is an incredibly rare feeling that cannot be manufactured. Most people are working in a state close to 'ok' - they're just not unhappy. They have other problems, such as insecurities and pathological modes of thinking, but they're not depressed.

If you're up for it, I can't recommend babystepping enough. Try to talk to person A for 30 seconds about cars and shopping, then change the subject to the important issues. Then try person B for 1 minute on food and sports, then switch over. Make the time you spend a kind of tracker for progress in getting close to others, and in time, you'll find the wall you need to push through, the number that's really hard to break through. If I remember correctly, it took me a week or two of practice to go longer than 5 minutes at a time.

Wake up with anxiety, mindlessly grind at my studies (which i'm not even into so i won't get anywhere anyway), then comes dinner time when i eat with my family (who are already done with my sht) while they silently judge me for being too quiet and just a failure in general.

I don’t think it’s unreasonable or unrealistic for you to expect that it’s something you can do before work. The huge benefit to TMS is that it’s very non-invasive. I’ve done ECT, which puts you out for the entire day after you get your treatment. You’re not allowed to drive at all on your treatment days. I’m also in the process of receiving Spravado treatments (esketamine) and it’s the same thing, you can’t drive the rest of the day. Plus that stuff just really makes you........uh, let’s just say feel extremely “weird and out of it”.

TMS requires more dedication (you gotta do it 5 days a week) and it takes longer to work but the tradeoff is that it’s much less invasive than other alternative treatments. Don’t let other people complaining about side effects concern you too much, there’s always gonna be people who have side effects to any kind of treatment for depression, whether it’s medication or something else. And they’re usually very vocal about the side effects.

Suicidal thoughts are a very scary and surreal thing for people who haven't experienced them to come to terms with, and in some instances, you might be better off never letting *some* people know. Believe me when I say that it scared some people, especially my parents. It took a long time for them to heal from it. For what it's worth, I did not tell them in the best way, either. It might be better to approach them or your friends about the issues that are causing you to feel suicidal, rather than starting with the suicidal part. It honestly all depends on what you're feeling right now. If you think you might hurt yourself this instance, I really encourage you to tell someone what you're thinking of doing. It may not feel like it, but it's a truly life or death situation. And from the sound of it, a part of you cares about your life. If it's just a general thing and you are simply experiencing suicidal idealization (I.e, you think or daydream about taking your life in no specific manner and feel as if you would be okay doing that) then really consider sitting down with someone and mentioning the issues that are leading you to think that way and maybe ease into how it's truly making you feel.

For what it's worth, I told my friend about it before I  told my parents, and he reacted well. At the same time, he dealt with similar issues before me. So it's a very chanced-thing.

I hold onto that hope...I know there is no actual reason that would make my life stay this useless and depressing. I know I'm capable of just totally reversing course and trying something new. That's why I tried this whole school thing, after getting yet another office job last year that was miserable, with miserable people, that made me feel useless and that would take me no where.

If you don't mind, I want to tell you briefly about my experience. I was admitted into a psych hospital last November after I experienced something 'traumatic,' for lack of a better word. I was obviously nervous before, as I had images in my mind of what to expect and what a mental hospital would be like because of movies and such. I, however, was surprised when I actually got there. Everyone, staff and patients, was so nice and welcoming. There was no judgement, and we were all supportive of each other. I made some friends there, and the day before I was discharged I actually cried because I didn't want to leave. My friends and family did not think any less of me. In fact, my mother visited often and my friends even came to visit one day after work. 

Everyone has different experiences, though. There really is no shame in being admitted, if that's what you're worried about. Also, you shouldn't lie to your therapist. They are the one person who you should be able to tell everything to. They want the best for you. My Specialist Therapist is the one who admitted me into the hospital and I'm glad she did.

This job was horribly stressful. It caused me to do all sorts of hurtful behavior to myself that I won’t detail here. I recently got a new job (2 weeks ago) and I’m finally starting to turn around. 

Here is what I can suggest solely based on my own experience.

1. Spend time in thought narrowing down what is causing you to feel this way. Seek friends/family and even a therapist to help narrow this down.

2. Once you identify the thing(s) causing this what can you do to resolve this? Again seek help if you cannot come up with answers on your own, I certainly did seek help.

3. Perhaps most important: Surround yourself with positivity daily. As a person that has fought depression I can tell you I would sometimes revel in my sickness. I’d seek out depressing music, tv, and people that would send me further down into this pit. DO NOT fall for this. Fight for positivity daily. It may make you sick at first, but don’t stop fighting for things that have the potential to lift your mood and bring a smile to your face. (people, music, places, ANYTHING and NOT DRUGS). Eliminate negativity as much as possible from your life.

[],,robizzle89,,,[],,,,text,t2_qteye,False,False,[],"I was depressed from 15-27 with really heavy depression at the age of 25 (going stationary). From 17-21 I also had social anxiety and avoided any form of social contacts. That fixed itself by changing my environment (new friends, new education, new perspective) but the depression stayed. Therapies didn't help. Antidepressants didn't help and I cut them from one day to another (which you should NEVER do). I quit therapy because it lead me nowhere. Note: this is my experience. Don't cut therapy or antidepressants if you're in a very unstable situation. I was somewhat stable but still in depression at that point.

What helped me, was one or the combination of those things: Exercise (big gym, new environment, new people to meet), fixing nutrition (Vitamin D, digestive system health is very important too), getting a job (even I didn't like it), becoming more responsible. I took responsibility for everything happening to me. Before I just accepted that I can't do shit and will suffer.

Also something that helped me a lot is actually thinking through the whole suicide process. I made it into a binary decision. Either I live or die. If I live there is no point in being depressed and thinking constantly about dying. If I die, and I tell you guys, dying is extremely scary since you stop existing, then I should at least have tried everything to being able to say ""well, I actually tried everything"". And there is no way you tried everything. Since a lot of people have comorbidity with anxiety the ""anxiety"" is actually blocking them from trying everything. And there is no point in letting your anxiety become more important than your life.

\- List them physically out so you can focus on them better  
\- Combine them if they can be combined (i.e. Good + Honest could be combined as Honor)  
\- Adjust them as you need if you spend weeks working on that trait and find you don't like it

Personally, I chose Honor, Strength and Freedom. I have the first two very well in hand I think, but the third is largely missing since I got married and had a kid (so I'm looking forward to getting it back later).

Once you have this plan, it's just a matter of babystepping your way to becoming this person, action by action and dialogue by dialogue. Don't push yourself hard on the outset, start slow and go easy: identity overhaul takes time, but it's well worth it.

The next day I pushed to 45, then the next was 2 girls at 30 each...

And make sure you mentally confront, get righteously angry at, combat and replace all inner thoughts of sabotage that you can't do it, don't deserve it, etc... because you don't want to be divided against yourself.

Does she have friends or family members you can contact to see if they have also noticed a change in her or if they have any idea what may have caused it? It's really difficult to help someone through depression if you don't know what they're struggling with.

I'm not a medical professional, but her behavior sounds typical for someone going through depression, or just a major stressful event in general. I've absolutely ignored and avoided people so that I wouldn't have to deal with their emotions and expectations. It's a lot easier to just be alone in your pain than to share it with others and try to fix it.

You can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped. If she's going to keep making excuses and not communicate, then you can't really help her with anything. What you can do is show her that you still care about her. How you go about that is up to you, I don't know what she likes or how you two connect, but I think it's important that she knows you're still there.

That said, there's a balance to it. You're right that you shouldn't pressure her and make it about you. Do your best not to get upset when she doesn't respond. Start to understand that she probably won't respond, and that's okay because this isn't about you.

It is also possible that she's just choosing a really bad way to end things between you two. But you don't know that. You can't know that unless she tells you. So try not to spend time thinking about things you don't know.

You need to focus on your own life. Stay productive at work. Talk to people. Write down your thoughts and emotions. Figure out what you do and do not have control over. Don't let this drag you down.

[],,bronwyn_,,,[],,,,text,t2_221onf43,False,False,[],"The first thing to know is you cannot fix someone who is mentally suffering with love. It’s helpful, but this is her journey she’s on, so don’t overburden yourself or make her feel guilty by taking on that responsibility emotionally.

What I’d have wanted more than anything is to know I was loved regardless. Hormones for young girls are HELL ON EARTH (and prob boys too) and I was angry and emotional soooo often, didn’t know why, and felt ashamed a lot which caused me to act out more. 

So I’d say, try to spend low key time with her, even if you’re in the same room each doing your own homework for example. If she’s into certain tv shows or movies, get into them with her, and invite her to get into what you’re into. Hug her if she’s into that. She might fuss but the knowledge that she’s loved unconditionally will help her feel more secure as she goes through whatever she is experiencing. If she acts like a brat and you need time to cool off, say that! “I can see you’re angry and I’m frustrated too. I’m going to cool off for a while, but I love you no matter what.” 

I’d also tell you to be direct if you’re concerned she’s suicidal. Idk if it’s just uncomfortable or if people are afraid they’ll give young people the idea - believe me, if she’s feeling that way she’s already thought of it. “Have you been suicidal, or like you don’t want to be around anymore?” Then let her answer. Don’t rush in to tell her life is worth living or something. She’ll likely feel judged and not listened to, and close up again. Some leading questions if she says yes, is whether or not anything has happened lately to make her feel this way. Perhaps her friend group is excluding her, someone she likes rejected her, she did poorly in school, etc.

Kids are dealing with very intense emotions just like adults do, but with the added stress of not having fully formed brains that allow them to talk themselves out of bad decisions. They need caring adults they feel safe talking to, so if things do reach a crisis point others can intervene.

I think that whenever you drag someone into your suicide attempt, fully knowing that you do, that it definitely is selfish. If you jump in front of a car/bus/train or whatever you are selfish and lose all the sympathy I mightve had for you.

Which is surprising. I just feel like a failure, personally. She encourages me to go on dating sites because she sees me lonely and she feels bad for me. And i want to be in a position where she won't have to feel bad or be worried about me.

That's great to hear, and please know love from a mother to child should not be surprising. It may not be normal in many families, but unconditional love from a parent is expected. 

As for her worrying about you, do you feel like you're going to be a ""failure"" as in not achieve your goals forever? 

If you don't, then maybe think about what will result in the desired outcome? Rushing into things, or giving it time to develop properly? Yes there is a possibility she won't see you doing better, but it is not better to rush for fostering good relationships and finding a good job. If you're mother worries about you not doing these things, talk to her and you can help her see that even though she may not be there to witness it, you can tell her that you will be fine.

If you do, then reflect on what being a failure is. People tend to see failure and success as very black and white. An example is ""I prepared for this job interview, I didn't get the job, that means I'm a failure."" But what I didn't realize I was not in 100% control of the situation, I am not the hiring manager, I cannot blame myself for not getting hired. If you are not 100% in control of the situation, how are you a failure? I am sure you had several obstacles in getting friends, pursuing partners, etc. that were not in your control. If you did not meet your goals because of external forces, how are you a failure when it wasn't your fault? I am hoping you are getting that I am saying you are not a failure.

[],,xvenusinfursx,,,[],,,,text,t2_5jsm9upi,False,False,[],"I'm so sorry that this has been your experience, and sending a lot of love and support to you, wherever you are. It's especially hard to navigate depression when you're not getting the support that you need from your family and when they make you feel guilty for wanting to seek help and for being depressed in the first place. I am so sorry that you haven't had more support at home, and I hope that they try harder to understand your pain moving forward. 

I just want to say that you are not a brat, or ungrateful, or whiny, or a burden. You are someone suffering with depression in a world where a lot of people don't understand anything about it. I was severely depressed for months and didn't realize it was depression because I associated depression with suicidality and constant, overwhelming sadness. You're not ungrateful for being depressed -- you have depression, and that's not something you can control. Depression doesn't care that you don't have bills to pay or how nice your parents are, and it breaks my heart that your parents have contributed to your feeling this way. 

I saw a commenter below who left a lot of great suggestions, and I won't reiterate them, but I would add a few things: 

1. Consider talking to your parents about how their attitude is affecting you. Depending on what kind of listeners they are, maybe write them a letter telling them how their comments are reinforcing your negative feelings about yourself, and explain how they can better support you emotionally. Sometimes, writing things down can be better because they can't interrupt or insert their own feelings into it -- and it might sit with them more to actually read how you're feeling. I really hope that they realize that their behavior is causing more harm, and that they listen and learn and respond with love and support. It's what you deserve! And if they still don't get it, try to remember that you are not a burden. Your parents chose to have you, and its their responsibility to care for you and give you a good life. I know I've found this reframe helpful when thinking about my family, and I hope it helps you too. 
2. Maybe talk to your teachers to let them know what's going on with you. A lot of people are struggling right now, and I imagine that they'll be more willing to work with students to provide flexibility and understanding than they may normally be (though ideally all teachers would understand that sometimes their students are really struggling). They can also help you find some resources for help and support! It can be really hard to open up to people about what you're experiencing, especially when your attempts to talk to your family have been so discouraging, but letting your teachers know what's going on with you might really help, and at the very least, it will alleviate some of your anxiety about them feeling disappointed in or angry with you. 
3. Definitely make that appointment with your doctor. I saw someone comment this-- I just wanted to add that your physician can actually prescribe antidepressants! I know it can be hard to find specialized care, and finding therapists and psychiatrists is no easy task-- it's so much harder when you're depressed and struggle to complete even basic tasks. But you don't need to find a psychiatrist to start getting help, and your doctor may be able to make referrals for mental health care that take some of the burden off of you in finding providers. 

You are struggling in a big way right now. I relate to so much of what you're saying, and I just want you to know that it will get better -- talking about it to someone willing and able to get you help is the first step. I, too, am extremely private, and it took me months to admit to myself that I was struggling, and then several more to say that to anyone else. But the more you talk about it, the easier it becomes (in my experience at least) to share with the next person, and the lighter &amp; better you feel. Please don't doubt your worth, or your intelligence, or your value, based on what you're currently feeling -- you are struggling with depression, and one of the worst parts of it is that it attacks your self worth and motivation in a vicious cycle. Try to keep in mind that you're struggling with a real illness, and be gentle with yourself (easier said than done, of course, but even if you can't stop the negative feelings, saying that out loud to yourself can be very helpful in countering the negative self-talk!).It's okay that you can't get out of bed. It doesn't make you any less of a person. 

Regarding the social element, though cliche, it truly does get better. Whether you work after graduation or go on to more school, you will meet people that care about and appreciate you for who you are. You're going through something very difficult, made more difficult by a lack of support, but I promise you, there is a whole world out there waiting to be explored and so many people who would love to give you the love and friendship you deserve ❤️",,1611199023,{},gk0toks,False,t3_l1hote,False,True,t3_l1hote,/r/depression/comments/l1hote/i_feel_like_i_have_to_at_least_try_to_kill_myself/gk0toks/,1611332188,1,True,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,0,[],,,,,

I used to hurt myself. I hid in my room in the dark. I basically talked to no one until I got into a relationship. I felt like I couldn't open up to my parents because my mum was an alcoholic and my dad was abusive. 

I was told similar things. I was young, had no job, no ""real"" worries. The thing about depression is it doesn't matter how ""hard"" your life is - it's just how your brain functions. And it sucks when no one listens. 

It took me failing a mental health screening at school to be taken seriously. My home was called, I was sent to the doctors and from there a therapist. There were a few other red flags but none of them were taken seriously. 

You don't have to prove your feelings to anyone. You just have to recognize that your feelings are valid. If you can do that, and you're willing to get help to not feel this way anymore, you're already on the right path. I still have people in my life who question my struggles because I mask. I had to to survive when I was younger. Now it's just how I cope. I'm not depressed all the time, but depression also isn't what everyone thinks it is. 

I feel exhausted. My hobbies mean nothing to me, they don't bring me joy. My body hurts. I have intrusive thoughts. I just want to stay in bed. I sleep hours and hours and yet I'm always tired. I wake in the night and can't get back to sleep. That's my depression. 

Since you're 17, I would recommend seeking help past your parents. I know it's scary but you can do it. There are tons of support groups for teens and young adults who struggle, there are online resources. 

I do fear for you because you think you need to take.harsh measures against your own body to get the attention of your parents, and by the sounds of things you're already self harming. 

I've been clean of self harm for about ten years now. What stopped me may very well not be what stops you. I know it sounds dumb, but to at least cut back I would recommend breathing exercises when you feel the need to self harm. I used an elastic band on my wrist for a little bit. It still hurt, but I wasn't cutting. Exercise helps more nowadays, just to help keep my mind off things. 

If you genuinely have thoughts of taking your own life, please reach out. Call a hotline. 

I don't know what I can say to make your parents listen. My mum at least listened after my school called and said I needed help. I'm not sure if you have any teachers or a school therapist you trust. But that's what got me the help I needed. 

I've been going on for a while but I'll say this again: the fact that you want help is good. I'm so sorry you're not getting the help you need and crave. I could have thrown any progress away if once I was in therapy I decided to not try. It was up to me to be proactive and work with my therapist to learn how to cope with my depression. 

Also as note (if you're in the US), if you have Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance therapy appointments are covered right now because of the pandemic at least through March. I actually just met a new therapist last week for the first time in 9 years.

Things you put effort into are important, they're an outlet, but if they're knocking you down instead of building you up, then they have to go on hiatus.

By limiting that voice that says you're not good enough or worth anything, you can start to learn to quiet it. I won't lie and say that's easy, because it really, really isn't. But it is something that's possible to do, and it's an important step in (hopefully) getting better. In time, you'd be able to return to those hobbies, and you'll be doing them primarily for enjoyment. You'll be able to be gentle with yourself and be happy about progress but not down on yourself because of a lack of it.

On another note, why do you feel like you're stopping people from having a good life? Why do you think the onus is on you to disappear? Either, these people care about you, in which case vanishing wouldn't be kind to them. Or, they don't care about you, in which case they're perfectly capable of removing themselves from *your* life.

Look, I'll say it again: you're 21. That's young. It makes your pain no less than if you were older, but what it does mean is that you have a hell of a lot of time to do something with your life, to make the most of new opportunities. Some people don't peek until they're past 50, even 60. If you regret those lost opportunites now, give yourself a chance to take the new ones. Volunteer at an animal shelter, or a charity store, or a soup kitchen.

Maybe, what you need right now is something that makes you feel useful. It's worth a try, isn't it?

And strange that I don’t get a rush from the meds, I am just so clear, brain fog and lack of motivation gone. As a result I can even clean, bath etc. I am now thinking of asking to be tested for ADHD. But I have gone about 4 days without taking the meds, my country has gone into a 21 day shutdown but I am still able to do a bit of planning for work, clean etc. I think finally saying I have been trying these antidepressants long enough and this disease is threatening everything that I was able to work hard for helped me even psychologically. I have been angry at the disease for years, but letting psychiatrist push meds that hurt me more that harm me made me feel powerless, hopeless and very angry. It’s my life, I know what works for me and what doesn’t. I don’t care if I have to keep trying short term solutions to be functional but what would be the point of losing everything and live miserably for the next 50 years.

I will make my treating physicians understand that their proposed treatments are making me worse. I go back on the 30th, because ADHD meds are highly regulated in my country, but I promised myself to advocate for my well being from now on. I will fight to stay on my current treatment until I feel it doesn’t work, then I will ask for something else. It’s been over 10 years of misery, I think I even started accElgin g feeling like crap all the time until I felt suicidal thoughts start to creep in.

Please, please sit down and try and remember the last time you felt happy or functional and then remind yourself that you deserve to be okay. We are not guinea pigs. Then  and question your treating physician if there is absolutely nothing they can do for you. In my worst moments I even suspected my psychiatrists of only caring about how often she can get me to come back only to tell me to be patient with meds that were making my problems worse.

The girl doesn’t make me angry.  I loved her.  It only brings pain.  How could it be her fault?   She was so good to me.

On the contrary, I think I have no energy because I’m depressive.  I don’t know what to do.  I don’t know how to allocate the little time I have left.

And for what it’s worth, I absolutely want to give up this time.  I don’t have a stick (no one relies on me) or a carrot (there’s no longer anything I want) to motivate me, nor do I feel like I’m operating under suspension of disbelief (I.e. I don’t think “everyone else is wrong” or that “it gets better” or that I’m denying myself a successful future by leaving now).

Could I be wrong?   Ive been wrong before.  But after 17yrs I think I have enough data to be confident in my opinion.  Regardless, bring it - what is it I’m supposed to do now?   I have no idea.  

Yeah I guess it’s good I wasn’t seeing my soulmate for so long. That would be devastating.  But I had my “dream career” for 10 years and that’s collapsed now too.  I loved this girl - she was so amazing - even though it was short that was maybe more devastating than my career.  

And what?   I can only control myself, well when do I know when I’m about to get backstabbed?   I don’t.  And when I get backstabbed, it appears the entire house of cards comes tumbling down.

One can always kill oneself but not resurrect from the dead. It's a bad thing to react so emotionally and heavily in such situations but of course that's easier said than done.  

He shouldn't let your mom control his life anymore. He's an adult and has an amazing sister. He's in the startingblocks of his life with you by his side and you have him. It's a bond that's so strong I as a single child cannot understand. It will never be broken. 

He needs to fight for himself. It can only get better if he makes it better, tackles his problems and has you by his side.

As someone who also is in the same line of thinking, I understand that simply giving sympathy often doesn't go too far. So I will keep it real with you and I hope it resonates well. I understand exactly how you feel and lately I have spending a lot of time alone and have been reflecting on my thoughts. I give myself an honest approach into acknowledging how I am feeling and why. A lot of times we feel this way because we are comparing ourselves to others. We see their progress (getting jobs, while we're stuck at home, making money, having family, having friends) and it just brings us down. When I think about the happiest people in my life, they're usually the ones who just don't really care. They are unapologetically themselves, and whenever an issue arises, instead of seeking for help from the world, they take the initiative to fix it themselves. I believe the same principle can be applied when we are in a dark place mentally. We often cry out for help and fall even deeper when we aren't receiving the same love back. I know how it feels. I know it hurts. But I truly believe you can do it, because it is absolutely possible. We grew up with this sort of mindset but we're capable of doing so much more. I feel like I lost all of my friends lately, and I feel as if I don't belong to society. Most of the time I'm just listening to other people share their success stories and build friendships from their commonality, and I feel left out. But that is absolutely okay. I am taking this time to work on myself and I know it's an uphill battle, but life is really fucking short.

Not everyone is cut out for university. ""The world don't need scholars as much as you think...(paraphrased from a Jason Mraz song)."" And it is true. We live in a class-fueled society that has made many people think if they don't get a degree they will never succeed; that is wrong. So what if you can recite Shakespeare... How does that help you at work? Education is important so you have more choices. I know plenty of people who have degrees and either ended up not working in that field or choosing to work in a kitchen or market or what is deemed a blue-collar job because they like it more. And then, some people get lucky and find a talent and make their living. doing that.

And working in a kitchen does not make you a loser. You might hate it now. I have seen and worked in some well-run, team-working kitchens and some total chaotic kitchens. It is honest, hard and often dirty work. And you don't have to do or be one thing your whole life.  You can change jobs every once in a while. Every experience teaches you something. 

So, you are not a loser. You are just lost. You might have depression and/or ADD. Sometimes, it is hard to see your way our of situations. I didn't start uni until I was 25. And frankly many of the classes I took were really not relevant to the workplace or even life in general. I truly think certifications and on the job training need to come back for this reason and the fact that some degrees are overrated and unnecessary and too expensive. ( At least in USA where people are paying on student loans for half their lives.)

It is up to you how you live your life. What if your parents were not around to help? What would happen to you? Think of what you would have to do for yourself to make it. Start with small goals. Get out of bed. at the same time each day. Make the bed. You will be less likely to get back in it. Then, make a short list of what needs to be done that day. Go for a walk. Greet a few people you see even if you don't know them. Try to help one person if you can whether it is holding a door open, carrying a bag, or whatever they need help doing. Little things add up.

This is 100% not to diminish anything that has worked for people who have commented so far. Just to clarify.

I'd see a therapist. There is nothing to lose by giving it a shot. Finding the right therapist is a bit like dating, you have to mesh with the person helping you.

The problem I had with going to friends and relying on them (and I dont know your age) but I am in my thirties now. My friends have lives, jobs, their own worries and problems. Spouses, kids and such. They cant just always be there for you at the drop of a hat and at a certain point if all you talk about with them is your issues, they just cant do that forever. 

Friendship is a two way street, if you just call them or message them only wanting to talk about your shit, well it gets old for them. Because you are not reciprocating it back.

That is what a therapist is there for, they dont expect that back. They are there to listen and help you.

Family, well that is something that is an individual basis. I do not know your family dynamic, mine would not and never was supportive or understanding.

Give it a shot, if you dont like it well then try something else. You wont know if it works for you unless you try.

I hope this doesnt come off the wrong way to people on here, i felt the same way towards therapy, but I feel a lot of people dont want it to work so they chalk it up to therapy doesnt work.

Ways they accept the world. If you’re born with less than the societal preference for sexual assets like height, looks, genital or breast size, etc then you end up feeling ashamed. Doesn’t have to be that way though. You’re not the only one who feels that way. 

Everyone wants to be accepted completely but there’s a certain beauty to learning in your life not to care about those things. While society’s current standard beautiful people might not learn those lessons until they are old and withered. You still have a whole life ahead of you with the early lesson that to enjoy your life to the fullest you’re gonna have to care less about everyone else’s acceptance and more about yours. There’s a million amazing hobbies out there and partners even if you feel as if you’re ugly. Just have to take it one step at a time and try to slowly adjust your mindset to caring less about that every day and more about how you will enjoy your life. It’s not an easy or fast process but waking up to it is the first step. Then take each little step you can until you’re living your own life.

I'm a 39F and 5'10.  I always stood out in a crowd and was always seen as attractive by peers and strangers. However, I was never told this at home.  My mother, who was very attractive, was raised by a mother that was extremely strict and shunned any form of vanity, and she passed that down to me.  Therefore my childhood wasn't very 'bright':  When I headed to grade school, I was seen as attractive to my peers, and my mother, though she was strict and shot down any compliments I would get regarding my looks, made sure I always was dressed very nice and fashionable. However, my Mom wouldn't let me do anything fun, especially things like going to parties or hanging with friends outside of my home.  This developed me into being very shy and awkward. I was always so scared and defensive when boys tried to talk to me flirtatiously, that I was seen as a bitch to most, and couldn't flow with the attractive popular girls.  So I was an outcast most of my school days.  A nerd myself, I would hang around fellow geeks, who also would from time to time reject me because I was WAY too codependent and would get pushed around alot by the popular girls. 

Whenever I tried to get a ""boyfriend,"" I would play that stupid game where I got my friend to tell a boy that I liked them, only to always get shot down because they would like my friend better because they were shorter. So I got my fill of rejection too.

So I enter adulthood, and because of my self esteem and codependency issues, I've been in two relationships that have destroyed my life.  The men in my life also thought I was beautiful, but that didn't stop them from treating me like shit too.

I asked my mom around the summer of 2018 to take me to a psychiatrist again because its when I'm having suicidal thoughts and my depression is only getting worse but she didn't instead we prayed (i don't like god but i do believe he is somewhere) i prayed and prayed but nothing happened. So i just kept my mouth shut. Then around october 2018 i accidentally brought a hangman noose or rope (wanted to show my best friend who's also depressed but I'm too dumb to think about the consequences and i showed the guard the wrong side of my bag so the school saw and confiscated it.
Fast forward the school contacted my mother and she came to school crying but still she didn't take me to any psychiatrist and also the school counselling stopped seeing me after a month.

I always had a bad relationship with my family but since I asked for help they are doin anything they can to help me .

I think u should start work on urself and the first step is talking about these things with someone who u trust,so I think that the best option is ur family.

There's nothing wrong to ask for help if u have anxiety or similar issues.

What if u had a different ""disease""? Would u not ask for help? .

I hope I expressed myself good cuz I don't speak end very well.

Be kind to urself, if u would look deep inside u, u would be amazed about what u are capable of.

The message fed to boys (males) for generations was that if you were a guy, you had to be tough, macho, keep a stiff upper lip... If you're life was going down the tubes, pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. Don't ever show you had any ""negative"" feels - were hurt, lonely, sad, down, scared, afraid, unsure, confused - showing or admitting you were ""weak"" (actually just fucking human) meant you were a less than, weak, a loser.... Or if you dared ask someone else to show you some TLC, give you a shoulder to lean on or a safe place to fall apart - you were just an emo self pitying poser... Or if that other was another dude, you must be an effeminate pansy or a predator using ""care about me"" as bait to reel them in so you could make a move on them. So your feeling is legit. 
Many folks ""care"". But most want to give advice on ""how to fix it"" - even though they've never been there. Part of them will try &amp; help, but when their kind words, encouragement &amp; assistance or whatever doesn't ""make it all or even a little better"" THEY become discouraged &amp; fade. There are a rare few folks who will legitimately care, but it takes quite a bit of perseverance to find those gems. The odd bent is, usually, those folks are actually folks who are just as broken as you yourself are. And they'll be just as gun shy to connect for fear of more loss, hurt &amp; pain. It's not an easy road. The ""hall time"" isn't pretty - in fact, life is neither fair or just. It honestly took me 50 years to find one such person. Today, he's my best friend. So....  It comes down to, do you believe you're worth it to work long &amp; hard to find one of those true friends.

My family does have health insurance but it's kinda crap when it comes to mental health, and my dad can't know about this under any circumstances so I don't think I'll be calling them. But I did try searching online and reached out to someone, just waiting on their answer now. As for the counselor part, the last time I told a counselor that I had a history of suicidal thoughts she immediately dropped me. I'd rather not go through that again and I just want to be very prepared for when my self harming tendencies come back in the summer (it always seems to happen in the summer, sometimes I'll get spikes in winter but idk it's rather strange.) I'm not in immediate danger now, but I will be soon. It's so confusing trying to sort through all the different licenses that therapists have and which therapists won't just drop me right away. If the person I reached out to doesn't respond then I'll just keep searching online. Someone I know has been in therapy for awhile and I've asked them where they found their therapist but they didn't really answer. Maybe I'll try asking this person again and hopefully they will have an answer.

[],,missll1406,,,[],,,,text,t2_a8voypmq,False,False,[],"I have completely failed my family -especially my mom. She does so much for me.   


I was retrenched in November 2020 and my mom has been the only one providing for our household. I took some loans to help with rent and utilities for December, but I could not take any more because I dpn't have a source of income.   


In December, my mom contracted the coronavirus (she is an essential worker) and she recovered okay but then had a setback 2 weeks later because she suffers from chronic asthma and the virus had taken its toll on her lungs. She has been hospitalized ever since because she cannot breathe without the assistance of a ventilator.   


With my mom being in the hospital, we (myself and my 3 younger siblings) have had no income and I was unable to pay our rent in January and February. I did a couple of freelance jobs and even signed up to transcribe for [Rev.com](https://Rev.com) (I am on the waiting list) but that literally only covers our groceries and public transport to get around to do these jobs wherever I can. I have applied for over 200 jobs over the last 3 months but nothing has come my way.   


My mom and I used to help out in our community - wherever there were families that needed assistance we'd make a couple of grocery hampers for them. Those families still need help and sometimes come to our house to ask for assistance but we barely have enough to eat ourselves so I have to say to them that we can't help and it breaks my heart so much because I know they will probably go to bed hungry.   


My mom does so much for me and now I cannot even take care of my siblings in her absence. I created a crowdfunding campaign on [GoGetFunding.com](https://GoGetFunding.com), but so far we've only received a donation of $5. I have reached out to everyone I possibly could reach out to and no one can help us. I have reached out to organisations, previous employers, even the college I studied at, but no one could help.  


We are officially being evicted tomorrow and it's my siblings' first day of school. I sold my cellphone last week to be able to buy their school supplies (not even all of it, we had to buy only the things that are essential at least for the first week or two). I am hesitant to sell my laptop because it may be the only thing that can actually provide me with a source of income and buying a new one would cost 5x the amount I'd get for this one.   


Like I said, we are officially being evicted tomorrow and I just don't see a way of getting $600 for our rent and utilities in 20 hours. I am done. I am numb. I am ready to jump off the nearest bridge. I don't know what position that would put my sisters in, but at least the $1000 funeral policy I have will pay out and hopefully cover the rent.  


The worst is, I was really getting better. I suffer from Anxiety and MDD- I have been on a streak of improved mental health for almost 7 months from May 2020 to January 2021, and now this. I feel like I'm in a big, black hole and I see no way of escaping. Trust me, I've had major financial dips and financial issues before - much bigger than this one, but for some reason this is hitting me so hard emotionally and mentally.

I think one thing that would really help would be to get on a more standard sleep schedule. It’s a proven fact that daytime sleep is less helpful than following your circadian rhythms. When I have a doctors appointment, the first thing she always asks me is how I’m sleeping. Sleep is critical to better mental health.

If that picture is what motivates you, stick with it. The good thing is it’s a picture of you so you’re doing it for yourself, you have got to want to get better for yourself before you do for anyone else. Anything else is a recipe for failure, regardless of how well intentioned it is.

I remember very little of my childhood, primarily by choice. I do know, however, that you have got to live in the moment, accept the feelings you are having, acknowledge them, and process them. Don’t put them in the past or in the future, as those cannot be changed in the case of the past, and cannot be predicted in the future.

For the potential alcohol issue of your father, you've got to remember it's not your fault, and you don't have to find a solution about it. If you have a fairly well relationship with your family, try to gather everyone and tell what you really feel and think about the whole situation.

A largish percentage of Covid sufferers are experiencing true depression for the first time. Some suffer with anger and irritability as well. All this to say not to discount that lingering effects of Covid could be contributing greatly to your depression.

Also at this once or twice a day thing along with the suicide note is thinking about self harm and how would I do it.

There were lots of cases when I caught myself pushing a razorblade onto my skin not trying to cut myself, just to feel some pain to make me feel like I actually did cut the skin.  It is my only prevention against self-harm. I don't want to kill myself only because I know what it would do to my family and friends.

Every 2 days some guy would say ""it won't drop anymore. Now's the time to buy"" and the main thread /r/cryptocurrency is the same way. There's barely any doubt that the coins will start going up again. I think they will too but I do have doubts. And then I think it'll crash, and that'll be it. Another 3 years of it dropping.  

Crypto used to give me purpose. Investing in it felt like I was doing a job. Arguing with either people who are unflinchable optimists or actual idiots.  

But losing it to a hack, and then laying in bed and not selling what I had left, made me really hit that depression stage. And realize I wasn't working.  

I've taken profits this time so I'm only ""playing with house money"" now. And I'll sell if it drops for multiple days in a row. If my crypto crash senses start tingling a bit more I'll get out.

Times/Dates, even if approximate, are a bonus. Additionally to this also get input from your parents and ask them to write down everything they recall too - the most important thing is to have solid, documented evidence. The more people you can involve, the better - some inpatient mental health units won't acknowledge accounts from patients and their families. 

Get your mental health team on this as well, asap. It might take some time to get everything documented  but it is worth it. The more medical professionals involved in addition to accounts from family members and yourself, you'll be more likely to get a response from the inpatient unit. 

Do you have any pictures of the events where you were injured by another patient? They would also be beneficial to supporting your formal complaint. The more evidence and documentation you have with your complaint, the more you'll force the inpatient unit's hand so they have to respond instead of not acknowledge it. 

When you've gathered enough documentation, and feel comfortable and supported, it might be worth considering taking this to a media outlet. However I would urge you to not do this immediately - it is easy for units like this to deny any of your experiences happening if they consider it to be an unsubstantiated claim.
