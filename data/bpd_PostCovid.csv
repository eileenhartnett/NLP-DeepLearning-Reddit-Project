However, I know a lot of therapists refuse to even consider diagnosing anyone under age 18 with BPD. So I was diagnosed with depression and cyclothymic disorder instead.

After my first semester of college I felt like I was losing my mind. My mental health was at the worst it‚Äôs ever been. I was first prescribed an antidepressant which triggered a whole different set of horrible symptoms (fuck Zoloft). My therapist then mentioned that she felt I was bipolar, and suggested that I should take mood stabilizers instead. So I was then prescribed a mood stabilizer (which didn‚Äôt end up helping at all and I weaned off of asap).

However! Even w/ her bipolar diagnosis, every single session she‚Äôd use BPD work books with me, would read me stories of those who have struggled with BPD to see if I could relate (I always did), and she would always say to me that I had ‚Äúborderline tendencies‚Äù. She made it obvious that she felt like I struggled with BPD but for some reason refused to just flat out say it. It sucked because I always wanted her to just validate what seemed to be the big hard truth. That never happened and I stopped seeing her because she was just not the right therapist for me. 

What upset me the most was that I clearly struggled with BPD not bipolar disorder and I was still prescribed to take mood stabilizers to treat the bipolar disorder that I don‚Äôt even have.

Someone who didn't walk on eggshells with them (I still had to a little to not trigger them, but I didnt show it and was always open and honest) and would forgive them when they said things they'd come to regret.

I was never leading them on. I don't think relationships that end mean nothing. That time and those memories are still precious.

a typical day consists of waking up around 7:30/8am, drinkin coffee, working for a few hours, having my one class, then going back to work. it‚Äôs a nice schedule and i enjoy working from home.

i‚Äôm in a serious relationship of 1.5 years, currently long distance but closing the gap in august. my bpd causes issues, but we always manage to reflect and improve on them.

i was always ‚Äúhigh functioning‚Äù but have had periods of being low functioning for sure. i was in therapy twice a week and have been working on being sober (alcohol and drugs make my brain so much harder to deal with). i drink very rarely (trying to stop) and smoke weed maybe once a month. i‚Äôm now trying to get a good workout routine going and eat healthier! it‚Äôs hard though. 

my advice is: try to remove the things in your life that cause unnecessary pain (suffering). for me, that was drugs and alcohol, junk food (i used to struggle with binge eating disorder), etc. it‚Äôs very very difficult and i have yet to rid myself of my toxic vices, but i have hope it will get easier with time.",,1590631288,{},fs1mowr,False,t3_grue8x,False,True,t3_grue8x,/r/BPD/comments/grue8x/calling_all_highfunctioning_folk_with_bpd/fs1mowr/,1590639582,1,True,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,0,[],,,,,

However, my ultimate career of choice is a special education teacher (specifically with aggressive/""severe"" students) so I am currently pursuing a teaching degree. Overall, I **love** it. I feel the most confident and secure when I am working, I know I am good at it and I know students love me and I love them. Day to day, however, it varies. Sometimes coworkers will be irritating or the day won't go as expected and I have to fight my desire to control everything. 

+ Typical day is hard to say because Covid-19 threw everything in the trash. Pre-Covid, I'd take my kid to school and go to work. Then pick kid up, help with kid's homework, then sit down at the computer for my homework. Eventually dinner and family time. Mostly a homebody but occasional BBQs/activities with friends and infrequent concerts or nights out. 
Covid-19 typical day is taking my partner to work and coming home to spend all day with said kid. Make sure to work out, stay as productive as possible so I don't have time to spiral, etc. Therapy once a week. 

+ Yes, I am in a committed long-term relationship. I'd consider it the *healthiest* relationship I have ever had. It still has flaws but I'd say that tons of communication, a lot of quality time, and both of us deciding we *choose* each other through everything. We love each other as if it were a verb. We actively decide to work through things, support each other, and develop healthy boundaries. 

+ **Hell no I was not always high-functioning and I'd even say due to Covid-stress, I'm struggling to maintain that high-functioning lifestyle.** I had to work for it. Hard. Years of therapy, medication, psychedelic experiences, determination to improve my life. 

+ Biggest piece of advice? It is a two-part piece. 1. Do the work. Honestly. Do the therapy, try meds if they are suggested, buy the workbooks, do it every day. Pretend you are studying and keep practicing everything you learn. Do. The. Work. 2. Find something to be truly passionate about that is not a relationship. I found that with my job.

I still feel awful but this has helped me cope.

I can't keep jobs for long once people know I am transgender, autistic and BPD, DID, and have psychosis episodes/mania. I don't drive and I always feel trapped by being jobless and unable to drive.

My plan of escape is to live in a trailer and buy a truck, I started working ! It's online through [writers.work](https://writers.work) on [writers.org](https://writers.org) and I get paid to write about things I like! I can make $100-$300 in just one day of writing two articles around 1,500 words each. I plan on sneakily getting a license but keeping my driving to a minimum. I'll continue trying to get a degree in literature, and make money teaching, writing and making Ebooks. Keeping my life as chill as possible has really helped with my BPD! Once I get that trailer I am sure I will have more peace from living in a crowded home of poverty, animal shit everywhere and crowded abusive family.

I am 19, I struggle with suicidal intentions everyday and a rollercoaster of emotions, but living alone in a trailer and choosing who I visit and when, is really going to help me.

I just wanted to point out that this feels a bit like advanced guidance tho, at least from where I started and where OP might be.

So just to build on all the great things you pointed out: 

maybe start with small financial goals, with the idea more than anything, to gain full financial independence. Check off, savings goals, debt elimination goals, functioning car goals etc. working at a bar isn‚Äôt the end all, its definitely not minimum wage (Been in the industry my whole working life) but it definitely means you have to tighten up finances (which is hard with BPD). The big point being, you don‚Äôt need to flex or have super nice things to have financial security that‚Äôs sexy AF to woman.

I think the passion part was also notable, I remember having passion for seemingly everything, so much so it was like I didn‚Äôt have passion for anything.... if that hit any chords with you. Try and focus on what it is that just draws you, deep down, even if it‚Äôs the thing you think isn‚Äôt even worth it (ie: my ‚Äúdumb‚Äù baseball hobby is now a full time blog position)..

Differentiating the two ends up being an argument about how we define two words that essentially mean the same thing. I can't think of a situation where something we be someone's fault and not there responsibility, vice versa; I guess it might come into play with legal concerns, but law has very distinct and concrete phrasing and I'm not digging into those weeds. I'll just say that responsibility in this context, is an easy way to define who gets punished for what. 

I've always believed mental illness/disorders are very different from other illnesses. I don't think automatically assigning responsibility without context is worth the simplicity. Psych has often used responsibility and comparisons as ways to destigmatize, but I'm honestly not sure how effective of a strategy that is. In my experience, many of those who don't deal directly with mental illness, and even some that do, still have very strong prejudice and judgements towards certain behaviors and diagnoses. 

Psychiatry is very much a field that evolves with the social dynamic. Psychiatry as it is today is quite different from traditional medicine, and it's nature may keep it that way. The lines are far from defined and I don't necessarily feel comfortable making a blanket statement.

I don't think I've ever done anything that I shouldn't be held responsible for, but I've been in enough mental health units to tell you that there are a lot of people out there who have been in states where their responsibility just isn't as clear as we would like to believe.",,1596508563,{},g0abc3j,False,t3_i2n5tn,False,True,t1_g09pzaw,/r/BPD/comments/i2n5tn/i_know_this_is_irrational_but/g0abc3j/,1596517806,1,True,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,0,[],,,,,

I've always struggled when trying to challenge my instincts and automatic thoughts. When I think of my FP, I find it incredibly difficult to separate the past from the present. I commend you for staying open to change.

I talked to my therapist today and I mentioned some of the things that have come up, I think I can say for sure that I'm still pretty unsure about what constitutes selfish or irrational behavior, and what might be considered a healthy expectation. When I talk about personality disorders and ""normative"" personalities/thinking/behavior, I tend to be overly pressed about deep philosophical meaning, and I think that might overly complicate the decision process. All that overthinking likely contributes to the dense monlogues. I tend to believe that the way we phrase things can reveal a lot about our internal beliefs. I guess this paragraph provides some context to how I choose what to point out. 

As I understand things so far, you seem very worried that you'll smother him with your needs, causing him to cut you off. In addition to this, you believe that it's irrational to have such expectations of this relationship. Those concerns add to the difficulty of voicing your feelings to him, but for you it's comforting to believe that he would understand how you feel and reciprocate similar to how you felt he's done in the past. You also believe that his needy/demanding girlfriend isn't particularly fond of him discussing his needs, whether emotional or otherwise, with you. Previous to this you stated that you believe your relationship with him is filling a void in both of your lives and this was on display when you visited him. You would hate to end up being as unfufilling as his current girlfriend. 

As an outsider who only owns broken records, I can't help but point out my belief that you're keeping an ideal image of this relationship on life support. The things you feel are 100% valid,  and I don't think you should feel guilty about your need for attention and support, but I personally feel as though you might be exaggerating your role in his life. I'm saying this because I'm focused on how you've described your ability to be the fulfillment he's missing. Whether it be the fulfillment of the weeks you had together, or the idea that your providing him something his needy girlfriend can't. Forbid you ever be as demanding as her, then you might be kicked to the curb. I'm not saying that you don't bring positive emotions, I'm just wondering if you, let alone any one person, could be just what he needs, vice versa. For me the feeling of losing the person of my dreams has always been very closely tied to my need to be dreamt of. I think it's worth considering if the loss/changing of this relationship is actually as dreadful as you worry it might be, and whether your need for the relationship is more about him individually or the broader appeal of getting all your needs met in one familiar and comfortable person. 

I've been tiptoeing around it but I've always found that my relationship with my favorite person was ruined because specifically because she was my favorite person. I expected that my need for her also meant that she very much needed me in the same way. The magic wasn't just because she took care of me, I felt like I did the very same for her.

This sounds like a totally lopsided relationship to me. I mean I'm sure he's made mistakes and hurt people before, right? Or is he some flawless superhuman being?

I absolutely agree on the acceptance part. I thought about that too, right after posting, so good catch! 

Also, you saying that no matter what happens the marriage has ""functionally ended"" at this point was very true and well said.

The amount of care, respect and love we have for one other is undeniable... and I think that is my hold up, I think that's what won't allow me to accept or let go and try to move on. There is still so much there, and the only reason he isn't open to trying on things (yet or ever) is he needs time to fully heal and be able to determine if he feels rebuilding trust is even possible. I really struggle with not being able to have any influence over that by showing him I have been making changes for the better. I keep believing once he sees that he will be able to trust again. But time keeps passing without me being able to see him and shoe him this which is only adding distance to our otherwise strong connection. That's what hurts most.

Because you know what? I hold myself accountable to the exact same standards that I expect from everyone else. I don‚Äôt expect anything from anyone else that I don‚Äôt practice myself.

Because guess what‚ÄîI would *never* check my watch when someone was talking to me, even if I don‚Äôt really care to talk to them. I strive very hard to make sure everyone I encounter is treated with respect and that they are validated. I do that with even people I hate. That‚Äôs just the way I am. 

Even if I was short on time, I would probably end up being late to wherever it is I had to be just for their sake. And then if I absolutely had to go, I would wait for the best time to delicately tell them I had to leave.

Don‚Äôt you see? I have a very high ideal of how human interaction should play out. And if I‚Äôm the event that I‚Äôm less than perfect or make some kind of faux pas? You can bet your ass I‚Äôll punish myself with guilt. Because guess what, I‚Äôm a good person. I‚Äôm a wonderful person actually who deep down has intense empathy for others. And it would literally bother me for days or weeks if I offended someone. 

But the tragedy of BPD is that almost no one can reciprocate this intense empathy. So that is why we come unglued. Or that is why I come unglued at least.

Because I‚Äôm outraged by people‚Äôs selfishness and superficiality. 

The incredible thing about this ‚Äúdisorder‚Äù is that my intuition is usually always spot on. 

If I sense that someone is not a good person or I observe that they behave in hurtful ways, when all is said and done I‚Äôm usually right.

People have told me before that my ability to read them is uncanny. I can smell deceit and malice 100 miles away. 

So if you ask me, the only people in this world who are not bothered by such things are offenders themselves. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",,1599449872,{},g4ar1bs,False,t3_inndzg,False,True,t3_inndzg,/r/BPD/comments/inndzg/someone_should_create_a_youtube_video_where_its_a/g4ar1bs/,1599449883,1,True,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,0,[],,,,,

Group therapy was great because that is where you are taught most of the empirically proven skills of DBT. You get to listen to other people‚Äôs experiences with BPD, you get to share your stories if you‚Äôd like, and you get to learn the best skills to use for certain stressful situations. 

In individual therapy, it‚Äôs all about you and you get to talk about whatever you‚Äôd like! Every week you can talk about certain events that were problematic for you in the past week, and your therapist works with you to find the best solutions for the future. 

The program is a 20 week program and you can cycle back through it until you and your therapist feel you are ready to graduate! 

DBT is a very good therapy and is one of the most successful therapies for a personality disorder. DBT clients have a very high rate of recovery (although it is a long process). 
Also, BPD success has been shown to persist and continue even after DBT is over. 

And to answer your question about what I‚Äôve learned‚Äî-More than you could imagine! You are taught so so so many different skills for different situations. You also gain an insane amount of perspective if you really work hard at understanding the DBT material. 

In DBT, you are taught how to grow. If you work hard at it, you succeed. No matter how long that wait list is, DBT is a life changing therapy and whether you get in it in a few months or a year, it‚Äôs 1,000% worth it since you will carry your knowledge with you for the rest of your life.",,1599442004,{},g4aen0s,False,t3_inxwmv,False,True,t3_inxwmv,/r/BPD/comments/inxwmv/experiences_with_dbt_therapy_and_or_other/g4aen0s/,1599442015,1,True,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,0,[],,,,,

I know you probably don't need my rambling or platitudes (even though I genuinely do mean them). As for solutions, I know that for me, its been incredibly important to learn how to live life for myself. I know that I need to be an active participant in making my life better, making choices that scare me and challenge me. For example, my top priority now is moving out of my hometown.

What I do know is that you're strong enough to get through this. There's a light at the end of the tunnel that will make all this suffering worth it, and you deserve to get there. 

I'm probably not in a position to offer much advice, as I'm not exactly in control of my life or illness atm. However, I do think the right course of action is to reach out for help.  This could be in the form of a hotline (I prefer text hotlines personally because I'm so anxious about calling) or from maybe finding a new therapist? 

Learning the same coping skills over and over I know can be frustrating. It may be beneficial to join a group therapy program where you can relate with people who understand first hand what you're going through.

My parents separated when I was 9 due to my mum having an affair (i'm 39 now), she just put us in the car one day and she said ""we're moving to a new house!""  I asked if dad would meet us there and she said no, he wasn't coming and it destroyed me.

I moved in with my grandmother when I was 15 to escape. In the years in between I suffered emotional and physical abuse. My father trying to kill himself several times, emotionally blackmailing us to get info on my mum. My mum got my younger brothers to change their surname to her maiden name but I refused. She's hit us in the balls, break my fingers by grabbing them and pulling them back.She once pinned me against a wall by the throat until I blacked out and also punched me in the face. I was expected to be the man of the house, mowing an acre of lawns every week, making and clearing out the fire, looking after my younger brothers.  Having her tell me that my dad was a no good piece of shit, a wife beater etc and then she' sit there and say ""your brothers are definitely 'her maiden name' but you're a 'dads surname' through and through"", so she was saying I was just like him.  She stole all my life savings when I was 10 to buy a car to get us around, it wasn't a lot, we weren't well off and the years I was there we had nothing.  if it was today we'd be using food banks. She had 5 kids in total, all boys, and the last one was after I moved out. From 12 to 15 I had to sleep on our living room floor as we didn't have the space or money for an extra bed. 

When I moved out i still had issues with both parents, like that I borrowed ¬£30 from her boyfriend as i was just a little short from buying a PC.  I told him I'd pay him back by X date which he was fine with, and 5 days before X she broke into my room and stole the PC as I hadn't paid him. Dealing with my dad being abusive towards his girlfriends, hitting one then trying to kill himself. One time it was pouring petrol over his then girlfriend while she was in the bath and threatening to lit them on fire while her 3 young daughters where asleep in the house.

At 15 I fell in love and my now wife's family kind of took me in, I spent more time there than at my grandmothers.  Even now, I see my dad once or twice a year, when he comes round for my kids birthdays or to drop Christmas presents off. My mum, maybe 4 or 5 times a year, when she comes to see the kids.  She's not the same person she was but still, I don't feel close to either of them. It bothers me more about my dad, he didn't have a choice in it when my mum left and he was always a great dad, never hit us, he lived for his family. I watch things like Forrest Gump and he finds out he's a father and is worried about the kids and i shed a tear because I lost my childhood and I lost my dad. I'll never be able to get that relationship back, I didn't even invite him to my wedding at the time as my mum was coming and I can't have them bother together as there is always drama. My mum teases him as he still loves her, even after 30 years apart. 

All of that and more are why I have BPD, and depression, my autoimmune disease is genetic, my dad has Psoriasis. 

Looking back BPD was obvious in my teenage years and early 20's, how my wife has put up with me for the last 20+ years I don't know. In my early 20's it was smothered with depression. I lived my life as normal, but no one was aware I had depression. It wasn't until my early 30's that it all came out after some really bad choices I had made. I promised my wife i'd get help and I did.  First with the depression, a short run or sertraline and a shit ton of mental will power and I managed to break free from depression, but as soon as that went, the BPD came pouring out of me. Self harm had always been a part of me, 1 suicide plan in my early 30's which I didn't go through with, anger, hatred, pain, every shitty thing you can feel. 

But, I spoke with gp's, I learnt to understand my past, my present, my feelings and mental health and as my wife says, i'm so much better than the person I used to be.

I regret losing my 20's and early 30's to that crap but I've learnt that keeping all those negative feelings and thoughts in my life did nothing but make my life shit. I use my experiences to talk to others, and by it's no means the worst things people can go through it show things can get better, but it was on me to get myself better.

I don't carry hate any more for anything that's happened to me, all it does is make me feel like crap, it doesn't effect the people that I hated. Why punish myself for them? I've not forgotten the abuse, I've not even forgiven them, but I'm not going to give anymore of my life to them but hating them. I've a small 3 bed house, a marriage to girl I've loved for 23 years and 3 kick ass kids. 

I don't want people to feel sorry for me, I am who I am because of everything I've been through, it's allowed me to hopefully help other people. I am very open about it all, secrets make us sick and sharing is caring. My wife didn't understand when I posted on Facebook that I'd be diagnosed as having depression. But the feeling of being open about it, not having secrets or to worry about people finding out was amazing. Even better, I had people commenting saying they had depression too but hadn't been brave enough to talk about it, I had strangers messaging me thanking me as they'd seen a mutual friend comment and it had encouraged them to seek help. 

You've been through the shit, but it's up to you if you want to stay there. You've young, how I'd love to be 21 again knowing what i know now. Try being open about what you're feeling, write it down, it helped me.  Imagine writing a book on your life, talk about it, even if you don't know how, once you start it can just flow out of you. You could even write to your parents, even if they never see it, it can help get your words and emotions out. Use your experiences to help others, it really is the best medicine. I'd advise you speak to a doctor about the meds as well, and coming off them if they aren't helping any more. Move away from the town if you feel the need to.   we don't have to stay where we are, we can move on, make changes.

I really do wish you all the best and I hope you can resolve whatever is giving you nightmares. You're not at fault for how your parents treated you, it's not your fault your bipolar ex abused you. You can be the person you want to be, we all just have to learn how to let go of that anchor that holds us back :)",,1602386720,{},g8f9pz4,False,t3_j8wmxt,False,True,t1_g8f2b41,/r/BPD/comments/j8wmxt/i_can_feel_that_my_death_is_near_everyday/g8f9pz4/,1602393726,1,True,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,0,[],,,,,

I thought opioids are for physical pain?  I didn't think they did anything for mental well being.

I have BPD and an autoimmune disease called Psoriatic Arthritis. My immune system attacks my own body and as a result of this, it causes immense pain, like bones being broken over and over again. I was on sulfasalazine to manage it but had to come off when we were trying for a baby so the doctors gave me codeine and told me to take it with paracetamol. 

Honestly, I know what they can do to the body, I know how addictive they can be and unless I needed them to get out of bed and do something I lived with the pain because it's not worth the risk.  I've seen people get addicted to them and what happens when they get used to them, so I chose not to.

I mean that in a way of, I'll think of this thing, this kernel, and then want to see how other people experience it. And as I'm writing up a post I'll actually dredge up my true feelings on it, and it's quite helpful. It might come out as ramblings that make little sense to some, and might even feel embarrassing to post. But at that point I might have totally resolved my feelings on it and no longer even want to engage with the replies. That might seem rude, or counterproductive, but for me it actually manages a whole heap more than just never posting that thing. Someone else might see it or the replies and relate and have a positive take away.  

Where I'm going with this I don't know. I guess I wanted to say that I don't necessarily have any issue interacting here from my own perspective. It's a useful pseudo self therapy in a lot of ways, and I think if someone wants to post something that they think might not fit they should do it anyway. If even one person sees that and benefits from it, or one person replies to the benefit of the OP, that is worth it. People here seem pretty damn welcoming and friendly. I hope most won't be afraid to post. I'm kinda new here, but I try to now and then go beyond just the front page to those more barren threads, or go to /r/BPD/comments and just take a gander at recent thoughts and jump in. When I can of course, when I have something hopefully useful to add (which ain't necessarily that often).

Of course you're right that there's a lot of negativity that tends to cloud the front page. A lot of CWs. Also a lot of common posts. But it's a tricky pickle, because presumably you'd never want to discourage people reaching out when they're really struggling, even if their issue has been posted 5 times that day, or 50 times that week. We're all dealing with it, and we all want the best for each other.

But on the other hand a format like this is cool because unlike a discord, there's tens or hundreds of streams of discussion at once (unless you have a monstrous number of channels or something). So I think despite what it might seem, there's actually a net positive effect of having less one-dimensional discussions and topics. 

I did have one thought a while back on how to improve discussion for discussion's sake, which would be to contest mode all threads (or maybe all threads with some particular flair). That way any new visitor to a thread will get a mostly random and fresh batch of comments and maybe Jimmy Latecomment at the bottom will get some replies too. But I appreciate that it does perhaps stunt the threads a bit in other ways. And that it comes back to the whole show karma vs don't show karma saga. 

Maybe another way is to have a ""something saturday"" or a ""topic tuesday"", where there's a sub wide encouragement of posting a more focused set of topics/content. But how to decide on that, I don't know. And I guess the DAE stickies are kinda like that.


This is pretty long. Not sure I ever even reached a point in this, but, yeah. I mean there's &gt;100k subs here. That's honestly a huge number, and the concurrents are huge too. It's understandable that with a disorder with such a massive variety of combinations of symptoms and types that it's hard to necessarily find some sort of common thread. I think y'all's doing purdy gurd even with these issues. :) Thanks for this haven.

With the friends who are good at reaching out, I think the reasons they find it worthwhile to do so to me are either that I'm doing more of the heavy lifting in some other aspect of the relationship, or I'm otherwise providing something especially valuable to them.

I used to get really really jealous all the time, it caused many problems in the relationship and I'm surprised she didn't leave me back then. Even now, looking back some of my behaviour was very BPD over the top behaviour but I had no idea what it was then. 

There's nothing wrong with being a bit ott in love when it first starts, but that will change. it mellows over time, it becomes less intense and more comfortable.

What I will say is, if anything is going to end your relationship then chances are it's going to be your jealousy. I was lucky in that she hung around but the majority of people wouldn't. 

What I will say is, he will find other women attractive, and you'll find other men attractive, that's ok. It's ok to flirt with other people, have friends of the opposite sex and will go and do things with them.  That is all ok and doesn't mean you or he will cheat on each other. 

The sooner you can start to understand that, the easier you'll find your jealousy. I know it's easy to say but seems like climbing Everest blindfolded with your arms behind your back but it is worth working at. I am covered in scars where I've cut myself to deal with my wife going out drinking with her friends. In my late teens early 20's I'd hurt myself and pretend that I'd been attacked or something to try and get her sympathy to stay with me and not go out. 

I'm thankful it didn't work, and things like that still bother me now, I'm just better at dealing with it, and also hiding it and not letting her know.  It's not her fault I can't deal with it and if I want her to be happy I have to accept she needs these things in her life. 

I had a BPD friend who actually installed spyware onto his girlfriend's mobile phone so he could track her and listen in when she went out. That was until the app banned him due to the amount of time he was using it.  The thing was, it actually made him more paranoid and when he was banned he found it easier to deal with. Very odd, but maybe try and stop checking his social media, it could help with the jealousy.  

You need to find a way of coping that works for you.

[],,BigUncleJimbo,,,[],,,,text,t2_61rcnfhk,False,False,[],"Yeah, Borderline Personality Disorder sounds like you're just *RIGHT* on the border of having a personality lol It *is* a strange name for it. It doesn't help that it shares the same acronym with Bi-Polar Disorder. When the friend I am closest with told me they had BPD I thought they meant Bi-Polar Disorder for like a week until they realized and explained it to me.

I get what you mean about so many possible disagnoses (and some with very similar symptoms, and some that overlap with others.) It's a lot to take in and come to terms with. 

And even though BPD is so villianized for some reason, it's nothing to be ashamed of. You didn't choose to have this disorder and you've been brave enough to admit something is wrong and seek out help and tell therapists or psychologists who were basically strangers some very secret stuff about yourself. That takes a lot of heart. You should be proud that you are working on improving your life even though it's scary and sometimes maybe embarassing too.

I think you should try to tell some of the people you are closest with more about it. Sending them an article might be a good idea. That's exactly what my friend did when I didn't know anything about it and it helped me understand a lot very quickly. From there I started doing my own research about it, but at first I think they sent those articles so they knew I wasn't reading one of the many negative articles out there.

Maybe not all your friends are that close to you, maybe some don't care or don't believe in mental disorders or whatever. But there are probably some who would be very interested to understand you better. Even if you only think 1 or 2 people close to you would be understanding and interested in learning more, it would be good to have someone in your life who could be there for you at times like these.

If you can gather your courage to talk with them about it, you can just ask them if they'd be willing to read an article or 2 about it and if they say yes you can choose some links that don't treat BPD like it's a sign of The Anti-Christ. 

And hopefully those who you choose to discuss it with will be there for you a bit more often. If you should end up getting pink slipped again maybe they'd notice or wonder how you are doing after a couple of days without contact. I think some of them would probably be helpful if they knew you needed some help. Check up on you and offer to talk and stuff like that.

So I hope you'll consider opening up to at least a couple of them and see how it goes. I know that sometimes my friend feels like a big burden and you know what, sometimes they are. But not a burden I want to stop carrying when they need me to. We've only gotten closer since I learned what was going on with them. They used to always say how alone they felt but they haven't said that in a very long time. That's a burden worth bearing as far as I'm concerned. I bet some of your friends would feel the same way.

And thank you! I am doing pretty good lately!

Good luck! Keep working at it and this will get easier and easier. Progress might be slow but it will also be steady if you put your heart into it. It's a tough diagnosis for sure but it's not impossible or hopeless. Believe in yourself!

I was really confused on what was considered normal and what was out of ordinary, and it was really difficult for me to distinguish if what I was experiencing was actually abnormal. As a result, I'm pretty sure I toned down a lot of my answers when filling out the surveys. I was afraid that I would answer with stronger responses to confirm my bias of having some kind of mental illness. 

And since I toned down the answers so much, I got no diagnoses. They told me they thought I had relationship problems, which made me feel terrible. I thought to myself, ""If there's nothing wrong with me other than myself, then I must be a failure of a human."" 

Later on I met with my therapist, and technically since she has to diagnose me to treat me, I did talk about diagnoses with her. I also met with a psychiatrist and got prescribed meds for my symptoms, even though I didn't get ""officially"" diagnosed aside from my therapist. If you're feeling insecure about the diagnoses, remember it's possible to still get treated and diagnosed by your therapist.

It seems like a lot of people online do idealize that dependence on another person (much like we idealize people, I guess!) and think that finding someone good enough will fill that empty space pwBPD often feel. In the long run, though, it ends up hurting us and the people we give that responsibility.

In a way, I get why the relationship is a draw -- for me, when I was at my worst, that external validation kept me going so I didn't have to confront all of the scary things that were waiting if I turned my attention inward. It's like an addiction; the temporary high you get is enough to keep you out of those dark places, even if you *know* it could eventually destroy you. I think that's also why it's so hard for people with FPs to pull out of that cycle.

I think it's important to acknowledge that those relationships exist for a reason. We're looking to meet *some* need with it, and something (I think mostly not being taught the skills we need) prevent us from filling that need within ourselves. I know for me, realizing that, and realizing there had to be a healthier way to get the validation and love I was seeking, was huge in recovering from needing that FP. There was a terrible adjustment period in cutting off my last FP relationship, but I've been amazed by how much growth I've experienced in the two years since then.

Based on how you've described your approach to partners consuming porn, you are conscious that your bother at his viewing it just once is rooted in deep fear of rejection and abandonment: something folks like us know all too well.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that, in calling his viewing porn a ""mistake"" -- after having been so self-aware in the paragraphs above -- you are actually lending some credence to the exact thoughts which you need to be viewing as red flags and as irrational.

When folks who have stable baselines use a word like ""mistake"" in this context, they usually mean that someone made an error but life moves on, and so long as there was open communication it probably was in hindsight accidental. When we use ""mistake,"" however, we tend to actually add a subtle layer of control: the fact that your boyfriend did not listen to your demand regarding porn-watching must mean that he isn't attracted to you, so you have to find a way to either reel him back in or spit him out (a process I suspect you've grappled with).

In a ""normal"" relationship dynamic, these issues are not uncommon, either. It is not rare for partners to slip up when it comes to properly showing affection and attraction. These slip ups could be called mistakes. If a wife and husband have spoken about not commenting on the attractiveness of strangers, but the wife slips up and comments about how someone she saw on the street had really nice eyes: in 9/10 marriages, the husband might remind his wife of their mutual boundary, and the wife would likely try to show extra affection the next day, mindful of the husband's feelings in this area.

But we're in the 1/10 scenario, and we would overreact -- like with your partner's succumbing to porn *one* time. It's great that you're aware about how your emotions can betray you, so I think the next step might not to conceptualize what your husband did as a ""mistake."" It just adds an unnecessary layer of tension to what is already a tense dynamic owed by this awful disorder.

Yes because this isn't a game played on an app for points, for likes, for upvotes, for messages to feed one's ego, for one-upmanship. This is real shit. Forget the exact situation of OP's for a second, my statements have only ever been general here, and for good reason. Having been the product of a dogcunt relationship between two people (that started with simple manipulative tactics - like those mentioned -  and regress into attempted suicide and attempted murder), I can say first hand that not taking this shit seriously when you have the chance, or intentionally flying in the face of it, can lead not only to your own suffering, but the suffering of others, the other party, your relatives, your friends, your offspring, etc.       

&gt;You can think it‚Äôs manipulative if you want but i bet if you make yourself too available to a guy he‚Äôs going to lose interest in you.   

I don't have to think. I know it is. And this is one of those presumptive, biased statements I was talking about.   

&gt;Bottom line is, she needs to have things that she is doing for her own life so when he doesn‚Äôt text her back right away, she won‚Äôt even notice and when he texts her, she won‚Äôt be so ready to text back.  

I never argued that. In point of fact that was my exact, very carefully worded, explicit meaning. Live for yourself and your own happiness, but do not self-obsess and do not necessarily self-isolate. Do no harm to others. If you cannot find happiness in yourself you will sure as shit not find it in others for long. I know that sounds intensely self-righteous, but is that not ultimate emotional and general independence?        

&gt;If he‚Äôs purposely ignoring her, why would you advice that she gives him attention right away? That‚Äôs bad advice. 

Despite the presumptions, I would love for you to point out where I advised that, but you won't be able to, because I never did. 

&gt;You must be a person who makes themself too available and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre defending this so hard.  

Please don't presume to know a damn thing about me but what I've written here.   

&gt;TAKE YOUR TIME TEXTING HIM BACK IF HE TAKES HIS TIME. Simple.

I even dated a rapist and almost married him and of course got abused. Then I met a guy who I think I genuinely loved, but I screwed it up. I was so afraid it would end, I couldn‚Äôt be myself around him. I didn‚Äôt know why at the time, but I scared him into thinking I had a severe medical condition, probably because I was subconsciously testing to see how much he cared about me. Anyways, he ended it, and I always blamed myself. I‚Äôve always had a dismal outlook since then. Fast forward a few years, I keep trying to find new guys. But I slowly started becoming aware of my cycle: idealizing and then things quickly falling apart, and I‚Äôve slowly been losing faith in relationships. It gets harder and harder to trust my feelings. Sexual drive has been declining as well.

Most recently I dated an amazing guy. He actually loved me, and he told me that. That was a first for me. He probably would have put up with my shit. And then he said something about what he wanted for his future kids, and I didn‚Äôt want the same thing, and I just spun into freak out mode. I didn‚Äôt say anything to him, I just quietly freaked out inside. And then my brain just completely disassociated from him. We stayed together for months after that and I hoped I would come back around. But I never started feeling anything again and we ended up breaking up because of it. I felt nothing during or after the break up. I still feel nothing for him. And since then I haven‚Äôt felt anything romantic for anyone at all. It‚Äôs been since May that I lost all romantic feeling. I think my brain gave up and completed disassociated from all hope of a stable relationship.

I still feel joy, pity, sadness, anger... but no love. I don‚Äôt even love my pets. It feels like they‚Äôre roommates. I can‚Äôt connect to anything anymore. I think it‚Äôs just a complete loss of hope that I can connect to other people/things.

I‚Äôm trying to rekindle that flame by doing/watching things that remind me of the life I wanted when I was younger. I used to like interior design and emotional family shows (think TLC), so I‚Äôve been finding modern versions of that stuff. We shall see if it helps.

[],,BordAsperg,,,[],,,,text,t2_7f165qj4,False,False,[],"I've tripped numerous times, but I can say that the process of tripping, although very similar for most, is also very intimate and unique to the individual experiencing the trip. I've had a lot of good trips and some bad ones as well. In my personal experience, I've found it easier to control my emotions and to walk away from bad thoughts on psychedelics, but this wasn't always the case. Out of 29 times using psychedelics, there were some occasions where the trip became a little more ""out of my hands,"" if you will, but that didn't happen too often. 
I don't think that one should do psychedelics without first doing some research on the compounds in question (i.e. how they work, what medications they may interact with negatively, what a person may experience while high on said compound [the experience is actually pretty ineffable, so its impossible to describe in its entirety], and specific safety precautions). 
Psychedelics can increase the serotonin in the brain for a month or more, which can elevate your mood, but the thing to watch out for is the fact that that can play a role in inadvertently putting someone who has bipolar into a manic state, albeit a hypomanic state, if that. 
I would suggest research, research, research. If you want to do something like this, you need to be sure that it is something that you feel ready for, and that you are open.
If one were to begin having a bad trip, however, my best advice: surrender. Give in. If they don't fear it, its no longer scary. Everything they'd be seeing would be coming from them, so if they surrender, there won't be the friction of them fighting what happens to be distressing them during the trip; it should begin to flow smoothly again.
Best of luck. I hope some of this can help you, or that it at least answered your question somewhat.",,1611201533,{},gk0ydlw,False,t3_l1p1o9,False,True,t3_l1p1o9,/r/BPD/comments/l1p1o9/psychedelics/gk0ydlw/,1611335297,1,True,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,0,[],,,,,

Can you journal or express these feelings in a safe way?

In my secret one, there's where I wrote this stuff, no filters so I could just vent and then try and let it go.  You could write on paper and burn it or in a dropbox folder hidden in your computer... whatever helps you get it out.

Not to get over him but to learn what he needs. Identify what kind he is. There are 10 ""labels"" given to narcs depending on what site you are on. Label him. Learn what he needs. Be what he needs.

Mine needs to be preened. Mine is a closeted narc. NO One would believe he is a narc. He fronts anxiety, hermitishness, kind, sweet behavior. He is charming as fuck. He hides his dating app addiction. He plays victim in all his interactions until he feels in control. But he needs continual validation that he is handsome, sexy, desired, and in control. He secures a ""supply"" (woman who will do his bidding, pay for stuff, babysit for free, clean, sex,) and then he has 5 other women that he juggles on the side. Ironically, he treats all the sides as ""main love interests"" and treats the woman doing his daily bidding like a side. He loves making her feel continual twinges of jealousy so she strives for his attention and he uses that to make her feel crazy. It is laughable. But adorable. He is so needy.

Figure out what he needs and be the best damn supply you can. Also remember, anyone not neurotypical is a little smarter than the average bear. So, if he is a narc, he wants all that plus a ""little bonus on the side...mental stimulation"". Be an opponent in his game. Don't win too often. Don't get angry. Don't get jealous.

I am guessing that this isn‚Äôt the first time it‚Äôs come up. Unfortunately, when you make demands of people‚Äôs time and tell them it upsets you if you don‚Äôt get a response right away, you only cause guilt and obligation in the other party. So what happens is they only talk to you because they‚Äôre worried you‚Äôll get upset, not because they are actually interested in talking. So they‚Äôre just fulfilling an obligation and don‚Äôt have much to say, which just triggers you because you can sense their lack of true interest. If you express this upset, you will only annoy the other person because after all, they‚Äôre trying their best to avoid upsetting you and it didn‚Äôt work anyway. What you actually want is impossible to get from a healthy person by asking: genuine interest and connection. Such things happen organically, not through demand. You have to accept that your level of interest in interaction is different from other people‚Äôs and understand that doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt care about you, they just have other things in your life besides you. 

First off, stop the texting. Texting is for sending occasional meme, confirming plans, asking someone to pick something up from the store, shit that doesn‚Äôt require more than 3 back and forth exchanges. 

If you want to actually communicate and talk to someone, pick up the phone and call them. There is a clear start and finish to phone calls. Tone is harder to misunderstand. No one is going to left you on ‚Äúheard.‚Äù If you are not used to phone calls it will be awkward at first but it doesn‚Äôt take many calls to get used to. 

Practice putting your own phone down for several hours at a time and not being glued to it. Take up some kind of hobby or go to the woods once in a while. It‚Äôs harder to get mad at people not answering when you can think ‚ÄúWell sometimes I‚Äôm not by my phone for a few hours either.‚Äù  It‚Äôs good for you to unplug. You also won‚Äôt have anything to obsess over if your phone is literally not on you. 

Sometimes the other person has nothing to say and that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôve been calling my friends once a week since this lockdown bullshit and last week one of my friends straight up said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me next week. I‚Äôm literally doing nothing in quarantine and it‚Äôs stressing me out trying to figure out things to talk to you about.‚Äù And it wasn‚Äôt a big deal! In fact I was happy because I had internalized the most important thing:

Stop reaching out to people only when you need something from them. Whether it be validation, comfort, someone to play therapist and listen to your problems, or to just distract you bc you hate being alone. My phone calls now are only because I am curious about how my friends are doing, or I want to share something that made me think of them. Seeing connection and conversation as a conscious effort needed to build and maintain relationships, instead of something that fulfills a NEED within me, completely changed my expectations with communication. 

Don‚Äôt want to answer the phone? That‚Äôs okay I just wanted to see how you‚Äôre doing. Ball is in your court now, call me if you want to update me about your life and hear about mine

As background, the first time I read a book about BPD was in the 2010s.  One of the things I read in the book was that before the early 2000s BPD was widely regarded as untreatable and patients were sometimes not informed of their diagnosis.  Very likely I received a BPD diagnosis as early as the 1970s because I can now recognize the pattern of mollification over the decades; where doctors would associatively jump on whatever phrase I randomly babbled up and try to mollify me by falsely confirming that that was my health problem.  That's no longer the case because effective treatment for BPD does exist, but fear of legal liability still prevents doctors from providing me with a proper assessment.  The best I was able to do before the pandemic was a 40-minute appointment with a psychiatrist every six weeks.  Since her practice is in a hospital requiring rides in a crowded elevator I've suspended further appointments with her until the risk of Coronavirus infection in hospitals is reduced.

tl;dr I'm happy that younger people don't have to look back on decades of wasted life of being lied to about their health problems because doctors felt there was nothing they could do for us.

That means sth went wrong during our childhood or adolescent age when we needed sth the most. And it all got twisted. Recognizing this fact is very important as well.

Don't see it as either white or black; Those happy friends have their own problems to deal with. Yes yours is possibly much worse. Being stuck in a family that is the result of a loveless marriage. Probably your siblings are going to grow up with some kind of problem as well. You're not alone. 

As for my personal case, my parents slept apart since I can remember. My father was a perfect dictator: Always expecting obedience without having it questioned. I was taught from a very early age to seek parents' validation in anything, but they didn't teach me in what or how. So that still remains to this day.
Anyway, apparantly my father got himself into some affair, my mother couldn't tolerate it, so she spread the word to defame my father et-cetera and last summer, after 3-4 years of pure toxic silence in our house, my father attacked my mother. The eldest son and I intervened but everywhere got bloody already. My father left us after 4 months. It is almost a year since that event happened and yet we're still suing the court cases because we live in a shit hole country. Now we're in a house without him, but now there is this eldest son who is 34 years old and is mentally insane, likely to kill someone if provoked, full of hate. Someone whose characteristics is very similar to mine. Our family broke up. Hard. And none of the relatives on my father's side has called us once after what happened. they all support my father (again, shithole country-shithole town-shitty people). 

Sorry for the long story. I didn't say all that to raise pity, I don't want to give you a moral out of this, and I don't care if you believe it or not. This is my life now. I live it. If it helps, try to imagine yourself in my situation.
If I wanted to give in to all the shit above me and see how sad my life is, I'd be dead now (sometimes I still wish I were). Everybody can get sad in a tough situation, that's just only normal. Your very happy friends would probably get sad (or even sadder) if they were in your shoes. No big deal being sad in a sad life. Can you find it in yourself to keep your head up and smile, knowing that life is hard? Now that's a good challenge, it'd be art and skill to manage that. I'm not a fool, Life probably won't get any better. Accept all that and move on. Bear it voluntarily and smile. That'd make you a better person above those who are happy in a relaxed chill life as if they're doing a good job enjoying.

I woke up one day and ( IT WAS ONE DAY ) I said this to myself, 

‚Äú I cannot take it anymore. I can‚Äôt! I hate me! I hate living! I want to be happy. I want to love me. I want to love my mom and not hate her. I want to hug her again. I want to feel that hug like when I was a little boy. I want to feel excited for her to see me and to miss her like I once did. I don‚Äôt want to hate my step father anymore. I want to live. I want to heal my inner pain.  I want to let go of the anger. I want to stop the triggers. I want to love and to be loved by my girlfriends. I want to be the best I can. I want the depression to stop. I want to wake up and smile. I want to know what it feels like to smile and truly have calm and happiness. I don‚Äôt want to be that man anymore with girlfriends. Insecure.  In fear all the time. Alone. I don‚Äôt want to cry anymore. I want to live!!!!‚Äù

...and with that...

I said, 

‚Äú I do not care how much pain I feel. What inner demons I uncover. I am going to reach down into me so deep and I am going to love and heal and finally listen and honor that little boy who lives inside me and is and was destroyed, abandoned and abused emotionally and mentally and physically by all the adults and parents in my life. I am going to let that little boy heal. ‚Äú

I now share my journey on my YouTube channel and share the deepest thoughts and emotions so that maybe, just maybe, anything I say or do will save another life or help another life to get on the same journey that I am now on without being religious or spiritual.  To offer anything other then the hate and bullshit that plagues our world today.  I am not trying save anybody.  I am just trying to be something different. Something good.  And ...

By just being me and being completely honest and open and sincere. 

I meant no harm. I meant no disrespect.  I promise. I am sorry if I did or upset or offended. Or anything.  

I respect what you said and I hope this text just lets another person know and understand what I was hoping you would share.  And that it will also explain to you what I meant. I wasn‚Äôt clear and that‚Äôs my fault. 

I wanted to hear your answer. I wanted to hear what saved you.

THANK YOU for wording this so eloquently.

OP, while I understand that you feel invalidated and you rightly point this out. BUT I think this discussion goes well beyond BPD stereotypes and I personally believe it's important to think about that.

When males with BPD are described as more aggressive than females, who are more emotional, keep in mind that these are ***very common and general male/female stereotypes, regardless of BPD.***

Today, male stereotypes (rational and agressive) are still valued over female stereotypes (emotional, weak). If a woman, regardless of BPD, gets emotional during a discussion her argument will be invalid because she got emotional. So even though within BPD articles woman may feel validated because being emotional is a symptom, it doesn't mean that being emotional is validated in the real world.

Regardless of gender and regardless of BPD we should want any human being to be able to express their emotions without being invalidated or stereotyped, in other words; without being *shut up.*

Something I try to live by: ***other people struggling aren't your enemy.*** I know you're not blaming females for male stereotypes OP. What I mean with the quote; what matters is that we're both struggling, and  I believe we should emphasize our common objective instead of pointing out our differences.

A life that in the opinion of the individual is simply not worth living. Finding your life worth living means doing what you can to achieve some sense of self, and worth, whatever that means to you.

For some people that means taking your meds as your supposed or finally being able to keep a job. For others it means no longer engaging in self harm. For still others it simply means being able to establish healthy boundaries in dangerous relationships. For some it may be no more violent outbursts. 

We are often and in many ways truly suffering due to whatever symptoms you have. And you will know you have got there when the pain of everyday existence no longer outweighs the joy you get from it. And that as you mention, looks very different for each person.

I think if it were me I‚Äôd just send little messages a couple of times a day saying things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking of you‚Äù and tell her you want to talk and you‚Äôll be there if/when she decides she wants to, that you love her and you miss her. Focus on getting her out of that mindset before talking things through. 

Good luck, and take what I say with a pinch of salt, this is just my opinion from what I have read on your post.

I also have BPD and had a pretty good childhood until a really traumatic event when I was 19 changed everything. 

The thing about trauma is that everyone reacts so differently to it. It doesn‚Äôt have to be anything abusive or extreme to affect you in a deeply personal way. It sounds like the divorce impacted you, and that can absolutely be considered trauma. 

Sometimes BPD can develop from what‚Äôs called a ‚Äòpoor fit‚Äô family, as it did in my case. It‚Äôs when you were born into a family that was either invalidating or completely wrong for your set of emotional needs. BPD can develop from invalidation or disharmony at home.

Did the person say that they were really uncomfortable or that they didn't care for you at all? Sometimes our minds make us think that when really it could be more in between. It could be that the person feels neutral toward us and that's okay because it's a new friendship.

But you can also try to learn from situations and try to do something different next time. If you feel like you've overshared with someone, try slowing it down. But that doesn't mean not sharing anything. Mirror what the other person is sharing, like maybe they share that they don't like a class or their job, etc. Then as the friendship grows they may share more and you may feel comfortable sharing more.

I know that can be easier said than done because sometimes we might feel close to someone like we've known them for a long time, but I try to remind myself that it's still a new friendship even though I feel that way toward them. If they don't share everything at once, it doesn't mean the person doesn't care or that they dislike me, it means that they're still getting to know me.

Reading this made me simultaneously so happy for you, and so sad for me and my former best friend with BPD. We had been friends for over ten years, and I had helped her through some of the hardest times of her life with unconditional love and support. She told me I was the only person in her life that was always on her side, and I even learned more about myself by figuring out how to set my own boundaries between us so she wouldn't call me 30 times at 2 am but still knew that I loved her.

My mom had a heart attack and sustained heavy brain damage about 6 months ago, and it has been extraordinarily stressful for me and my family to deal with the loss and also the stress of being her primary caregivers. I have my own mental health issues, and my former friend knows that I tend to isolate myself when I'm very depressed.

I didn't answer her-- or ANYONE else's-- texts for a long time because I was literally trying not to kill myself any moment I was not around my family. When I eventually started to come out of the deep deep hole, I immediately texted her, took responsibility for how I had undoubtedly hurt her, and asked what we could do together to repair our friendship. She responded coldly and told me eventually that she had no interest in talking to me anymore. After ten years of me responding to every one of her crises, I am so very hurt by this.

But what I will say, BDP doesn't close you off from ever being able to have a relationship or getting close to people. You'll find that while people don't completely get you, some will at least try. But you have to put yourself out there first. Fresh off a diagnosis, this is a good time for you to learn yourself, learn your behaviours and how to cope with them and focus on you.

[],,sadauntrbn,,,[],,,,text,t2_241yha,False,False,[],"I really wish BPD didn't have the terrible negative stigma it does. I really believe that these three letters do far more harm than help. It's the epitome of a label. 

Your post is excellently written and exactly what everyone needs to hear, but I fear that it falls on deaf ears in this sub. Not deaf ears, but reactively defensive downvoting ears. 

I've been lurking for months, as I've studied Attachment Trauma, Personality Disorders, and C-PTSD for many years, and wish to abolish the stigma and help empower BPD sufferers to heal themselves of the trauma that keeps them in this painful cycle.

**BPD is highly treatable,** DBT is a proven and accessible tool. But the sad reality is that most sufferers are stuck in the cycle of self-sabotage, confirmation bias, and perpetual victimization, sadly all symptoms of BPD. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy until you really either A. Get a GOOD therapist who won't enable you, and/or B. have an 'AHA!"" moment like you clearly have, as well as a small number of people here. 

This sub only perpetuates and amplifies the symptoms and cycle. As you'll find, the majority of posts are looking for support for their self-destructive BPD behaviour, not advice or input. The responses are generally validating and commiserating OP's behaviour. I wish people could see how destructive that can be for them.

Sadly, your post will be dismissed by most as 'hating' or 'not understanding', when it's the opposite. Keep sharing your knowledge. The few like you, who have spent time alone to self-reflect and learn that there is a way out, they will find your post and have their own Aha! moment when they're ready. 

Look into Peter Walker ([web](http://pete-walker.com/fourFs_TraumaTypologyComplexPTSD.htm)). He is an expert on CPTSD and Trauma, and believes that BPD is highly misdiagnosed. He believes very much as you explained, that BPD is a construct of attachment trauma, and sufferers are stuck in the 4 Rs - Fight, Flight, Freeze, Fawn. It's eye-opening. 

Also, head over to [r/CTPSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/) sub, there are great resources and support. 

For a ton of free DBT resources, there's an amazing megapost on [r/DBTSelfHelp](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbtselfhelp/comments/6ujifl/self_help_workbooks_megapost/)

Have a think about your other coworkers too. Managers learn to get stern because if they're a pushover they'll end up with people who repeatedly do things they dont want. Once isn't a big deal - they'll forget about it in a week. 

Plus, think about their experience on their end - maybe you woke them up, thats a mild inconvenience but youre clearly trying to give enough notice. They blearily text the department manager and fall back asleep and forget about it. Next time you see them, you apologise and say ""sorry, I was migraine addled and stressed about work so I texted - I won't text at that kind of time again.""

I was in a relationship that meant EVERYTHING to me, yes unhealthy I know, but I became fixated on making it work more than anything. My whole entire purpose became that relationship, even though I was being gaslit, manipulated, and treated like trash, I didn't know at the time and believed I was causing all this horrible treatment because I was just such a horrible mess of a person, and he was frustrated putting up with me. I blamed it on the fact that I wasn't connecting properly because of the antidepressant I was on and that is why he was wanting to spend time with other females etc...and then throw it in my face. I had this idealized version of him on my head and because he treated everyone else with respect I believed it was because I didn't deserve respect because I was worse than everyone else. He told me the reason he criticized me all the time was to make me better and because he cared. I had such a poor self image and self esteem that I didn't even realize it wasn't my fault. I truly felt like I deserved to be treated like trash, because of all my problems. I stayed away from others thinking if only they knew me they would be critical as well. 

Like you I found (a counsellor )someone who told me that this was not my fault and I deserved better. A part of me wanted to believe it but I kept thinking "" if only she knew how problamatic I really am, she would sympathize with him"" I really looked down on myself so much, and couldnt see how anyone would like me and even felt lucky I had this abusive person putting up with me and all my baggage. It ended up he decided to leave the country to pursue what he wanted, found out he had being cheating on me for months and the next few years of my life went spinning into a nightmare, I reached out sometimes in a desperate, miserable state only to be told ' get lost you mean nothing, you are nobody' or ignored, it was devastating.  I blamed myself and felt completely lost without him, it's called a 'trauma bond', and I suggest you look into it, it helps to get an idea of what is causing it. 

Anyway here I am with no friends, and having to rebuild my life from scratch, I am not sure what direction to take and it's all a bit scary, I have anxiety because I dont have much life experience outside of this, and I am not sure how to build a relationship with someone even a friendship, because I dont have the general things of working or college for years because of all the problems, and the last thing I want to tell people is the hell I've been through, because it's so personal, but at the same time I am proud of getting through such a dark period, and you will too.

[],,kittykatbox,,,[],,,,text,t2_mokob,False,False,[],"I got my degree in philosophy. My favorite philosophers are Kierkegaard and Camus. I highly recommend doing philosophy courses (whether that's through college or some sort of online class website) because watching videos is not quite the same as scouring primary source texts and grasping the meaning of the text yourself. It's very rewarding and enriching!! 

I kind of went on a ramble here so feel free to skip it--

The core tenets of existentialism are that life is inherently meaningless *but* that *you* yourself can create and give meaning to life. Existentialism isn't about declaring that ""nothing in life matters"", it's that there is no *inherent* meaning to anything, and that the meaning of life comes from yourself, or that you can find meaning in the things you do, places you see, the people you surround yourself with. 

Camus' version of existentialism is called absurdism, and he said that there is this constant struggle for us to find meaning in life, and yet we never find it nor create it because there is none, thus making the search for meaning absurd, and the search for it *itself* meaningless. It can be easy to take this philosophy and twist it in a dark sense, but it does a disservice to the work that Beauvoir, Camus, and Sartre did to solidify existentialism as a core branch of philosophy. 

If you're interested in learning more about existentialism, an easy book to start with is *the Stranger* by Albert Camus (it's pretty short, and it's a novel). You could also read his essay *Myth of Sisyphus*, but that one's a bit tougher, and *the Stranger* helps lay the groundwork for understanding Camus' essay on the myth of Sisyphus (it's a Greek myth, check it out).",,1595026102,{},fyeqdm5,False,t3_hszffn,False,True,t3_hszffn,/r/BPD/comments/hszffn/are_any_of_you_guys_interested_in_philosophy/fyeqdm5/,1595029679,1,True,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,0,[],,,,,

No no!
Having BPD isn't your fault, and *feeling what you feel is not your fault*

If we could *decide* what we feel - if we had any power over which emotions occur in us - nobody would have a mental illness amiright??

The *only* thing here that you get to choose is your response to your emotions. That's your responsibility.
And even then, you can't choose your behaviours around an emotional response *until you've developed the skills to do so*.

It's not a child's fault if they haven't yet learned the skill of tying shoelaces. We don't fault them; we teach them.
It's not a new driver's fault if they haven't yet learned the skill of changing gears. We don't fault them; we teach them.

It's not your fault if you don't yet have the skills to manage your behavioural responses to your emotions. You simply don't yet have those skills.
It's your responsibility to *obtain* those skills though.
Once you know how to delay your responses, self-soothe, consider whether your interpretation if the situation is accurate or in doubt, and *then* respond from a place of calm and clarity, and you've mastered these skills so you can use them in highly volatile periods, *then* your responses can be your fault.

I know it's just words, but I really feel that you'd do well to reframe the way you think about yourself.
'Fault' is a blaming word.
It's not a word we should use when we simply don't yet have the required skills for a task.
Unless we're *aware that we lack those skills*, and we're *choosing not to attempt to obtain those skills*, we aren't at fault for doing only what we know how to do.

How we think about ourselves, and which words we use to do so, is *so* important to our sense of self.",,1596496651,{},g09pe0s,False,t3_i2n5tn,False,True,t1_g06e2m2,/r/BPD/comments/i2n5tn/i_know_this_is_irrational_but/g09pe0s/,1596506215,1,True,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,0,[],,,,,

Sadly relatable.

Unfortunately the answer for my sitch, might not ring true for you.

Offering my advice (mostly because I'm not using it) free of charge &amp; because in reading your post);

1. Keep it simple &amp; vague. 
2. From how I interpreted the post, you would like to be able to make meaningful relationships.
3. Small steps (lots of them), that enable an increased emotional skill sets (the emotional development that didn't happen or was damaged) 
4. Plan on stumbling (fall down 7 times, get up 8).
5. Yeah, uh, okay, nows where you're catching up to me, so, the reality is all of my ""efforts"" are employed daily as if I were starting fresh, everyday (&amp; it sounds like bs. It's working for me because I don't know what I want. I know I don't want to live in sorrow &amp; thats what I use for motivation or fuel for my efforts, I'm burning the sorrow out of my life, slowly,  like tattooing my entire body, by hand, with a single needle).

It sounds like you haven't gone through the last stage: Acceptance.

My 2c as a random observer is that your husband is being cruel, making you stew in agonizing guilt indefinitely until he finally decides to issue his self-righteous decree on the matter of your marriage.

He knows that you suffer with mental illness and he knows the pain the seperation is causing you. It sounds to me like he's having the ego trip of his life while feeding on your strength and spirit.

People make mistakes, especially when our brains don't work in a healthy way. If he won't forgive you, forgive yourself and put your mistake in the past where it belongs.

My greatuncle was a police officer and had two children a little bit older than me, like 7 (boy) and 5 (girl). I remember there was a party all the time and they had the habit of gambling/cart's games, there was alcohol all the time and no sober adult. One day during one of those parties a teenager cousin (a bit newer than my mon, I think he was 16 and mom was 19) gave me a cup of wine and I went drunk, but I felt sick and mom didn't talk to me, she didn't do anything rather than mock me and laugh at me and suddenly everybody was teasing a 3 years old boy for being drunk.

Look, it happened 30 years ago, but sometimes I dream of it. Last time I vent to my mother about that situation, how I felt shame, fear, and confusion and she laughed at me again. She said: What was I supposed to do? You were already drunk, like, the only thing we could have made out of that situation was make fun of you... Yup.

Another event that took place when I lived there was my little cousin accidentally shooting my greatuncle's gun, but thank God nobody gets hurt.

They both hit me hard, I hadn't really felt anything that strongly in weeks I was so numb but I felt them and it was like I was healed just like that. Then I decided to listen to Safe and Sound every night before I went to sleep, but after a week my emotions were ""going away"" again and the song didn't make a difference anymore. I managed to keep the ""break"" going for a little while but since then, I have been terrified of doing anything I love because I don't want to grow numb to them. I don't want to let the impact something can have on me to go away just because it's become repetitive.

Then, I spent a miserable year in a university far away from home where I was bullied and invalidated on a daily basis and sexually assaulted occasionally so I pretty much split on my time in that damned city. It was like every time I made my way back home, I could be clean, I could be free to enjoy myself but I barely ever had a whole weekend to work with there, and remembering college hurt. What I hated most was that my brain was starting to forge associations between my time there and any thing that happened there that I could enjoy, the few good memories I had haunted me.

I've gotten over those things a little bit, there's a lot of things I avoided for a long time because I was worried I would grow indifferent to them or get flashbacks to an awful time because of them that I avoid a lot less now and the only advice I could give you is to just try to ignore your misery and just try things. Even if you don't enjoy it at the moment, even if you stop enjoying it after a while, someday the same thing could have a nostalgic meaning to you and that can serve as some sort of foundation you can build some joy on.

The way i put myself in a mindset where i think rationally and healthily and not get intense is to breath in for five seconds,hold for 7, then out for four again. I do it three times, relax and honestly ask myself how i truly feel in the moment. The answer that comes immediately is usually what i knew deep down to be right, but it was clouded by cognitive distortions and poor judgement. If you have ever noticed that sometimes you started having a  good day bc you weren't overthinking, like you were on autopilot (but the pleasant easy going kind, not the destructive kind peeps with bpd talk about), it was because you were thinking in the moment, and not letting all the sadness and depression and loneliness project onto your decisions.

And also find it non-threatening as what you talk about in there won't have social repercussions in your normal life unlike when you struggle with BPD in any other social context.

And this is your first session, but overall for you future, I've found it helpful to try and form a friendly bond with my therapist. They have rules medically that they're supposed to kind of keep a certain level of professional separation from there patients. (While still being kind, friendly, helpful, and compassionate). But I would offer you the lived experience advice that when you can have a therapist who really also cares about you on a personal level in addition to a professional level, it can be important, because the therapists that generally care are the ones who will go to bat for you in those reoccurring times of need.

The other thing I would add from lived experience is part of their job is to push you to help you push yourself to do the work of self discovery and making the improvements in your life you want and need but you can only do yourself. They're never there to be antagonistic or confrontational, they're there to first listen, respect what you have to say, and think upon what you have to say and how you feel, but later on also after getting to know you for who you are, to challenge you to do what you actually want to do for yourself, but may not yet know you need to do for yourself. So therapy can offer the first common function of being listened to, being heard, and being a place for you to vent. That is one basic aspect of most therapy, but later on it becomes more about them figuring out ways to help you to push to make the changes that will help you lead a happy, safe, functional life.

They love bomb and appeal to our idealizing behaviour, and when we‚Äôve latched ourselves onto them, they see our fear of abandonment and use that to manipulate us.

I still have all of the emotional symptoms, but I've got the physical under control and have stopped self harming (the urge is there, but not acted upon for years now) and to anyone that didn't know me, they would think I was just a normal person with a tiny bit of a shopping problem that's not even enough to cause any financial distress. And that, whenever I wasn't in a relationship, I was a bit promiscuous. (I've never cheated on anyone, because betraying them like that would cause them to leave and, like most of us, fear of abandonment is my main driving force.)

When I was younger, I didn't know what was going on, and I didn't have enough self control to stop from acting on my impulses. I often went into typical BPD rages, would self mutilate, steal, lie, try to fight people a lot, etc. After a suicide attempt landed me in the hospital, combined with discovering I was self harming, my dad put me into therapy, which is where I was diagnosed with BPD. 

I've tried opening up to various people about it over the years. My family tends to be very appearance orientated, and while they believe in mental health awareness, they also couldn't accept that someone in their own family has a mental health disorder (except for my dad, of course). Others (like my mom, who did not have physical custody of me after the age of 6 months) weren't even aware of the diagnosis until I had learned to hide my behaviors (prior to actually controlling them), and since she wasn't aware of any related behaviors, declared that I did not have the order and was just ""a drama queen"".  I just haven't brought it up to any of them since. I've also shared the diagnosis with most of my romantic partners throughout my life (at least ones in which I was trying to build an actual relationship with). Some just kind of shrugged it off. The worst of the worst (abusive ex) used it to try and gaslight me, and when I ended things, used it as a way to lie about my behaviors. He would even go so far as to message new partners (YEARS after I had ended all of my contact with him) to tell them things like that I've slept with 90 people (I haven't, my real number is less than 20, which is average for my age and the area I live in) to try and end my relationships. Of course, HIS ""crazy"" (a potent combination of autism, explosive intermittent rage disorder, an IQ of like 70, and an addiction to crack) is always apparent to the average person within the first couple of sentences he utters, so none of them took him seriously. But, it still hurt to work so hard on myself and to have someone try to use it against me anyway. 

The stigma is real. And, for people who have a hard time trusting anyway, it's devastating when you open up to someone and they either shut you down (which makes you feel invalidated) or gaslight you (which makes you feel even worse). But, if you want to have a successful relationship with someone, you have to be able to be truthful with them. My husband (29m) has dealt with his own mental health issues since he was a teenager, also doing an upstanding job of controlling his symptoms (I think his official diagnosis was ADHD and explosive intermittent rage, and just so you know, he's never blown up on me or our son). Because he has had experience with mental health, the stigmas around disorders, and the process of learning how to cope and behave in appropriate and healthier ways, hes always been very understanding of what's going on in my head, why it's going on, whether it's something I need to deal with or need his help with, etc. He's also been very supportive. And on his end, the anger issues run in his family, and his younger brother (with similar issues) still can't believe that he's able to just sit down and talk to his wife about what's going on in his own head. 

TL/DR: Its both possible and (I believe) necessary to share your diagnosis with a potential long-term partner. A lot of people might not understand, or might even use it against you, but the right person will and will support you on your mental health journey.",,1596488472,{},g098wxx,False,t3_i32wem,False,True,t3_i32wem,/r/BPD/comments/i32wem/coming_out_ruined_my_relationship_with_my_fp/g098wxx/,1596497360,1,True,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,0,[],,,,,

What helps me feel somewhat okay with it is if you go back 100 years, just 100 dam years, there weren't 'careers' like there are today. You'd be a tradesman or a factory worker or a butcher and no one would judge you and there was no ""ladder"" to keep climbing and browning your nose to get up. Idk, I'm probably only half right there but that thought helps me. Also right now in the US, how can you even attempt to start a career with what's happening to the economy?

[],,i-stan-myself,,,[],,,,text,t2_42jubt3g,False,False,[],"Hey I don‚Äôt 100% relate, but I‚Äôve struggled on and off with an eating disorder for about six years, for a long time I was starving myself without the drive to lose weight, my therapist described it as an act of self harm, that depriving my body stemmed from a feeling I didn‚Äôt deserve food. Something that has massively helped me is meal planning, and I don‚Äôt mean like those annoying self help people making dry chicken in boxes for the week. But creating a meal plan, breakfast, lunch and dinner. I know you said you don‚Äôt have the money for a nutritionist which is pretty crappy but try and find a time you have the motivation and sit down and think about what you can manage. If you‚Äôre eating very little at the moment think about foods that are safe and easy I.e granola bar and banana for breakfast, ham sandwich and bag of crisp for lunch, noodles for dinner. 

Once you‚Äôre comfortable start to incorporate more balanced meals, and more snacks and things you know you enjoy. But the first step is getting into that routine of having regular meals. Make a ‚Äúmeal plan‚Äù for every day of the week, try and mix it up a bit, and shop based on that meal plan. Then treat the meal plan as your medication. Food is keeping you alive, you need it as much as any medication you may/ may not take. Keep it somewhere you can see it every day, and try your best to stick to it.

It does sound like a lot of effort but to move forward in recovery sometimes you have to take that first step. If you‚Äôre genuinely concerned about your safety ring a crisis line, or search up some ED support lines in your area. 

It‚Äôs gonna be hard and sometimes you will still not find that energy to eat, but hopefully looking at that meal plan and treating food as a fuel will help you get back on track!!

I was diagnosed with BPD after starting drinking cough syrup at 12, smoking at 13, pills, coke, fentanyl and too many others to remember besides meth. I was prescribed Xanax at 15 for panic attacks so bad I‚Äôd vomit every time I had one. I used to abuse them but managed to actually use the responsibility again. I‚Äôm beyond proud of myself for that.
I‚Äôm still prescribed them, and they actually help. Luckily, I‚Äôm clean now - kratom has saved my life in terms of anxiety, severe depression and addiction. If you want to know more, check out r/kratom. It may not be for everyone though; this is my own experience. 
Also, my parents were emotionally abused by their parents and sadly passed on their behaviours through generations. Although I know it‚Äôs not intentional, their emotionally abusive patterns still have an impact to this day. I hate talking to them about anything because they start yelling at me the second I start crying. I feel like the only person I can talk to is my brother; I keep skipping therapy appointments from anxiety and lack of motivation. 
Finally, I also suffer from sleep disturbances. Severely vivid and violent nightmares, to be exact. They‚Äôve gotten to the point where I hate sleeping but I hate being awake because I‚Äôm so irritable and tired... but I also don‚Äôt want to sleep because the nightmares are so bad. Oftentimes, without the use of kratom, I don‚Äôt want to do anything with my life either. And kratom isn‚Äôt a strong substance at all so it isn‚Äôt that that‚Äôs causing the lack of motivation to live.
Anyway, I just wanted to say that you‚Äôre not alone in what you‚Äôre going through, as cliche as it may sound. I feel you in many areas. I don‚Äôt have much advice to give besides advising to reconsider taking antidepressants. My parents didn‚Äôt want me on antidepressants for years but when I finally started taking them behind their backs, and found one that worked, it‚Äôs made my life so much better. I went through 5 scripts before finding Effexor that works for me, but honestly, it was worth it. Effexor and kratom are the only reasons I‚Äôm able to get out of bed and keep my job. I‚Äôm lucky to have an employer that‚Äôs very empathetic with mental illness. 

Best of luck and stay strong! Lots of love. You‚Äôve got this, even though it may feel like you don‚Äôt. Try to keep your thoughts positive.

We met as a one-night-stand, but it was the honesty on both parties that helped us connect and fall in love. I don't think flirting with women you see out in the bar just because your friends say so is the way to go. 

If you have no female connections in your life already - friends, classmates, coworkers, etc. - then talking to random women is probably your only choice. But maybe you can try to notice something about them first. Not just a physical quality, but something they do, something they say, something about their mannerisms. Then start a conversation with that, and just keep being honest. Disclose what you feel and think, and don't try to sweet-talk the woman. Find something to bond over. Also, ask a lot of questions. The more they disclose about their lives, the more they trust you, and the more you understand them.

That way, rejection isn't exactly all that bad. They're not interested in strictly how good-looking you are, because you're not strictly trying to ""date"" or sleep with the woman; you're putting yourself out there just as a person who wants to connect.

That could help with the whole ""ending"" it problem, too. If you keep it casual but honest, you don't have to feel obliged to end something, because it hasn't yet been established as ""something"".

I‚Äôm currently studying for the MCAT &amp; this is really empowering to read.

I find it most helpful when physicians try their best to listen, validate, meet me where I‚Äôm at, &amp; include me as an equal partner in decision-making. I‚Äôve spent nearly a decade being passed around in mental healthcare industry &amp; have met far too many providers who think they know me better than I know myself. 

Please do your best to refrain from making snap judgements about patients. Also, validation is about emotions. Feelings are necessarily valid. Actions are not. When you say ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt always let you have your way‚Äù, consider, *does my medical training account for the experiences this patient has been through? What part of the picture might I be missing here?*

For instance, if I say psych meds haven‚Äôt worked for me, maybe ask me to elaborate before assuming I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm taking about.

Lastly, yes, we should take responsibility for when we hurt others. That said, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that you‚Äôre only seeing the patient, and not their family/friends. There‚Äôs a good chance the borderline patient isn‚Äôt the by only one who can become dysregulated or be hurtful. It‚Äôs funny, I‚Äôm actually the most skillful person in my family, despite being the only one diagnosed. That said, I‚Äôve done DBT &amp; have an amazing therapist who I‚Äôve seen weekly for about 2 years, but whenever I go to the hospital or a new doctor it feels like they just assume I‚Äôm the problem in all of my relationships.

Don‚Äôt get caught up in reading posts that discriminate against or degrade people with BPD. The people behind those posts have no fucking clue what they‚Äôre talking about, they‚Äôve likely never met someone with BPD; they have usually consulted Dr. Google and slapped a label on the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù in their story that they do not understand. BPD is an easy target for this, because it‚Äôs misunderstood and the false stereotypes run rampant.

Using someone‚Äôs mental illness to insult them is revolting. Calling someone a ‚ÄúBPD hoe‚Äù makes that guy a fucking tool. You‚Äôre better off without lowlifes like that, OP, but I‚Äôm still sorry you experienced that.

I‚Äôm yet to have someone use my BPD as a way to insult me in real life, but unfortunately I know that day will eventually come. I‚Äôm private about my diagnosis in real life; I‚Äôve only told my best friend and parents, but my parents would‚Äôve told my (estranged) sister, who is an absolute bitch. She once used the fact that I‚Äôm on antidepressants to insult me, something I specifically told my parents not to let her know about, she found out by accident when my mum left the box in the kitchen and she saw it. 

Even though I have absolutely nothing to do with her and live in a different state, sometimes my parents will bring her here when they visit me, and I unfortunately have to see her at my parents‚Äô house when I go home. I‚Äôm expecting the insult to come from her, and since I already despise her, I‚Äôm exactly not sure how that‚Äôll go down, but I can imagine retaliating or snapping and even getting physical (there‚Äôs a long history, I have an extremely short fuse when it comes to her, she‚Äôs a bitch to everyone, even my parents, which makes me absolutely enraged).

[],,sophiebeanzee,,,[],,,,text,t2_5rbq2sgq,False,False,[],"I think first of all, psychiatrist &amp; therapist that know well, have lots of knowledge, and experience w BPD are the best ones to go to, the therapist I had, had BPD herself and she still has it. So she knows everything I've been through. Ofc she was still going  to be calm, and understanding but w me it feels she's calm and understanding than most therapists I've had in the past which is just amazing how much when a person esp someone in a psychiatry unit is calm and understanding just how much help is given and received. (my bad had to say my two-bits on therapy stuff, been there done that, and still currently in w my psychiatrist just recently dropped out of therapy but it's going to be temporarily! So I completely understood when you said you had felt better after talking to them!) 

\&gt;&gt;&gt; anyways, I was going to say I actually turned down several applications (not even getting to the interview,) for jobs that had anything to do w customer service because I knew I would be talking on the phone. Even receptionist jobs I turned down, and any front desk job where I would be interacting w others. It's odd because if I start talking initially, ofc I'm going to be nervous, and it takes a while too like I would say anywhere around 15-30mins, sometimes even a hr to get comfortable enough to actually start saying what you want to say when your talking/thinking about in your head. This also happens even on phone calls to those who I'm close too, and I'm 19, so you would think I would like phone calls, ik most people my age gen like to call someone, esp if it's someone you care about, or if that person says it's easier for them to talk on the phone and I always feel slightly bad about when my bf wants to call because he knows I'm upset about something, or anxious or whatever it may be at the time, because I know he wants to help and when I'm not w him he feels better explaining about how he might be able to help me through the phone, and my therapist actually was the same way but she was very understanding in that I had a issue w the phone so I would give her an overview of the situation and depending on how in depth it was we would find a way to deal w it in the moment, or if it was too in depth then she would say we could talk more about it on the day of my appt which would be every friday. Anyways, I usually try to give exs of how I relate to whatever the post is, or whatever someone is having an issue w because ik for me relating to someone else is most important to me rather than trying to solve their problem, I don't think it's much of a feeling alone type of issue, I think it's more like the feeling of wanting to be heard, and to have someone at least even if they can't help but to listen to me and that I know I have someone I can at least go to that I can talk to.

I skipped school and work because I was having suicidal behavior. I was already diagnosed with BPD and knew my episodes stopped me from completing homework and showing up to work on time. I went to an urgent care and I was so emotionally on edge that I had to write my feelings on a piece of paper because I didn‚Äôt have the power or courage to say it out loud, much less have a mental breakdown. After being so reassuring, he calmly asked me, ‚ÄúHow long do you need off?‚Äù I thought two or three days was reasonable to ask from a doctor. He said, ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù I looked at him confused. He then told me his life story, and how a leg injury reduced his athletic dreams to nothing. He had a doctor in his life that showed him unconditional love as a mentor, and that he granted him the medical clearance in his life to skip school and work to get his mental and emotional state back together‚Äîeven after physical therapy. He was so inspired by his kindness and patience, that he decided to become a doctor himself. He kept addressing the fact that he had been in my shoes, and that asking for one week, one month, or one semester off is something he‚Äôll gladly write off for me. I asked ugly-crying and everything, ‚ÄúWhat about money? If I focus on my mental health, I‚Äôll skip work, and I won‚Äôt have any money.‚Äù And he told me not to worry. ‚ÄúRight now, you have to honor your time to struggle, and that‚Äôs OK.

[],,togenkyos,,,[],,,,text,t2_4sjd5f39,False,False,[],"Hi. I really empathize with your post. I've found myself in a very similar situation. So I'd like to try to address a couple of things. 

First off, sometimes letting your guard down can, understandably, feel incredibly scary, even terrifying. It's possible that the actual act of letting your guard down, so to speak, would not be as scary under the right circumstances. You have expressed discontent with your current state and that you would like to change. It sounds like you've gone through a shit ton of trauma and pain, and it's entirely understandable that you wouldn't want to be vulnerable to others. Rather than starting by letting your guard down entirely, you could perhaps try to simply start by being nicer to others. I know it sounds cheesy, but something I've found is that  ever since I've started being nicer to others in the smallest of ways- just in demeanor, not by necessarily getting too attached to them so I can still avoid vulnerability- I've felt... less angry? I suppose it depends on where your anger stems from, so you can take that with a grain of salt if you'd like. 

I think it's important to note, too, that it's completely natural to feel a desire to get revenge when someone has wronged us. However, what I've found is that it truly has made me feel more miserable in the long run. You could argue that it contributes negativity in the world, whereas it sounds like you are a person who would like to contribute positivity, and to be positive, but simply don't know how. I've been there. 

Frankly speaking, I'd like to address where you mentioned that people will judge you. To be honest, it doesn't matter that people will judge you. The only thing that matters is how you see yourself. If you are striving every day to be a good person, then their judgements don't matter anyway. It's just their opinion of you; it says nothing about who you are as a person. Your actions say that. And while understandable that you'd have so much anger, it's never too late to change your actions. It's never too late to make a different choice; just because you have been making these choices does not mean that you have to keep doing them or that you are defined by them. You can choose differently. Perhaps that means sitting with your anger. Just sit with it and let yourself feel your anger, without acting on it. Remind yourself that your feelings do not necessarily HAVE to be acted on and that you are a person who is separate from your emotions. Your emotions do not define who you are. 

If you feel it is needed, perhaps seeking a therapist who specializes in trauma and anger management will help. I understand how being a survivor of trauma impacts and causes anger and even rage/lashing out at others, yet it is not talked about often. You are a person deserving of love as much as anyone else and you CAN change if you so desire. Don't let anyone hold the opinion of your past over your head. It's your life.

Go to a full blown PhD Psychologist. 

Have psych do full clinical review (interview) with you. They‚Äôll go all the way back through much of your childhood. How you did in school. Friends. Girl/boyfriends. Relationships with parents. Any abuses you may have suffered. Drinking and Drugs. Medical history (particularly psych-related) of your parents and others close to you. Suicide attempts or ideology. What you think of your childhood... 

Then your adult life (presuming you are...). Job history. Relationships. Finances. Criminal history. Previous mental illness treatment or medications. Things going on ‚Äúpresently‚Äù in your life. Etc. etc. etc. 

It‚Äôll be a deep dive in all of ‚Äúyou‚Äù if the psych is worth his/her salt. Expect full clinical review to take in upwards of 2-3 hours over several sessions. 

Be completely honest during the interview. Don‚Äôt inflate or deflate your answers. Don‚Äôt conveniently leave out certain details to paint a particular narrative. Don‚Äôt tell little white lies. 

Depending on the presentation of certain disorders, the psych may then have you perform a series of computer-based, hand-written, and/or verbal tests. Then the big one ‚Äî MMPI-2 test. Around 550 questions. Fortunately it‚Äôs just True / False rather than scales from 1-3 or 1-5. The full battery of tests may take you another 2-3 hours over several sessions. 

Again, be completely 100% honest in your answers to the test questions ‚Äî particularly the MMPI-2. If you lie on the MMPI-2, you‚Äôre just wasting  everyone‚Äôs time. 

The psych will then interpret results of all tests and in conjunction with your clinical review, will determine the diagnosis(es) and recommended next steps in treatment. 

This is the course I would take if I really wanted to know/understand what was going on with me. Acceptance of the outcomes is another story, and only you can determine if you are ready for that...

For example (it's kinda a bad one but the first one I came up with), I'm a guy with BPD and often tend to get overly attached in relationships and such like you see in posts here.  However, unlike the women, it causes me to have way *less* sex, because women I talk to see I'm a little clingy, and understandably step back.  Meanwhile women with BPD will impulsively use sex as a way of getting attention (not maliciously obviously), which leads to some posts we see here.  

I also think that because there's a lot of stigma behind men discussing mental health (though society is certainly leagues ahead of where it was a few years ago on this), there's a larger saturation of women who get BPD diagnoses and thus a larger saturation of women in spaces such as this subreddit, who actually realize there's a classification for their issues (I was only recently diagnosed, and browsing places like this subreddit made me feel understood like nothing before)",,1602378720,{},g8end4h,False,t3_j8oxbt,False,True,t1_g8dsyhe,/r/BPD/comments/j8oxbt/is_there_a_place_for_guys_with_bpd/g8end4h/,1602385278,1,True,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,0,[],,,,,

When my abandonment trigger starts, I go into a meltdown and become unreasonable and overly forceful in my communication. I feel like I go into a tunnel where all of my emotions become very intense and every little word and action of my partner is misinterpreted as further abandonment. I will hear conversations incorrectly and interpret meaning incorrectly because I am triggered. I will paint my partner into a true villain who has the worst intentions for me... Even though this rarely matches reality.

He lied and that was VERY wrong for him to do. But he said a key phrase that we need to listen to - He didn't want to make you more upset. I don't think he has bad intentions towards you, and I don't think he wants to hurt you on purpose. I know you love him and you're looking for solutions to the situation that won't lead to breaking up, so I'm trying to offer a potential solution.... It sounds like the trust needs to be repaired. He needs to feel safe to express to you his need to go to a party and be with his friends and blow off steam. You need to feel safe that you can trust him to go to a party and not cheat on you. This trust needs to be built on both sides. It might not have ever been there since the beginning.

In a healthy relationship, both partners need to feel safe to be themselves. It's difficult for us to promote safety in a relationship if we are always reacting emotionally to our partners and assuming bad intentions from them. It makes them feel unsafe to be themselves and do what they want to do because they fear our reactions. 

A great place to start is researching ""how to be vulnerable in relationships"" and  ""non-combative communication styles."" 

Part of BPD is that we are afraid to be truly vulnerable with our partners, because we are afraid of being hurt and abandoned. The funny thing about true vulnerability is that it draws people closer to us and increases intimacy if we can practice it in a relationship. Definitely worth Googling.

""Non-combative communication"" is a way of speaking in relationships that avoids shaming or blaming our partner for their behavior, which allows us to increase vulnerability, trust and intimacy.

If you want to try to work this out with him, try looking those things up and sharing it with him, and working on it as a team. I believe in you guys!

I've 40 next year, my wife is 3 months older than me and we've been together since March 1997, just before she turned 16. 

It's ok to like other people's photos. It's ok to think other people are attractive.  There are people who my wife knows I think are attractive, Kate Beckinsale being number 1 on my hot lost. I know she fancies Thor.  I look nothing like Thor until the last Avengers film with his dad bod. My wife finds people she knows in real life attractive, and she knows I do. 

It doesn't mean anything though other than we're not blind.  Just because she finds someone hot doesn't mean she'll run off with them, and the same here. 

If you can learn to be honest with people you're in a relationship with about that kind of thing it can actually help build the bond, but just liking someone's photo doesn't mean you fancy them anyway. It's just an acknowledgement that you've seen it. 

He shouldn't have lied about going out that's for sure, but sometimes people just have enough of people and need a break.  I know I used to be able to really annoy my wife and looking back on the last 20+ years I have no idea why she's even with me. I've been a royal dick at times. 

We can't control people, we can demand that people are faithful and honest with us, but we can't demand things like ""don't like anything other girls post!"" because it's one step away from telling someone what they can and can't say, what they can spend money on etc. 

What you need to do is set some proper ground rules, but you can't base them around your BPD and the insecurities it gives us.  It's simple things like no lying no matter what, I'd rather be hurt and mad than lied too.  Let's always discuss things without getting emotional.  If my BPD flairs up, give me space to resolve it and we'll continue. 

You also need to be able to have these difficult conversations without escalating the situation. with your BPD. For me, if something is said that triggers me, I walk away, I sit by myself, I think it through, I let my logic win over my feelings and then go back to the conversation.  

remember, you're 2 individuals working together to make a team. It's about respect. trust, understanding and communication. not about control.

Maybe some space apart would give you both time to reflect on what you both want. It's difficult because when feelings and emotions are involved your judgement is sometimes not what it should be. Seems like you need to ask yourself is this what you want from a relationship. Is it ultimately going to make you more unhappy if you carry it on. Will you be able to forget what's happened and be able to move on. Only you can decide what you want to do. But from what you've said on your post it sounds quite a toxic relationship.

My suggestion would be to take some time out and have a proper think about things. It's difficult for people to comment because there's always two sides to every story.

For instance, women driving aggressively and being abusive, angry are generally seen as more normal male-related behaviours, while men don't have emotions, hence the ""man up"" when people are upset so when we do, it's ridiculed.

Landed me in jail on a felony weapons charge, landed me in a ""voluntary"" 2 month psych hospital stay where i has to line up to take my pills in the morning and open my mouth to show them I swallowed them.  I had a very late diagnosis, and was impressed when the neuropsychiatrist told me I was the most severe case he'd ever worked with doing really well in all 9 of the DSM indicators.    

I do think BPD is unique for men, to have such emotional depth, to be able to be intensely empathetic.  In relationships it's almost a reversed role, but based on the inaccurate stigma of the woman being the emotional crazy one.    
Sometimes I do feel self conscience about it, prior I was stoic, in control type A.  I still have that personality in me but it's softer unless it needs to be harder.    
I try to be honest and open with men or woman, practicing acceptance for who I am, what I deal with and being  unapologetically myself.    
It also may be my age, but before this I never gave a damn what anyone thought of me.  When I broke it changed that. But I'm back to being with myself and not worrying what anyone else has to say or think about it.    
All of that being said a place for males with BPD, would probably be a helpful resource for a lot of people.    

I've also learned that with the pain comes elated joy too.  My ex was making fun of me because I was tearing up when my daughter opened a gift and was overcome with joy, I'd rather feel those feelings with fierce intensity good or bad and not be ashamed of it.

The mod team pretty much as a whole prefers the sort of content that you describe as ""more serious"" or mature. 

It would be a lot nicer to have that sort of content on this sub, but unfortunately people don't create it. How else can we have an environment where that sort of content is created and thrives if nobody starts the conversation? I highly encourage and recommend the ""more mature"" crowd to start these discussions here on r/BPD. Not because I don't want you guys to have your own sub, but because this is the sort of thing we want for the sub. 

And along with that, I find it imperative to adapt the subreddit to what you all ask for. If we have a group of people who are wanting to create a new sub curated to certain content, it means there's an issue of inclusion and lack of engaging content for certain groups here on r/BPD. I personally do not want that to happen. I want the people who want to create a new sub to... stay here, feel welcome here, want to engage in these sorts of discussions, and not feel alienated. To take that elsewhere means that we will have even *less* of that content here. 

So that's why I ask of you all: what can we as the mod team do to make this happen? Because trust me, the majority of the mod team (if not all of us) feel pretty much the same way about the content. We want better, more fulfilling discussion to happen, less validation of bad behaviors, more honest, good advice, etc. Why don't we all work together to make this subreddit a better place? Of course, I cannot make you all stay, and you're free to create your own communities. I can only hope you all will help us improve the sub. Since I became a mod last year in January, we've grown by 72k subscribers. We've had trouble adapting to that, and it's going to get bigger.

I understand that this is a frustrating and confusing time for you, and that when people are going through difficult times they do things that might not make sense to people who are just observing them.

I wasn't trying to infer that blame for any of this sits squarely on the shoulders of any of the involved people, but rather that there are many many layers to communication in a relationship, and that both people involved have a degree of responsibility for the events that make it successful or not.

That's the thing. It doesn't have to be something horrible. You are dealing with somebody who has a personality disorder. That is a key building block to a human. If something is wrong with it, it can be triggered by anything. It's all about the individual, the trauma, the people they are talking with, what they are thinking, what they are hearing, the lighting, smells, flavours, etc etc etc. It drills down and down and keeps going and when you think you've got a handle on it, no. It's still worse. There is still something further in.

A good example of this would be me reading your post and typing out my admittedly overly aggressive post. It was a reaction to a trigger. That's what happens when you deal with people who's brains are fundamentally different. For what it's worth I do apologise. I understand that you were upset, I don't necessarily feel like you deserved any of this, and I really do hope that you get back on track.

Be proud that you had the balls to have that conversation in the first place, because that's something plenty of neurotypical people still struggle with well into adulthood!

Second, it's good that you're aware that you've been mistreated by him. That means that you can allow the sadness to come with a grain of salt, because you know it was best at the end of the day.

Don't beat yourself up too hard about how you specifically acted in the moment. This was kind of a break up, which is hard to deal with! Many people would likely have handled it the same way you did. It's okay that you didn't quite know how to feel in that moment, because it was sudden and hard to hear.

Overall, allow yourself to be sad about the parts you're going to miss, but never stop reminding yourself of the parts that you not only wouldn't miss, but **didn't deserve at all**. 

Real feelings will reciprocate themselves back to you :). And it seems like you're better off without this negative energy in your life, even if it's painful in this moment. 

My ex is a pwBPD, and she would get physically, emotionally, and verbally abusive to me when she would split. And even after all that, I had a terrible time with feeling sad and lonely after I ended the relationship. For the record she's still my best friend, just not my girlfriend anymore.

Bottom line is these things take time to fully process! You'll get there.

I just want to make my position clear that intentionally playing the ""games"", as you put it, is manipulation, plain and simple and, in my opinion, should not be advised to those with symptoms of BPD.   

I will say no more on the subject except to try to make it clear to you that what you seem to be advising, on the face of it, is manipulative behavior, however innocuous that might initially seem. It happens, of course, I'm not arguing that, but I cannot abide someone giving advice in this manner (especially to people with symptoms of BPD) without saying something, because manipulative behavior only deepens the stigma that many, *many* BPD sufferers face.  

For the avoidance of doubt: I believe avoiding fixation of someone else's phone call, text, attention, approval and focusing on one's own mental health is, in general, a healthy approach to avoiding unhealthy dependence - obviously. But specifically crafting strategies intended to subtly or harshly manipulate the other party in reaction to, and in an attempt to stave off, a feeling of dependence on said party, or intentionally mirroring them, in order to gain some traction in a relationship will not only lead one further down that rabbit hole of dependence, but will also sow the seeds of contempt and volatility in that relationship, whether it be romantic or platonic or anything in between.

Remember, take fault for your actions and NOT your feelings. You control your actions NOT your feelings. Your feelings are really just a way for your brain to tell you to pay attention.

First off, take a few deep breaths. Try to step back and look at the bigger picture here. There's a lot that could be going on and I don't know your situation, but this may not be so much the transition's fault, and it may help to know that. Sometimes, when we have BPD, if we're having a hard time, we blame recent big changes and assign them as the cause when they're not. Transition doesn't usually cause this kind of issue. You may be feeling a lot of upset right now because of things like unaccepting family or friends, and sometimes it can be easy to put those reactions on yourself. 

On the other hand, maybe you're discovering that transitioning, at least in the ways you are currently, isn't working for you, and that's okay too. Most aspects of a transition are un-doable if you find that that's the case. 

Regardless, everything seems really hard right now and you've got a lot to work out, but things can be okay. Regret could just be that you're feeling pressure from others to view things negatively, or it could be an indicator that this isn't the path for you. Regardless, you are good, and things can be alright. It might take time and it might take work, but it can feel better than it does right now.

I‚Äôve found that my antidepressants/anti anxiety meds helped a lot with feeling like I, a square peg, was successfully masquerading as a round one....

Not sure if I have any concrete advice, but tbh being in this sub, cptsd, and bpdmemes have REALLY been comforting for me. There are so many people here who feel the way we do, who have experienced life the way we have. 

Also, I know this is like saying ‚Äújust relax!!!‚Äù To an anxious person lol, but when you start to feel ashamed about not sharing, just remember that you don‚Äôt HAVE to. If there‚Äôs a person in your life that you feel truly deserves an explanation that delves into your diagnosis, and maybe telling them would help them reframe your actions more positively, and you feel comfortable doing it, then go for it. 

Otherwise, I remind myself that there are way more neurodivergent people than ‚Äúneurotypical‚Äù! Most people don‚Äôt feel the need to give excuses for their behavior. One of the symptoms of bpd is feeling shame/regret about our outbursts etc! So I think most of us (at least I do) have that urge to tell people, to give them an explanation. If you feel they deserve it, please don‚Äôt think you shouldn‚Äôt! But if you truly feel that that person would hold it against you, it may be better to save that sharing for us + your therapist/therapy group.

[],,Ohnoidiot,,,[],,,,text,t2_98aap6ti,False,False,[],"I too can identify with this. I see a lot of posts in that group that make me feel disgusting. The day after I was diagnosed I went online and that was the first forum I saw regarding BPD. I spent days crying.

You are not other people‚Äôs experiences. And you are not responsible for them feeling the way they feel. When people are hurt things can become so twisted in their head, and when online in an essentially anonymous subreddit people‚Äôs extreme pain or hatred comes out. Unfortunately, that group is full of people not so much looking for support, but looking to vent or place blame people with a diagnosis rather than their unique or specific situation. It feels unfair, and is absolutely awful to talk about other people that way, but once again, pain will make people say and do extreme things.

I know that in my last relationship I felt so hurt by the things he did and said to me, it was hell for two years and I have been dealing with it since it all happened. However I know that the situation‚Äôs relationship to our mental landscapes were not the initial problems, and that I am a person first, not just a person with BPD, and I know that he was a person first too, not just a person with major depressive disorder and a compulsive liar. In that other subreddit (and even in this one) that is forgotten and even taken for granted. 

Humans look for meaning and it is almost a compulsion for many to find resolve in situations that have ended in trauma in order to heal. And so in those posts a lot of those people NEED to attach their pain and suffering to their partner‚Äôs BPD. It‚Äôs not right, and it‚Äôs not fair, but it is what it is. I know that when I was coming to terms with what happened to me with my ex after we broke up I felt so horrible and couldn‚Äôt understand why what had happened happened I felt such anger and such deep, deep hatred for both him and myself.

Not everyone thinks this way forever though, I know that I‚Äôve healed with time. Those people are just hurt and need to vent, but they don‚Äôt represent anyone other than themselves, and even then, they might not be totally in their right mind in those situations either. Just like I haven‚Äôt been in the past.

In terms of the people and posts in this subreddit, I too am disturbed at a lot of people‚Äôs self-acceptance (and almost pride) in their extreme feelings or behaviours, whether it be abuse or toxic thoughts. They too, do not represent all people that deal with BPD, and their experiences are their experiences only. Blaming shitty behaviour on a mental illness does not excuse the shitty behaviour, and such shitty behaviour does not always overlap with their BPD. 

Everyone is different and everyone‚Äôs experience with their own BPD is also different. I know that I don‚Äôt do things that a lot of people posting do, and in the past when I have acted rash I have never found pride or been grateful in my actions or this mental illness in the moment, or in retrospect. 

Mental health issues (obviously including BPD) primarily impact the way you think, and the way you think (can) dictate how you act at times. You do not have to be a bad person to have BPD. You do not have to do horrible things to have BPD. You do not have to be toxic or have toxic behaviours to have BPD.

People who have BPD we go into states like happy sad or mad to the extremes with very little grey. But our world functions in the grey area, watching his videos helped me to be more mindful of what it is I'm actually feeling so i can react appropriately. Maybe I'm not mad, but I'm annoyed, and mad is the only way I've expressed. Maybe I'm hurt, don't know how to express that, or I'm just feeling burnt out and not actually sad. Learning to distinguish our emotions is so important not just for ourself but others. 
I also want to say, that your partner needs to learn, or get proper help or even begin watching videos and etc. to cope properly during the stressful situations, and not just expect you to help him. I know it's so hard for us, but it's the only way for us to practice new and healthy habits.

BPD people can be that way of cruel and kind because it's often a validation seeking technique, so that we know our loved ones won't abandon us, Unfortunately it backfires. 
As someone with BPD, who is currently everyday trying my best to regulate my emotions etc, it is really really hard. It's not easy and it's not fun for me, but i realized that if i really care about the people i care for, then i need to be trying my best to not affect them with my disorder.

I was really worried about the medication thing too. But I was lucky enough to be referred to a psychiatrist who is incredible, she always listens to what I am saying and helps me adjust accordingly. 

I am on 5 medications, which can seem kind of crazy BUT I have come to terms with it because it truly helps me feel so much better. I talk to my psych every 2 to 3 weeks to talk about symptoms im struggling with and she suggests a few different meds to try and what they do and we decide together which to try first. Its a process to find the ones that work best. If I am reacting strongly to them, I can call her office and we figure it out immediately. 

The first one we started for me was too tackle the depression and borderline rage I was experiencing. It helped heaps. The second prescribed to me was to help my vivid nightmares and trouble with sleep. The third was to address the dissociation I was experiencing. The 4th because I was still really depressed and just didn't have the energy or motivation to do anything at all. The 5th to help with constant severe panic attacks. At the end of the month ill wean of the first one so ill be down to 4.

They are all helping so much. There's no one specific fix all med for bpd unfortunately, but a good psych will help you to find the best combo for your specific needs. Its worth it. Its worth feeling better. Its not like it makes me not borderline anymore, cause meds can't fix everything, we still have to put in the work to heal. Its a hard journey, but people do recover!

The way I like to look at it is, for BPD, meds are supposed to take the edge off so you can use the skills. The skills are the where the real progress is made.

I'm not gonna lie I find that to be rather discouraging because I have had a lot of trouble using skills, but I still believe it and I won't give up.

I think this one boils down to, what do you two expect from the friendship and what expectations you have for the other and I think it's good to have an open conversation about this. When a honest conversation is had about what each expect of the other as a friend then feelings like ""but that person wasn't there for me back then"" or ""but that person said this once upon a time"" will be less likely to crop up. Also this will be a moment where both of you can set boundries  
Reading about BPD is good(I have no special books I recommend), but it will only get you so far, because BPD is very personal and different for each person and how BPD affects her you can only learn by talking to her about it if she's open for it. Be prepared that it's a jumbled mess at times, some people are further in their treatment than other's, but it will also be an eye-opener often not just for you, but also for the person that has BPD(like I have a more quiet BPD and I sometimes just shut down when certain things happen, but there are other moments where I don't and I'll be the opposite of what I usually would do and it's up to me to recognize; oh I'm not okay right now, what do I need right now to feel better? Sometimes I wish BPD was a cut and dry disorder, because then I always would know what to do, but it's not.)   

2.  Therapy is always good when you feel you need help in further evolving and yes, therapy can probably help in communicating your feelings, instead of bottling them up, but I bottle myself, so I'm not the expert on this(in therapy myself).

One of the difficulties with this kind of brain, is we set expectations, 'he will leave me (because I'm worthless/unlovable/etc) even if he says he won't'.

Already we have kind of 'set the stage' to replicate our prior abandonment.

One of the first things i learned in auto racing is to NOT FOCUS ON THE TAILLIGHTS OF THE CAR IN FRONT.  Invariably, we tend to move towards our focus.  In the case of auto racing, i feared hitting the car in front, but when I focused on the back of that car, *that's exactly where I went*.

I learned to focus to either side of that car, to picture myself and my vehicle fitting snugly right up beside that other car.  To focus on where i wanted to be, rather than where i didn't.

Honestly, a lot easier with racing than relationships.

But it still holds true.  We replicate our prior abandonments by setting an expectation that we will be abandoned again (because we might feel worthless), this fear results in actions that tend to push people away from us, which only redoubles and confirms our fear that we will be abandoned when we eventually are.  It's like a cursed bootstrap that just keeps tightening.

Breaking the cycle is easy with racing.  With relationships, harder.  I try radical acceptance as much as I can.

Of course, in my case, it took MDMA for me to feel love for myself and any sense of self worth.  That was almost a year ago now, and I've tried to hold onto it as much as I can.

[],,NoTearsLeftToCry13,,,[],,,,text,t2_1a0gfhtd,False,False,[],"I definitely relate to you. My gf of over a year recently broke up with me on Valentine‚Äôs day. Everything started going downhill exactly a week ago. We had an incident where she asked for space and I freaked out because I knew she was mad at me for something minor I did. The next day she came over and had a four paged letter of things that bothered her throughout our relationship that she held in. At one point she compared me to my abusive mother. I couldn‚Äôt effectively respond to her so I asked her to come four days later (Friday night) so that I could share my thoughts and problem solving ideas with her. That night, at midnight on Valentines day she broke things off in an emotionless state. It absolutely broke me. I asked her to get her crap that she left in her apartment that following Tuesday and we made up. She said she was willing to work on everything that we problem solved and the mistakes she made. Then she was still anxious about everything so I asked her to come with me to my individual therapy appointment on Thursday. This is where things got super bad. She said she wanted to wait a month to see if she wanted to continue the relationship because her mental health was bad. I was not willing to wait a month since she just flip flopped on me 3 times within a week so i said I can do a week or two weeks max. She said she can do two weeks. So that was the plan. Then she comes back later that night with my belongings to tell me that she hooked up with a stranger on Tinder despite promising to my face that she wouldn‚Äôt. She uses unhealthy coping mechanism like sex, alcohol, vaping, etc. And I tried my absolute best to try and help her quit that stuff. And tried to give her so many chances to change but she blew it. 

Needless to say, I am in the same or a super similar boat you are in. I have been struggling a lot lately being alone. My friends have been great supports to me during this time and it still feels like there is a gaping hole in my heart. If I didn‚Äôt have abandonment and attachment issues I would probably be hooking up with other people or back on Tinder already. But I do genuinely want to focus on myself right now, as hard as that is. I want to be able to have a healthy relationship despite my issues. I also have been distracting myself quite a bit from the situation, especially since I tend to ruminate. Some ways I have been doing this is by making plans with friends, doing school work, etc. Some moments are incredibly hard like earlier when I was getting my second dose of the COVID vaccine. I went with my ex to get the first one and then was reminded of her when I saw different places we had good times at. My biggest advice for you is to try and focus on self care at this time. Make sure you drink enough water. Eat even if it‚Äôs something small. Take a nice shower or bath. If you have animals, play or cuddle with them. Watch a favorite movie or TV show. Also if you are comfortable, try spending time with friends to remind yourself that your relationship was not the sole support you have. This is one of the biggest things that is helping me. Also, engage in opposite action if you want to contact them. This has been vital in my case since she intentionally hurt me by cheating on me and even admitted that she knew it would hurt me. I cannot go back to her because she is toxic yet it is so hard to not go back. I‚Äôm so used to getting hurt because of being in an abusive household and because I truly love her it takes so much to not try and fix everything.

I understand all your anxieties with the intepersonal interactions so I think what helped me maintain that income stream for so long is that I was my own boss and while I still had anxieties with clients ... it wasn‚Äôt as bad as having to deal with boss and coworkers and because I viewed it as ‚Äújust my income‚Äù I didn‚Äôt feel the same pressure to fit into the role or make others like me.

I would just try to view your job as just something you have to do rather than something that defines who you are or has a bearing on your self worth.  try to choose the job based on pragmatic concerns like minimizing stress and triggers.   a good job is one that naturally can accommodate your BPD challenge rather than something you have to fit into.

The worst case scenario is you have BPD and you can start working on it. Best case scenario is you‚Äôve spent a bit of time and money ruling out BPD (for now, anyway... the traits can come and go with stress).

My BPD was misdiagnosed / under diagnosed as Bipolar, depression, anxiety, panic disorder, ocd, alcohol use disorder, and probably more I don‚Äôt remember. But I always knew something wasn‚Äôt right and none of those diagnoses clicked with me and all of the treatments were bandaids that were ultimately ineffective at dealing with the root issue. If I could‚Äôve been diagnosed earlier I might‚Äôve avoided some of the negative events in my life. 

Anyway, therapists and doctors don‚Äôt want to diagnose BPD because it‚Äôs a major illness and it‚Äôs difficult to treat. They‚Äôd rather give you a simple diagnosis, and psychiatrists have been told for generations that people with BPD shouldn‚Äôt be treated or told about their illness. It‚Äôs messed up, and I think it could be a human rights issue someday. 

You know your body and mind and you can push back against these people because they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on in your head. Don‚Äôt let them gaslight you. At the very least they should make a follow up appointment to asses you or offer a referral.

[],,Agertudici,,,[],,,,text,t2_17hdw6,False,True,[],"You have to develop some kind of routine and practice it. For some people that is not being in their room for the day but there are other options. Also you could try sitting at a desk or in a chair instead of in the bed. You may be able to find a decent desk and chair secondhand for cheap.

You can change the Sensory input of the room during the day vs at night. Curtains open during the day for vision (full spectrum white light lamps are abt $50 on Amazon if you live somewhere with little sunlight like the NW US or near the Arctic circle), upbeat music for sound,  coffee or tea or chewing gum for taste, and either a simulating essential oil like citrus or keep the coffee grounds in a cup for smell. For touch it may help to do some light exercise like stretching or yoga, but also I recommend putting on real clothes. For instance I have a hard time studying if I'm not wearing a bra.

At night do a lot of the opposite. Get the room as dark as possible, close the curtains, cover any electronic lights. Change your bulbs to yellow/orange spectrum LEDs if possible (opposite the white lamp) should be about $5 per bulb. I'm a huge HUGE fan of white noise for sleep because it's highly portable. I sleep to a raging thunderstorm on my phone every night and it covers everything from voices to footsteps and banging, and I can take it anywhere, hotels, other people's homes, the hospital, I'm good. You can find apps and just mp3 recordings. For smell try lavender or chamomile. Don't use a candle or wax heater while you're asleep as it's a fire risk you would need some kind of actual diffuser but again they're not super expensive. For taste I recommend a single cup of herbal (read: caffeine free) tea an hour before bed. Any closer to bedtime and you may have to pee in the middle of the night. You could also try a light snack like a small chocolate but chocolate does have a small amount of caffeine and any large amount of food will keep you up. For touch try a weighted blanket or your pajamas.

The other thing is your brain will change track faster if you have separating rituals like a sun salutation when you wake up or journaling and having that cup of tea before bed. Reinforce with the above Sensory experiences to pack a little extra punch.

If you do decide to use medication, remember that anything anything ANYTHING your body must be trained to respond to. If you fight your meds they will stop working. As soon as your eyes and limbs even start to get heavy after taking your meds immediately to to bed every time. Fighting their meds is how people end up on stupid unsafe doses of sleeping meds. Melatonin in particular your body will not respond to at all if you don't condition yourself to.

Actually, the whole ""favorite person"" phenomenon experienced by people with BPD was one of the first ""symptoms"" I consciously experienced. (To digress, I know FPs aren't a diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5 so spare me) I was 16. His name was Kenny. At first I thought I just had a crush but I could not get him out of my head and my life basically revolved around him for a while. Then I moved on to my next FP. In total, I've had like five FP's over the last four years? What makes it even better is all of my FP's tend to be oh-so-unavailable. 60% were married! I consider myself a very moral person, so that didn't bode well for me. In any respect, now that I'm more conscious of my thoughts and feelings, I can usually feel the FP vibe coming on. It starts with a mild crush (he's pretty cute) and after being around them for a while, they start to grow on me. Then I experience a wave of euphoria and that's the first warning sign. This is the least-distressing part of the development of a FP, for me. As you can tell, I usually only idealize people who I find attractive. In an effort to ""neutralize"" these feelings, I'll often act standoffish around them and avoid them, which... doesn't help. I'm already hooked. I can *act* like they don't mean so much to me, but they do, and these mixed signals as manifested by my behavior towards these individuals, I assume, can be very confusing to the poor soul placed on that pedestal. Then, my FP does something that I perceive as rejection or abandonment, and I devalue them. Then I regret whatever I've done to them and apologize. Until they're tired of me. I'm still working on mitigating this pattern. Mind you, my latest FP that finally got tired of my ass occured at the onset of my getting help, so I hope to find some coping skills to help mitigate  this because I would like to eventually start a family.

Exactly, so why expect people to hold to outdated conventions of using he/him pronouns? This is a place for people to share experiences, vent, etc, from their own personal experiences and in whatever way they choose to express themselves.

My FP also struggles with mental illness issues, but he never understands that it's not the same as being BPD. One day he had the audacity to say to my face ""just because you're BPD don't undermine other people with mental illnesses like it's some kind of a competition"". I swear to go I just wanted to yell ""IT'S NOT THE SAME BRUH!"" just like you.

Also addressing what he said, no it's not a competition, but it is what it is. Being BPD is a lot harder than what people think it is. We don't enjoy or get something out of having it or trying to make others understand how we feel all the time. We just want people around us to know that when we say we're struggling, you just see the tip of the iceberg. We're not just depressed or anxious or sad. There's a lot more to it. And we have a very hard time getting something out, let alone compete. Also when my FP says he's struggling, I completely understand what's going on with him (and he had said I do himself) and that's exactly how I know it's not the same.

Getting on top of your mental health is an achievement in itself, but I do understand the need to master something, and there is actually a DBT skill called ‚Äúbuilt mastery‚Äù.

There are a lot of skills you can make really quick progress with to give you a bit of a confidence boost, for example learning a language or instrument. These are things that you will get better at with consistent practice, say 10-30 minutes a day.

[],,serenwipiti,,,[],,,,text,t2_glnc4,False,False,[],"While I hear you and understand what you're saying, I'd like to mention that at no point did I say that ""pwbpd are just addicts"". That's a gross generalization. 

If you take a look, I said ""for *many* pwBPD"", because in life there are few absolutes. Everyone is different and from what I understand, not all pwBPD even have a FP. 

*All* humans display certain behaviors based on the chemical responses that occur in their brains. It's one of the reasons why babies and mothers bond when breast feeding and why our heart starts beating faster when our crush walks by. 

People that suffer from BPD are absolutely capable of and do have mutually fulfilling friendships- which can, depending on age and lifestyle, be rare for many people. 

My point is that, taking into account the fact that BPD brains are wired in a way that responds to average situations with stronger than average emotional arousal- it would not surprise me if some of these bonds, those referred to as ""FP"" are more similar to an addiction- and because of this, for better or worse, they might feel more enthusiastic or passionate about these relationships than the average person. 


What do I mean by addiction? 

Here's a fictional example with a romantic FP: the pwBPD might create a narrative in their head about the other person (idealization), they put the other person on a pedestal and the second they do something that does not align with their desired narrative they tear them down as if they were all bad (splitting)...in this example,lets say that the pwBPD then regrets their actions, and misses the feeling they got from their interactions with and their construct of who/what that other person is. They proceed to love bomb and chameleon themselves to conform to what their FP would love. The process, which is a kind of chase, could lead to tiny bursts of adrenaline. Eventually, they reel them back in. Boom, dopamine rush.

People often complain of being bored in ""regular"" relationships after breaking up with BPD's, and this is a completely unfounded theory, but perhaps there's something addictive to this cycle of push and pull, both between the two people and within the pwBPD's self.

He's blocked you, meaning he does not want to hear from you. You need to respect this boundary. 

&gt;I also looked up his mom‚Äôs phone number online  

This is bordering stalking territory. I would really advise against this kind of behavior. It may seem small, bu it could lead to more serious ways of contacting him which end up being harassment. 

I understand he hurt you and I can't imagine how hurtful it must have felt that he wouldn't leave his student organization despite them bullying you. That's a massive betrayal. However, it shows he is not the right person for you - and that's OK. Do you have a therapist? I suggest you talk to them about this. You have to learn to move on from this relationship. You cannot control whether or not he wants you back. No matter how much you beg and plead and prove to him you want the relationship, he has his right to refuse. What you can do is control your actions and learn to accept that this relationship is not going to happen.

BPD can be debilitating at times, just know that as you get more mature and experienced you will be able to set better boundaries and it will be more stable.

Know that your awareness of right and wrongs and the guilt you feel right now shows how much a genuine and good person you are.

Taking space after an unfair verbal lashing is the right thing to do. 

And showing her that you aren't abandoning her in that process will do more for her growth than you can imagine.

Since she's diagnosed then she's on a great step to recovery. While sharing resources are helpful, you might want to stay away from giving unsolicited advice.

One emerging topic of research is actually on what changes the carers of people with BPD can implement to improve their relationship and reduce their burnout.

For instance, this study ( DOI: [10.1521/pedi\_2018\_32\_340](https://doi.org/10.1521/pedi_2018_32_340) ) employed group psychoeducation and focused on improving relationship patterns, psychoeducation about the disorder, peer support and self-care, and skills to reduce burden. 

They found that carers of people with BPD in the intervention reported improvements in the person with BPD, better relationship dynamics, and improved emotional stability.

I can send you the research paper for you to review, but I recall that **part** of the intervention involved teaching carers of people with BPD to:

1.  Be non-judgmental, validating, attentive and appropriate.

2.  Reduce their reactivity and try to remain calm and ‚Äúmindful.‚Äù

3.  Attend to their own needs through staying connected with friends and family, attending to their own physical and mental health, and taking breaks.

4.  Model appropriate assertiveness and setting appropriate boundaries and ground rules for the relationship.

5.  Get outside help when crises arise and having a crisis plan.

&amp;#x200B;

I think people with BPD tend to cling onto this notion that if they invalidate their feelings and themselves enough then they would be able to better emotionally self-regulate. And they also pick partners who also believe that the best way to help someone with BPD is to invalidate the person with BPDs ~~""irrational""~~ feelings and emotions.

**Emotional dysregulation &amp; fear of abandonment tends to be a consequence of chronic internal and chronic external invalidation.** 

One more time....

**Emotional dysregulation &amp; fear of abandonment tends to be a consequence of chronic internal and chronic EXTERNAL invalidation.** 

So giving someone the diagnoses seems:

If you‚Äôre looking for advice, I‚Äôd first examine if a critique is constructive or not. If it isn‚Äôt, then it isn‚Äôt really worth your time.

Just because another person feels it and expresses it, doesn‚Äôt mean that their perception of this is true for you.

Use FAST to maintain a good relationship with the person, but also stand up for yourself. Listen more to what the other person says, but again remain a sort of ‚Äúboundary bubble‚Äù since this person is not all knowing of your experience.

I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of, uh, I think 6 or 7? So, ADHD has a lot of similarities to BPD. I was always impulsive. Always hold friends a bit too dear to me. &amp; I was always very sensitive to rejection (called RSD (Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria) in ADHD)

So I'd say.. I was always the way I am now. But I suppose due to how my mom handled my ADHD, it turned into BPD. She absolutely couldn't handle the impulsivity (which is understandable honestly) so she used ways of trying to discipline me that she shouldn't have. 

I'm not going to explain the similarities between ADHD and BPD since everyone can just look them up themselves lmao! 

I think around the ages of 11-12 I became depressed. 13-15 were really strong BPD moments. I didn't even know I had it at this point. I would cry every night for hours, would self harm &amp; look  for attention from others. I had every day arguments with my mother, fullly  screaming at each other. 

I went to the mental hospital at the age of 13 the first time; for 3 weeks. The reason why I left was because of a mood switch that I had. Thinking back, that was definitely BPD. Out of nowhere I went from suicidal to ""well, it's not that bad actually"" - until it was back again. Next time I went to mental hospital because I was actually forced to. I have not been going to school, so half a year later they demanded a letter for me to include a proper reason or else I would've been punished by being thrown into jail. Well I was having a huge anger episode, so I wrote that if anyone forces me to go to school I would murder them all (yikes HAHA)

From there, I barely even went to school. I'm 19 now and I don't have any school degree at all. I tried 3 times to get it back, but I always dropped it. 

When I turned 17 I started drinking. That went out of control quite fast, as I was drinking almost weekly. I've had periods of not drinking anymore, they were usually 3-4 months. By the time I was 18, I would drink continuously vodka. There was 2 month period where I was drinking 3-4 times a week. For now my drinking issue got a lot less - mainly because I fear the calories in there. A few months I turned 18 I developed an eating disorder. Well, I'd say I've always had disordered eating - but this was the time it because ""serious"" &amp; more of a long-term thing. Especially after I started to willingly throw up my food. 

I've had lots of bad moments, but I think my worst one's were in my ex-relationship. I held myself at a distance with everyone I was talking to before that (to avoid lashing out at the people), so being really close to someone was obviously overwhelming. I got used to it overtime. Then the arguments started happening because I wasn't happy with the way I felt treated. I really tried to hold back irrational thoughts, but I was spiraling out of my control in this relationship. Beginning 2019 I tried to commit suicide 3 times in 3-4 months. After 6-7 months into the relationship, we started to have constant fights. 

September 2019 my family called an ambulance because I said I was going to kill myself. I was really drunk during that time &amp; I don't remember half of what happened. So I was in another mental hospital (ironically this one is 100 meters away from me - didn't even know it was a mental hospital HAHA). I think around 2017 I've always guessed I had BPD. I was really sure of it and lots of my BPD homies were telling me to get that diagnosed. In this hospital I got diagnosed with BPD &amp; and somewhat of an alcohol dependancy. During this time my relationship was extremely strained. And it continued to be like that until I broke up (which I highly regret now) 

Fast forward to now - where I'm standing. Few days ago I had one of my worst mental breakdowns due to my desperate need for love. I texted my ex &amp; obviously he didn't give me that love. My BPD convinced me he would - so I got basically soulcrushed with that reality. The next day I had another mental breakdown - asking him to come back. He didn't say yes or not - but that change really needs to happen before we start the relationship again. This gave me push to actively work on myself. 

I've been trying to understand myself for a few weeks now - but now I'm always thinking about my actions &amp; my BPD. I am actively engaging in my thoughts and feelings. It feels good, I gotta tell you!

Therapist after therapist telling me to turn off the tapes in my head, and me asking where the hell I find an off switch!  We internalize so much crap when we are kids, that we don‚Äôt even recognize that the thoughts were implanted and not even really our own. 

My brother, who also has BPD, will go on and on about our abusive childhood. Inevitably I‚Äôll say that other kids had it much worse and he gets angrier. He says the trauma we experienced was bad enough for us, we shouldn‚Äôt be comparing. We‚Äôve both been told we have PTSD and I was told that I‚Äôve lived my life in ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù for so long I‚Äôm in a permanent state of adrenaline high. But still I have this guilt, this feeling that I‚Äôm feeling sorry for myself and others had it worse or have it worse now. I look at my husband and son who have PTSD from being combat vets, or people who have PTSD from rape and assault, and think they are worse off than me and I have nothing to complain about. As if being beaten black and blue and having a knife held to my throat aren‚Äôt enough to cause PTSD in a child. 

So, OP, yes, if you were abused or traumatized as a child, you do have PTSD. Others may have had worse childhoods, but that doesn‚Äôt not lessen the trauma you‚Äôve lived thru.

Being eligible for medication doesn‚Äôt really make much sense in regards to BPD because it‚Äôs pretty well known that the disorder doesn‚Äôt really respond to medications, it‚Äôs more likely you have comorbid depression/anxiety and that‚Äôs what the medication is for.

I‚Äôm also a high-functioning BPD sufferer but the psychological pain is the defining feature that stays no matter how high or low your resilience is at any time. 

Another key feature of BPD is intense, volatile interpersonal relationships because of this psychological suffering and fear of abandonment. Along with that comes ‚Äúsplitting‚Äù, where one minute you adore and love your partner/friend/family, and after one minor transgression you can‚Äôt stand them and think they‚Äôre a terrible person - you mentioned you tend to see everyone around you in a positive light, which doesn‚Äôt really follow this pattern.

It‚Äôs worth noting as well that doing DBT with a therapist doesn‚Äôt indicate or imply a diagnosis of BPD. There are aspects of DBT such as radical acceptance, distress tolerance and emotion regulation that can be helpful for many other mental health disorders, not just BPD.

So for example, I've hurt some people in my life and I have to accept that I can't go into the past to change this, so there's no point beating myself up about my past actions over and over. However, I can recognise  that there are some things I can change - maybe I can try to hurt people less in the future by addressing the issues that cause me to be,  for example, manipulative at times. 

Coming to terms with the fact that I can be manipulative takes a lot of self-compassion, otherwise I would just shame myself to hell for even possessing such a trait. These days I try to not judge myself so immediately and recognise that yeh I might have this thing about me that I hate, but it doesn't define my whole being. I choose to accept that I am the way I am for a lot of reasons and I am going to actively work towards being less manipulative by getting to the root of the problem. This is a form of self-compassion. 

A part of yourself might always want to tell you that you don't deserve to be accepted, that you really are a horrible being underneath everything - but that is a form of toxic shame. I've found some good Youtube videos by Dr Fox that have really helped me understand this and seperate the toxic shame voice from my own voice. The voice is still there but I can step back a bit from it instead of believing it all the time. 

It can be really scary getting to know yourself but I think once you let go of the fear and self-judgement, curiosity will take over and then exploring who you are will feel more like a detective adventure haha.",,1589155325,{},fq7zd12,False,t3_ggvzle,False,True,t1_fq6tyi5,/r/BPD/comments/ggvzle/unstable_sense_of_self_makes_me_believe_i_dont/fq7zd12/,1589159637,1,True,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,0,[],,,,,

I'm just basing this off my experience with people who were diagnosed with acute psychoses. Changes in visual perception, like perceiving the room as longer/smaller, are quite common. I think I've also heard about EEGs/PET scans of brains of people on psychedelics resembling the activity of brains under psychosis (as in too much connectivity I think), and faces are one of the first things that start to look ""off"" when you're on acid or shrooms. Seeing how people with BPD are also at higher risk of psychosis I just guessed. Therapist might recognize the symptom. Could be depersonalization for all I know, since you say you felt out of it and not real. Might be nothing serious and go away on its own when you're less stressed. 

Definitely keep an eye on it tho. And only let them prescribe you antipsychotics if you absolutely can't function without them.

Edit: just skimmed through your active subs and you seem to be into psychedelics as well. If you're currently tripping or coming down from a trip don't worry about the faces and just try to distract yourself somehow.  It's probably gonna be fine once you've slept.

If you did do psychedelics these past couple days definitely lay them off for a while and give your mind a chance to settle. I believe acid can be wonderfully therapeutic but if you're having strange thoughts and changes in perception when sober it's a good indicator you should rest a bit.

If you're a druggy like me and can get your hand on some benzos, they work well to get you off bad trips. Antipsychotics work even better. They're so powerful I had a friend who was on a steady dose of antibiotics do 200ug and stay completely sober. He didn't notice a thing.

So I have borderline and I've participated in treating some borderlines in various levels of acuity from full blown crisis to more long term maintainence care. I think I know what they mean but the way you've expressed here that your Psychiatrist and therapist stated it has some big overstatements (also it isn't just me this is a feeling I've discussed and witnessed in coworkers as well and seen in clinical discussions of borderline).

Frequently when someone has borderline people (including professionals) will feel a very fast and very strong reaction, whether it's love or hate. Like, I think I know exactly the gut feeling they're talking about. I'll meet someone and we'll just hit it off like we've known each other for years. I get the intense distaste occasionally, but it's usually the immediate magnetism. I have it myself, and it can be kind of surreal to watch it work on other people because a certain kind of person will just latch on to me and praise me intensely and I'm like nononono. First of all I'm trying to have healthy relationships with good boundaries these days. But second, that's the magnetic sociopathy you're responding to and you need to learn to learn healthy boundaries... like I spent three years doing... get with the program.

It's gotten to the point that sometimes, especially at work, when I feel a sudden deep connection to someone it sort of raises the hairs on the back of my neck, because often that intense connection indicates someone in some kind of serious emotional crisis and it can quickly be followed by rapidly cycling emotions. A particular experience comes to mind where the patient would cycle between making aggressive sexual comments and apologizing every five or so minutes and fortunately I had had enough experience at that time that I felt that initial feeling and knew what it meant and I knew exactly what to do, but maintaining a neutral but slightly supportive affect throughout thoroughly exhausted me within a matter of hours.

For people who don't have training or experience with this, the situation can get out of control very quickly, and they may develop a gnawing apprehension when faced with this feeling in the future, which ironically enough makes it harder for them to manage the situation. This feeling certainly puts me on alert, but at least I know vaguely how I'm going to proceed in a way that keeps me and my patient safe and as psychosocially intact as possible considering the circumstances.

The big issue I have with the way your Psychiatrist and therapist stated it is that it doesn't objectively mean the patient has borderline. It could be any number of things but the two big culprits (aside from borderline) are mania and a serious life crisis. People will just act like that sometimes when their mom gets hit by a car and has a day to live, it's just outside of borderline, the behavior goes away after some time. Also I've met borderlines without it, especially if they're less acutely ill, lower severity overall, or progressing through recovery. All of these people still have borderline, but won't flag for this feeling.

Sometimes even my brain flags it incorrectly and I have to sort of patiently wait it out and see, especially with new friends. I've met a lot of neurodivergent friends that my now trained reptile brain has flagged as potential boundary pushers because they're just really intense people. They're people that are probably on the edge of the borderline spectrum but have just good enough coping skills that they don't quite meet the criteria. I usually tell them explicitly like ""hey I can tell you're a really intense person and I'm 100% down with that as long as you don't push my boundaries."" And I watch for boundary violations, but other than that I try to allow the relationship to advance as much as I'd normally be comfortable.

Because that's the thing about this feeling. It's not a red flag on it's own. It can alert you to the possibility of some difficult to manage behaviors, but it's not even a solid predictor of those, let alone any kind of diagnostic tool.",,1589152003,{},fq7tpi5,False,t3_ggy8lm,False,True,t3_ggy8lm,/r/BPD/comments/ggy8lm/was_told_by_psychiatrist_and_therapist_they_can/fq7tpi5/,1589156548,1,True,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,0,[],,1589152368.0,,,

Emotionally immature parenting poses a risk factor in developing BPD. But it can also not be obvious if physical abuse is again, absent. It goes undetected as something that can be negatively impactful on a child growing up. So there has to be some argument about genetics or whatever. Even BPD being ""passed down"" is better explained by parents who aren't managing their own BPD mirroring the unhealthy maladaptive coping mechanisms and world views to their child who is like a sponge to their parent's example and is more at risk to develop the disorder due to that. 

For me, my family is dysfunctional and not a lot of significant physical abuse happened. Except my dad did hit my siblings and I growing up but stopped when I reached my late elementary school years. Plus being mixed black and exposed to racial violence growing up, but having a family who were otherwise not super physically abusive towards me as a child has had me downplaying things because of the nature of BPD making me irrational and overly reactive at times. Then there is a lot of unhealed trauma and intergenerational trauma and such mingled in with some of the experiences of unintentionally being gaslighted. Parentification, parents projecting their unhealed traumas, parental alienation, have all had components of gaslighting involved. But the absence of serious physical abuse also sparks the doubt and then BPD's nature combined is what makes me gaslight my own upbringing a lot. Recently before covid-19 closed everything and I bailed on therapy, my therapist diagnosed me with ptsd or complex ptsd, and I downplayed my experiences because I'm also getting treatment for BPD and believed that things couldn't have been bad if my family never attacked me. I thought it's impossible because I ""always overreact"" and it is my fault for being the ""angry"" person my family insisted I was. But for that context, I was shy and quiet growing up and prone to anxiety more so than an angry temperament that wasn't normal or unusual for my age. My oldest sister negatively affected and sort of more severely parentified by both parents than I was mainly from our dad, would lash out at me growing up and gaslighted me. She'd say things never happened or she never said something when she'd name call and put me down. But she didn't lay a finger on me. There's also a 5 year difference between us and to this day now that we're both adults, she is sorry for some of those behaviors and remorseful.

The stereotyping is not unique to BPD and applies to other PD's as well.

Unlike race, sexuality, and religion, PD is usually not obvious to others unless (1) one is showing significant symptoms, (2) the audience is actually educated about the PD (which is rare), and/or (3) you volunteer that information up front (big no-no).

On your comment about how there are subs with people venting about their BPD ex, I'd say you should be careful about demonizing such people. While some may be bigots, many individuals really have been harmed by family and friends who suffered from BPD. My BPD uncle abused his mom, wife, and kids for years until they left him.

You might be right about the test. That is a common thing too. But the more often she does this specific thing, where she breaks up with you repeatedly and then you have a conversation with her that's likely emotionally draining, the more stress it will put on you.

Remember to take your needs into account as well. Is she well enough to actually meet them? Is she well enough to see this behavior for what it is and work on taking to you instead of making kneejerk decisions that could eventually be final if she keeps pushing?

One way or another, she needs to take responsibility for her behaviour. If you don't say that boundary, she will unintentionally become reliant on toxic behavior to cope.

If you want an easy to understand explanation of those differences, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUv-_3aiNTc&amp;t=8s) is a video of a psychologist talking about it. Beyond that, not all individuals who are diagnosed with BPD have experienced trauma, and many people will have overlap with PTSD.

I also disagree that BPD criteria are vague. They are highly varied, but in my experience they are the opposite of vague. Before my diagnosis, my treatment team knew about my trauma, my mood swings, and my difficulty around interpersonal situations, but there just wasn't enough specificity in my treatment to get anywhere. With BPD in particular, it was much easier to see what *specifically* was bothering me. 

I also have to firmly disagree with ""when someone with mental illness sees a problem, they change."" *Any* long-established behavioral pattern is difficult to change even *without* a mental illness tied to it. Beyond that, the [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4500179/) has shown that BPD improves with age, particularly when met with treatment. To say that folks with BPD can't change a behavior once they spot it is buying into outdated notions of what BPD is like which is furthering the stigma around the disorder.

Every summer I leave my university to go home to the Philippines for 3 months as well, and I have BPD. I always have to go home and it becomes worrisome because I feel like if I leave our relationship will be non-existent because he‚Äôs always had this attitude where ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not physically in front of me, you don‚Äôt exist to me.‚Äù He also has the touchy-feely/physical love language, that‚Äôs why he said this to me when I first went away. At first every point of my body would be on fire and I would get so hurt/upset/depressed but I had to learn to understand what he really meant was that he was struggling to combine three different social circles and that if he couldn‚Äôt respond right away it simply meant I had to be patient. The first year we did this temporary LDR we ended up breaking up because we were to immature to realize how to cope/manage my BPD in an LDR and the constant need for attention/reassurance. Eventually, as time moved on, he learned to understand that when I leave the country, it‚Äôs the time that I need him the most and require the most attention and check-ups. I helped him understand my needs as well as create a schedule for him to speak with me. We‚Äôve been together for a full year but on and off for three years, so it just takes some time and you need to help each other understand  how your BPD plays a role in your relationship as well as what your love languages are with each other through your LDR.

I think in your particular case, you should just communicate it out and find a time in both of your schedules to have a ‚Äútogether time‚Äù where no one can interfere as much as possible. Also, try to keep yourself as occupied as you can when they‚Äôre not talking to you or giving you their attention. I picked up a hobby of playing video games (League of Legends) because since each game lasts so long I can distract myself for long amounts of time and not even have the thought of not having any attention from my SO cross my mind. This might be super cliche, but also make sure that you talk to your SO about everything because communication is the most important thing in any LDR.

The self reliance instead of sense of being dependent on others really helped me the most but its hard to point at a specific thing i do ""right"" or ""better"", just rather than trying to focus i just moved away from distractions, and when i felt readyish last year (therapist has pushed, a lot) i went back to school, weathered the binge drinking incidents and just stuck to the plan when i wasnt a mess, and the bpd freakoyuts seem to have stopped although i carry a lot of thought habits i intend to show the door.

Now i fell trees when i want more money, the government pays me to do a bigger better version of a barley breeding trial i was gonna do for me on my plot anyway, and i grow most of my food in what i'm told humans call a ""living room"". The old behavioral patterns disappeared when i stopped getting triggered constantly by removing myself from situations that i couldnt control my behaviours in, rather than thinking id make progress on them from in them. My mechanic is briliant but ive never seen him work on a moving car.

So i left the world (talk about white male privilege) until i ran out of shitty emotions to process and gave humanity a second chance with a carefully selected sample instead of chance.

Any skills in communication about these issues quite certainly came from conversations like these with other BeePersons here in the hive, i was all existential wails when I showed up, promise.

And thank you for your kind words and this conversation, Its not the last time I'll read it.

I¬¥m a person with BPD and had a weird crush thing right around the time I got diagnosed and was hospitalized. It was a doomed from the start, then it turned into love, I turned into a BPD monster (he wasn¬¥t perfect either - and also in love with someone else, which I found out half a year later.) Then it  crumbled. I think he felt like he was walking on eggshells and the lies were necessary in his mind to protect me - but a good number of BPD people have built in lie detector (on our good days, of course.) Lying is worse than any triggering honest word. 

 It¬¥s been a few years now since that happened and to this day, I wish for something as honest as that letter to show up in my mailbox.  (I might just steal this letter, and mail it to myself!)

I think, as a person with BPD, it is important to know how the other people in our lives actually feel. We are an oil rig full of emotions and highly flammable. It¬¥s terrifying and some of us, forget that we affect the people around us. For many years, I truly believed I was invisible and my actions had no effect on others. Now, after therapy and alot of learnign, I still have to remind myself that my actions DO affect others. We do alot of facereading/mindreading/misinterpreting - sometimes it feels like our whole life is spent reading other people, trying to find clues to prove or disprove a theory.  All I¬¥m saying is, sure, this letter might trigger that person, but it might also provide some clarity as to how a person can affect another person. 

Written communication is alot easier to deal with than spoken since the person reading the letter can read it at a time when they are in a ""good space."" Letters yay - everything else - nay.

1) If you‚Äôre at university, join societies/clubs. If not, join an evening class/sports club/book club/volunteering group. Just make sure it‚Äôs an activity that you genuinely enjoy- that way you‚Äôll meet people with shared interest.

2) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) groups. There are so many Facebook groups out there for different kinds of people looking to meet like-minded individuals. Start searching and I think you‚Äôll be surprised by how many you can find.

3) There are apps you can use to meet new friends too, some of them better than others. If you‚Äôre a new mum, try [Peanut](https://www.peanut-app.io/). Otherwise, [Serendip](https://serendip.co/) is a good shout for anyone aged around 18-35. They do an extensive personality test to make sure you‚Äôre matched with people with similar values to you.

Not that I'm saying one shouldn't care about things, however the feeling of ""being fake"" (for me) comes from being highly overwhelmed with anxiety. The ""fakeness"" and ""not giving a fuck"" feeling makes for a great mask to cover any anxiety. I have used it as a coping mechanism for a lot of my life. 

The feeling of being stuck in a teenager's mindset hasn't completely gone away for me (I'm 23 now) but what I've found that helps is to ramble or vent my stream of thoughts to my husband. It helps a lot to have another person call out unhealthy thinking patterns in the moment. 

I don't have much advice on the ""feeling like a failure"" part as I ask myself ""Am I a loser"" multiple times a day. My husband reminds me, though, that comparing myself to others will only make me feel worse and to ""stop going on Facebook all the time"".
