First, do not go to a psychologist for the visuals. They will absolutely prescribe you an antipsychotic. All antipsychotics worsen the visuals and make it harder to function. See an eye doctor and they'll determine whether it's a physical problem or not.

Then: take a super dose of b complex vitamins. They will definitely help with mental stability . Then: take a super dose of vitamin D. Then, take a recommended amount of iron and zinc as well as potassium and magnesium. Careful to not overdo the iron or potassium.

I'm going to give you information heatstroke and  Olanzapine from Zyprexa's FDA label:

5.13 

&gt;Body Temperature Regulation
Disruption of the body’s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care
is advised when prescribing olanzapine for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core
body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic
activity, or being subject to dehydration. [See Patient Counseling Information (17.9)].

17.9

&gt;Body Temperature Regulation
 Patients should be advised regarding appropriate care in avoiding overheating and dehydration. Patients should be advised to
 call their doctor right away if they become severely ill and have some or all of these symptoms of dehydration: sweating too much or
 not at all, dry mouth, feeling very hot, feeling thirsty, not able to produce urine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

If you want the whole Olanzapine FDA Lable can be found [here](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/022173lbl.pdf) as a PDF download.

For me it came up over and over again for like a year until I was just so high and manic that one night I just did. I was thinking like, I guess something out there just really wants me to there must be some advantage to it that I'm missing then? Something about atrophy on my skull like my skin was dead and needed to be shaved or something. They muttered something about monks doing it to help them focus not just to symbolize their devotion so I was like yea alright whatever. I woke up the next day and looking in the mirror they were whispering about how weak I was like a lion that lost its mane I'm like weak and pathetic or something for falling for a trick. One of them said the girl doesn't have a mane anyway though and that helped. Doing that really showed me how frantic and stupid these thoughts can get and how impulsive it is to follow them even if they've been around a while, like I didn't feel like it was a spur of the moment thing in the moment cause a lot built up to it but after I did that I don't look at those ideas the same anymore.

The doctor we saw today actually HATES all labels of diagnosis' because it creates too many generalizations when each patient needs an individual treatment for their specific symptoms that negatively affect quality of life.

The problem we have in the USA is the insurance companies seem to adore labels.  With my own condition, CPTSD, there was first argument if it even exists, and now, whether or not the 'C' means ""Complex"" or ""Chronic"".

So...instead of my husband being given the label of ""Schizo-something"" his diagnosis is now ""Psychosis-unspecified/mood disorder-unspecified.""

I think that is the most accurate description of what he is fighting on his bad days without adding as much stigma.  However, even the words ""Psychosis"" and ""Disorder"" can still sound rather damning.

My true thought?  The medical feild needs to tear down the DSM as it currently stands and start with an entirely new, modern, and more accurate manual and process of diagnosing all conditions of the mind.

On account of my label, I was prevented from seeing a neurologist for over 7 years to recieve the treatment I needed for migraines.

 For me, wrapping my head around numbers is a great way to stay grounded.  For example, in business there is a well known concept of ""The Tipping Point"" where if you continue to strive and achieve, you will eventually hit a turn where you become profitable.  Many businesses go the first 5 years of their infancy losing money, but if they set up the right practices and executed them well, they will hit a profitable turn after they have built and established a solid customer base.  

Think of your life as a business, because, essentially that is what it is.  We are thrust into a world of heavy competition and loss at an age where we don't have the experience and understanding to make sense of it all.  That being said, there is a need to try to make the best of every opportunity that comes our way because without that discipline and hard work, we would never know if things could have worked out for the better and would have missed out on those amazing and worthwhile rewards. 

Give yourself some time.  You already started making the right choices when you turned your back on nothingness and chose to live.  In that moment, you stemmed the tide against what seemed a certainty.  You overcame something tremendous.  I can honestly say that I am proud of you for that moment and, even from just this interaction, I can also say I believe in you.

ExtraordinarySuccess,1471668291.0,,,,t2_10q6ie,"What an atrocity! That sends the message to the students that that's all their capable of and that's all anyone thinks of them. Even if school is hard, and maybe some students do need to work at a lower level or with extra assistance, they still need to be reminded that they have potential and are just as capable of working at a higher level as everyone else. When you set the bar low, the results will be low.  Students, whether in your school or a standard public school, need to be challenged and have people believe in them. I think when it comes to certain populations, like addicts, minorities, the impoverished, the disabled, a lot of times people just give up on them and have low expectations. Aside from leaving all of these people ill-equipped to handle things in their future, I think what is worse is the message that is sent, that you are somehow not capable of having success. And it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because people DO notice the lack of challenge. They might not feel a need to complain about it but they notice. And they internalize it and keep working at the level of the bar set low.

anubis--,1471954054.0,,,,t2_10t835,"You're welcome. I'm on 700 mgs of seroquel, topiramate 100 mgs and a couple anxiety meds. I've been on seroquel for a few years. It's the longest antipsychotic I've been on but I've tried other AP's before. I wonder what could cause the difference in how you feel on the same med. Could it be just your body and ways of thinking changing? Maybe it had to do with the med being made by a different manufacturer? 

For me with seroquel I used to get side effects like increased blood pressure and I would also get panic attacks so for a period I did not want this med anymore and felt I couldn't tolerate it. Over time   I've started getting less panicky and found I don't get the increase in blood pressure even from the same old dose. I think mind frame might play a part in how we feel on our meds  through different parts in our lives.

scrimage69,1485821652.0,,,,t2_14xkdi,"&gt;RG: How could a feature that causes psychiatric disease be an evolutionary advantage?

&gt;Kingsley: Several studies suggest that the same genes that have led to rapid increase in cognitive abilities in humans may have also increased our susceptibility to psychiatric disease. This may seem paradoxical, but it clearly applies to other systems in the body. For example, humans are one of the few mammals that have evolved the ability to walk regularly on two legs. This new mode of locomotion frees up our hands for manipulating objects and using tools. However, our recent evolutionary transition to walking upright has also brought with it a high incidence of lower back and knee problems in humans. Similarly, rapid expansion of brain size and cognitive abilities in humans has been a key feature of our evolutionary success. But, the very genomic changes that underlie recent brain changes also may increase our susceptibility to some psychiatric diseases.

&gt;Our study provides a specific example of how this could happen by expanding a particular regulatory DNA sequence inside a key gene controlling neural activity. The same structural change that produces this genomic feature also generates a tandem array that is prone to further variation and may increase the risk of some common psychiatric diseases.

AloTeraz,1532654097.0,,,,t2_1v1vkvn7,"I've had some insane and powerful trips while listening to Alan Watts where everything felt like an electrical circuit and we were all components of it welded on. The trees, houses, the nightsky all connected as one. The oneness I felt was amazing the connection I made with the circuit was because it was a very electrical, emotional and vivid trip.

That said I see people as robots and more so like characters in a sims game. And the robots are the ones who don't realize they're in a game and their character (the ""i"" in which we identify as) is simply an illusion and billions of neurons firing in the brain every second. I've felt at one with everything and had evil psychotic episodes. This also made me appreciate perspectives and how illusory they are, but of course we need them it just means we're free to see life the way we want to and be ourselves. 

 I think of a business man earning money and in societies eyes he's doing absolutely great. He's beating the game, but he also doesn't see the point in it and is severely depressed with his life. To that man I feel like an ayahuasca trip or any psychedelic trip could be highly beneficial. For myself I'm like the opposite. Those trips were a long time ago and I eventually messed my head up with mdma and acid thereafter. But I still see the hierarchical system and society as a game to be played and I do think we need society with its rules to progress as a species of course. But people lose their individuality through brands, cars, fashion, driving the same roads surrounded by man-made structures and cities and they forget the nature side of life. Where we came from.

Theres a great video of a terrence mckenna speech with music and I highly recommend it, it's called terrence mckenna - you matter. Check it out if you have time I think you'll like it. Society is made up of individuals and its great to embrace and enhance that. Its fun to be crazy, for boring people it's crazy to be fun.

I've had plenty of bad trips, first one at 15. Dignosed paranoid schizophrenia, and still didn't learn my lesson. I didn't even believe it honestly. In my mind I didn't have schizophrenia. This went on me eating massive amounts of LSD for probably a decade until I was hospitalized yet again for a 2 month stretch and re-diagnosed with plain ol schizophrenia. Basically LSD activates certain dopamine receptors. If antipsychotic meds are knows to block out certain dopamine or seratonin neurotransmitters, then there is no possible way for the LSD to actually work.

WikiTextBot,1496576979.0,,,,t2_32duad4,"**Apophenia**

Apophenia () is the tendency to attribute meaning to perceived connections or patterns between seemingly unrelated things. Confirmation bias is a variation of apophenia.

The term (German: Apophänie) was coined by psychiatrist Klaus Conrad in his 1958 publication on the beginning stages of schizophrenia. He defined it as ""unmotivated seeing of connections [accompanied by] a specific feeling of abnormal meaningfulness"".

jcshepard,1529872486.0,,,,t2_1n0mu5ej,"I've been through alot lol, as a kid I was mentally, physically, emotionally, and sexually abused. Ive also been the one abusing others in all of those categories at some point in my life, that's just unfortunately the cycle of abuse. Also I abused every drug I could get my hand on, heroin, weed, crack, fentanyl, synthetic weed, adderall, vicodin, acid, mushrooms, mbome, nicotine, and dealt most all of those. Now I'm straight edge. Fat and lazy for years growing up and now I work out and an averagely fit. I've had alot of close friends growing up for almost a decade during all of this. then lost them all, different ways for different reasons. Was borderline suicidal for years, experimented with suicide alot, had 3 close calls, one suicide by cop that didn't happen only cuz the cop drive by my house while I was ducked down with a gun and I came to my goddamn senses with the gun to my chin squeezin the trigger, I felt the hopelessness and sorrow and suffering like some weird vision, felt shit right then so dark, I never thought it was possible to feel, and i chose not to be a part of that. I've been to jail a handful of times, rehab for sexual and drug rehabilitation. Through AA and NA about 5 times. And this all happened before i was even 21. I've had over 20 different jobs since I was 14, now I'm 25. I've been homeless bouncing around friends homes, had a cpl places myself with friends. No matter what I kept going tho. Till I burned myself out working jobs with heavy lifting and pinched my nerves. Like alot of them lol. 

I couldn't feel when I was hungry or thirsty, hot or cold unless it was extremes, had to piss or shit, when I was sick, tired. I couldn't sleep at night and fell asleep driving during the day. I could barely feel anything. Eventually I did acid and meditated to try and get out of my head and figure out why I was so messed up cuz I didn't know then. And then came to the conclusion I was really dead, I died way back when I had that gun to my head and I've been stuck in purgatory till I made things right. Which is crazy, but it did explain why i couldn't feel right? Well everything happens for a reason, and thinking that gave me what I need to try and change everything around and be the best I could, and eventually I felt better and was doing situps and i saw the light when cracked my back all the way down my spine doin em and all my feeling came rushing back all at once. I was so happy I sobbed for bout 20 minutes, didnt even know the person I had been before, i felt like I was 14 again. It wasnt a permanent fix tho, just temporary relief, and slowly, about two hrs later I was back to the way I was, unable to feel. 

Butever since I've been doing physical therapy and getting myself back. But I moved back home after that cuz I couldn't work anymore and have been stuck with my violent schizophrenic sister, and manipulatively abusive mother, who abused me growing up, but now of course after everything I've learned, through treatment programs, AA, life in general I don't let her shit get to, I mean It did at first, it'd get me all sorts of pissed, murderously sometimes, just thinking about how fucked in the head she was, but the more I thought about it, there's really two sides to everything, and nothing is good or bad, bad can come from good and good can come from bad. The duality of good and evil isn't really real, it's just an easier way of thinking about life for those who want to. But while I was trying to ignore everything here, the screaming, and yelling all night, murder threats, sexually fucked up shit from both sister and ma, temptation to use drugs, dude you name a fycked up thing and it happened here, literally the cesspool of lowest animal behavior you can have ever know. Aside from sex trafficking and the actual act of murder or physical abuse. Everyyyyything else. Prostitution, pedophilia. 

Like everything I felt when I out that gun to my head and even worse. I eventually i got the worst of this shit to stop but it took a looong time, 2 years that seemed like 20. My sister tries to control everyone through blackmail and fear, this crazy bitch, I wouldn't let her use my phone charger once and she goes out in the hallway of our apartment and starts telling everyone in the building we live in that I'm a rapist and I raped her growing up and she needs help, crying and shit. like manipulation you've probably never seen other than in fycked up psycho movies. I had to stop going outside around here cuz of people looking at me like they were gonna beat my ass everywhere. To this day those were the worst feels of my life. I could feel how they felt towards me, see it. It was like I was subhuman garbage. But even that was a gift because I learned how to deal with being on the receiving end of that. Everything thrown my way I just saturated myself in and used my inner thoughts and guiding principles to overcome, even if it took months.

Eventually it made me stronger, but, before that I developed PTSD and hypervigilance. I started going to community mental services and got a diagnosis, that helped alot with some things but eventually got into an arguement with my counselor cuz she didn't want me to drink and I felt it was condescending.  I'm not an alcoholic and enjoy a beer once a week but it got under my skin at that time and I was dealing with alot already so I lashed out. But I started developing symptoms of schizophrenia as well, voices, delusions and that. But I got through them all, without medication. Because I never let myself believe something unless I was able to prove it, and that is key. And the more I analyzed my delusions asked why I felt that thing was true, if it even could be, what makes me feel that way. The more I realized about myself and my personality. And I was able to find usually, some little thing that was true, but I had a very misunderstood way of looking at it and that was the delusion. 

And the more I did my physical therapy, the more my PTSD and hypervigilance went away, and also the delusions and voices. But i would've been trapped if i hadn't analyzed so much, and looked everything i could up, and checked the sources of everything I did read of course. And doing that I learned so so much about psychology, and philosophy, and even about biology. Eventually I met a stalemate where nothing happened and I was pretty blank. And I'd get so frustrated doing something, eventually I just kicked something really hard and I felt better, and decided I needed to work out, and i did, and i felt better and got out of that stalemate of numbness and boredom where I couldn't find anything to do. Things started feeling good again and working out opened up more and more things I wanted to do and pursue. Trust me man there is so much to learn. 

Going through all of this though, the only things that kept me alive, kept me from suicide I mean, were knowing that eventually I'd be stronger, and if I ended it I was being weak, and I'm not about that. also, I believe in reincarnation, there's alot of evidence out there of it, even a couple veryyy convincing documentaries, Kids remembering past life families and meeting them and knowing everything about them, And if that's the case then I might as well soak in and learn as much as I can in this life so the next can be better. Those are the only things that kept me going. 

And I know that my life is nothing compared to some people and kids living in third world countries.. so yeah man. Keep your head up and remember it could always be worse for real. Do the best you can but don't be afraid to live cuz suffering is the pressure that turns our coal into diamonds man. It's actually good for ya.

To be honest hospital improved my condition by a lot i used to be suicidal while i was in hospital I ran infront of cars but didn't get hit.

jcshepard,1529872486.0,,,,t2_1n0mu5ej,"Yeah man well, just remember tho, that barely anyone marries their first love, I mean yes it happens and you should try to make it work of course, but almost every single person gets their heart broken you're definitely not alone there man. My first heartbreak I laid in bed for 3 days, and ended up taking my mom's car out before I had my license to the girls house, trying to see if she'd take me back, she didn't lol, and then I get in my car fighting to hold myself together, turn on the radio and hurt by NIN starts playing, so I speed off down dirt roads doing almost 80, suicidally pretty much, and not knowing how to drive, and not caring what happens. I was a really troubled kid already, but still it fuckin suuuuuucked. Got really depressed, met some slut I thought i could fix, stuck with her through cheating n more stupid shit for 3 years. And then gets knocked up by her neighbor the same week I go to rehab. 

Lol like it can really suck man. But that why it's so important to find something You want  that doesn't depend on someone else, like if your goal is to fall in love and you get into a breakup, and that was your deepest goal, you're gonna want to give up.. and its gotta be something that makes you feel important ya know. For me it's going back to college when im done with my physical therapy, and just learning everything I can. I'd like to be really fucking smart lol and maybe form some type of intellectual study circle with people I respect intellectually, and get even smarter lol. seriously I just want to learn everything I can about life. Life freaking amazes me at a very deep level. Like I see everything I learn as another little piece to understanding the intelligence or consciousness that put everything together. Because life is conscious, trees, bacteria, even viruses, right now the accepted model is that evolution is random mutation, but I really don't believe that for one second lol. It's actually simpler and it makes more sense that there is an intelligence, or consciousness, steering evolution. And I want to know how it thinks, because it has to he the smartest thing in all of known existence lol. And everything I learn helps me add a piece to this giant worldview model I have and I really enjoy it. It's kinda like slowly untangling a huge knotted rope lol and someday, even if it's when I'm 50 lol I know I'll get a good view of it and I know I have a unique insight because of all the unique experiences I've had in my life. 

So I started with psychology, and philosophy and i was amazed, I'm gonna learn everything I can about the overview world history and the evolution of humans, and evolution of knowledge, then start chemistry and science and math, and eventually when I'm in my 50's I'd like to have heloed society somehow, through a great book where I compile all I've learned, or an invention or whatever. Just make a name for myself, doesn't have to be big.

Another goal of mine is to be very physically fit, I started working out during physical therapy for pinched nerves and I'm now addicted because I've experienced how it changes you're awareness and expands your consciousness, I'm much more well rounded and I physically feel so much better compared to how I did, I even spend alot of time working out my hands, fingers, toes, and feet, like while I'm watching TV, Cuz all of your muscles are connected and help each other out. plus people respect you more the more fit you are and that makes pretty much everything easier. My true goal is just to be the best human being I can be. Intellectually, Emotionally, and physically. Because it feels so damn good learning and being fit. I truly feel like this can scratch the itch that many people with this disorder feel because it really does feel to me like I'm accomplishing something amazing and making something amazing out of myself slowly but surely, and that gives me so much motivation. Khan academy is a greeeaat app for this too, for the psychology I started watching Carl Jung videos on YouTube, along with Alan watts later, and it helped me understand so much about myself that I never knew. 

 Trust me the smarter and more fit you are the easier it will be to find love, just because people are attracted to successful people, because they want to be happy and successful too. Even if at first you're only doing it to get meet someone, there's nothing wrong with that. It's all healthy for you, working out, learning, relationships. It's all healthy. Just try not to care about meeting too much to where you'll be devastated if it doesn't work out ya know? Cuz you gotta keep yourself happy first. follow what interests you the most in your life and try to see the big picture of your life and where you want to be.

And of course you should probably keep trying to talk to people and meet new people but you know you don't have to admit you have a diagnosis to anyone, that's your business, yours and whoever you want to trust with it. Noone else's. I learned that the hard way with some things in my past I told some people, and someone told me that but at the time I didn't listen because I thought it was best to be honest with everyone, but really, you don't have to be, it's your business. Women don't go around telling people their cup size. And noone goes around telling people they don't trust about things they regret they did when they were really depressed or angry or sad.

But there is a legal test that constrains the treating team so that decisions are not arbitrary and the tribunal gets to decide whether the treating team has got it right. In this case, the test is whether the person can take in the information, weigh the pros and cons, and then communicate the decision appropriately. Comprehend, analyse, communicate. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I read from the tribunal's opinion was that they thought the patient did not have any difficulty understanding (the first part), but their ability to ""use and weigh"" (the second part) was impaired by the illness, which was making for different weights to the pros ad cons. This is usually the case with mental illnesses which don't cause any impairment in comprehension, but do alter reality testing. 

&amp;#x200B;

If (just in relation to your comment above) the tribunal and the VCAT made an essentially circular argument that assumed that mental illness took away capacity, then the court was probably in the right. But that's the crucial step that the ABC article doesn't go into. And I find it hard to assume this, because these are decisions that the tribunal takes every day, and these are the parameters within which doctors are used to framing their arguments.

However, we took her to a neuropsychologist to get her ADHD diagnosis, and he told us that he rarely ever encourages parents to get their children on medication, because that is a deeply individual choice, but in her case he really thinks it would be beneficial, and not doing so could lead to some really nasty depression and anxiety from constantly under performing while working her tail off for things that she knows should be easy. So, I'm feeling encouraged to redouble my efforts to get a second opinion from a doctor who spends their day hip deep in adolescent development, medication, ADHD, and schizophrenia, so I can get the most definitive answer available to me.

Empty_Insight,,,55d921c8-6d5b-11e5-89c2-0eb7787afe7f,Residual Schizophrenia,t2_16v9pr,"So as a simple answer, anxiety + depression + OCD is theoretically about as close as someone could get to understanding schizophrenia without the psychosis. However, psychosis is the hallmark feature of schizophrenia. As such, there's a lot more camraderie among people with other psychotic disorders (bipolar most notably) that just plain isn't there for most mental illnesses.

The line between an irrational thought and a delusion is when it's true. If you can step back and look at it and conclude that it is, in fact, not rational, it's not a delusion. It may be an obsession or the basis of a compulsion in OCD, but delusions to the sufferer are *real*. They're true, and there is absolutely no question of it. They cannot be argued against. They're rigid, and they feed off of other symptoms. Paranoia in the clinical sense- the most popular sign of schizophrenia- is actually a type of delusion. Just being afraid all the time is anxiety. Having a rigid, fixed belief of harm coming to oneself or others if (x) happens is paranoia.

Delusions of note are ""I am a god incarnate"", ""I'm being singled out by Them^TM and my thoughts are being monitored"", ""There's poison in my food"", etc. A lot of the more rigid and bizarre rituals of OCD may mimic schizophrenia, but you at least have the insight to know that they're irrational- which, fat lot of good that does for stopping them, I know.

The difference between mental illness with hypochondria and schizophrenia is the insight- the rule of thumb is ""If you think you have schizophrenia, you almost certainly don't.""",,,1548377560,,,eew0zs7,,t3_ajimpg,,True,t3_ajimpg,/r/schizophrenia/comments/ajimpg/ocd_vs_psychosis/eew0zs7/,,1548377561,11,,True,False,schizophrenia,t5_2r828,,,,,[],dark,text,,,,,False,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",,,,,,,,,,,

grinningailuropoda,,,,,t2_iaikt,"My wife has been using this medium lately and it's done her some good so this is my first post on here. I'm schizophrenic and have been diagnosed for nearly 2 decades. My road started back in the early 2000s and we didn't know much back then (which is funny to think about in and of itself) but I came from a multi-faith belief system and used your very thought to craft a rather robust method for communicating with my subconscious in order to use what control I have over my daily stimulus as well as a slew of CBT methods to exert an influence over the content of my hallucinations.

So, in other words, when you use the standard method of interpreting dreams you run into a flaw from the lack of personally relevant data. You should use the basic concept of asking ""why this?"" To every sensory illusion caused by your mind. Nothing is truly random and that goes for hallucinations  as well. Having an increase in white matter in our brains allows for neurological signals to diffuse into the neurons tertiary to their intended destination or current location. This means that whatever is seen is created through your subconscious stitching together fragmented nodes of information which happen to be adjacent to the parts which are currently being used.

There are quite a few specific examples of methods and academic verification I can give, but I don't want to make this too long and tend to go on tangents.

eyeFOURgotALLredE,,,,,t2_2excj2vx,"I am schizophrenic and even I sometimes have trouble distinguishing my hallucinations between my daydreams. It's also sometimes difficult for me to understand what I'm experiencing mentally. Like I'll know something isn't quite right, but have to focus on all the information my brain is recieving. It can take focus to kinda decide if I'm seeing something in my 'minds eye' or if I'm seeing something visually that is not there. (Both happen to me. They are not the same thing and mean different things as to what symptoms I'm experiencing.) That said THEY CAN BE DIFICULT TO TELL APART! Impossible some days. Some days it's like someone is putting a visual filter on my life. I definitely see things that aren't there. Other times, I'm simply experiencing them in my mind. I don't 'See'  it in the same sense as a physical object in your line of vision. But I'm still experiencing it. Still a thing I can see, still a thing nobody else sees. 

Recently I recall sitting in my living room with my husband talking when suddenly I was seeing the room we were sitting in, empty besides one chair, and black and white, dreary and contrasting. But I saw it at the same time as like 'reality' and there's really know way for me to explain to you how other than the real work was in my visual sight and the weird room was in my minds eye. Well suddenly they reversed, I was sitting in the weird room, seeing it and feeling it and all. And the real world was suddenly in my minds eye. My husband didn't exist anymore besides a voice within my head. I had a MAJOR episode and I think a seizure later that day, because the experience of my visuals and inner visuals swapping like that really messed up my mind for a minute. I remember pointing at a box trying to explain to my husband what was wrong I think he was still real to me and with me until he picked up the box in question and then he was suddenly gone too, in the layer/reality everything else had gone in.


It's so strange to type it all out...the experiences are wild when you're in them and still hard to swallow once they've passed. Even knowing it's all in your head, supposedly,...idk if anything that thought makes it scarier lol.

Sorry this got so long. My main point being that they are very different, yes,  but I can't be mad at people for asking questions, and trying to relate my experiences to their own world.

Murglers,,,,,t2_1t0j4ls6,"Do you have some sort of job where you’re around anything sharp, if you work? Because that could potentially be an excuse. 

If not, something falling on to you could make a cut like that. Maybe something outdoors, some big log or rock. Or you could say you were climbing a tree and you fell. It definitely depends on how deep the scar is wether or not these stories will be believable. I have a massive scar on my knee from a log being dropped on to me while I was carrying it with a group of people. 

If it is deep, you could say you dropped a glass, when on reflex you tried to catch it and hug it to your body, but it broke and cut you. A less probable story, but if the cut is deep then it’s hard to come up with a reasonable excuse. 

If it isn’t deep you can really say anything. If you have a pet, say it scratched you. Say you dropped anything with a scratchy edge. Say you were going for a walk in the woods and you got scratched by something- I have a pretty nasty scar I got recently from scratching myself with bamboo on the ground (non intentionally.) also have an accidental scar from cutting myself with barbed wire that was left in the woods. If you live near woods, you could say you got tripped by barbed wire that was close to your ankle, stumbled, and got cut by it on your thigh. 

Honestly these are all pretty far fetched stories. If it’s really important your mom doesn’t see, you could stick to wearing knee length shorts until it fades enough to be barely noticeable. 

Please be sure you don’t need help. I sympathize with living with my parents and knowing that if they found evidence of my self harm they would be less than helpful.

TheKre8veKurator,,,,,t2_3mez5e9v,"Good questions...

Daydreaming can be done during a “normal” state. I just focus on my inner wake dream and I imagine things happening but there is no visual or auditory disruption - almost like multitasking on one computer where one software is in front and the other software runs in the background. Its quite pleasant. You can try it by “softening” your gaze a little and thinking about something else other than what is immediately in front of you.

Normal dreaming is astral traveling- your “soul” enters into a video game so you are in an alternate dimension with laws that are different from the “normal” dimension- its quite complex. Normal dreams are like movies I cant tell you exactly how it works but I have theories. 

Hallucinations are alternate dimensions merging into your physical senses....its complex but its like a holographic input that seeps in and it is a biological interaction with inner and outer universes- they seem like a new reality and are unique but sometimes other people can relate based on similar spectrums of experience like how people believe in God because of similar experiences of reality. But they are much more advanced than video games or holographic technology. 

For example I saw a group of masked men kidnap and torture my sibling. There were a series of events like objects in the vicinity and movement of objects that were in my reality but that did not occur in the “normal” range real state. There were objects that felt and tasted real but that were disappeared after when I was returned to a normal state.

tedbradly,,,,,t2_evd5e,"&gt;  To say our medication is advanced is a joke, this stuff is the first type of treatment they actually created, imagine the treatments in 100 years. What we have now is literally a chemical lobotomy.

I agree. It will be like cancer treatment when we first started, everyone still died and it was horrific, compared to nowadays where we have about 100% success rates for some types of cancers and are working to bring up the few ones that still certainly kill you. There's a bunch in between. However, what we have now feels like hundreds of years better than every cancer certainly killing you (even though we progressed this far in just decades).

&gt; Sure medication is definitely needed in some cases but in milder cases it’s really not.

I will point out there is some research I've read that states two striking facts, which almost agree with you. You're not far from the truth.

* If treated early (i.e. during the first episode), your chances of recovery are far greater.
* Especially in those treated early, you can take the medications off after recovery with a decent chance of full remission. The motivation for this is that the medical community are not liars or blind, they admit there are severe side effects. For Pete's sake, clozapine can cause death to people using it by reducing white blood cell count. All of them can cause bad mental side effects and energy/sleep issues.

&gt; this stuff is the first type of treatment they actually created 

I want to share with you that this can probably be described as our third wave of treatment if you include the literal lobotomy-days of treatment from the early 1900s. 

* _First__: Electroshock therapy, lobotomy, and insulin coma therapy. (!!)
* __Second__: The antipsychotic class of drugs. These had intense side effects similar to the ones of today. They also higher chances of tardive dyskinesia
* __Third__: atypical antipsychotics. They're about the same as the second wave of treatments, but they have reduced symptoms. A much lower chance of developing tardive dyskinesia.",,,1555622987,,,el7wnh5,False,t3_be8la4,,True,t1_el7inqs,/r/schizophrenia/comments/be8la4/theres_never_enough_sleep/el7wnh5/,,1555622988,1,,True,False,schizophrenia,t5_2r828,,,,,[],,text,,,,,False,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",1555749751.0,,,,,,,,,,

tedbradly,,,,,t2_evd5e,"I was diagnosed myself, and one interesting dilemma he will face and that you should face with him through philosophical discussion is the concept of fault or blame. The common belief repeated here is that none of it is the fault of the schizophrenic, because the awful results are being caused by a disorder out of the control of the person having it. Well, that's true in the sense that there's not a switch a schizophrenic can generally flip to toggle all the symptoms on and off. So it's not his fault in that simplistic sense. 

Let me bring up a few examples where the context of how we use the word ""fault"" seems to mess up if we apply that special meaning to schizophrenics - if we separate the faults from the disorder from faults of choice. For starters, and this is quite a big one, since the disorder blends into who you are quite heavily at first and less so if you improve (there's no guarantees you will), to take away fault from stuff a schizophrenic does just because he's schizophrenic is also to take away fault / glory for anything he does right. Like I said, a person will be changed across the board as his schizophrenia mounts up. So what, is he no longer a free agent with actions worthy of fault or therefore worthy of achievement? You get into this awful gray area where... nothing is their fault... nothing is their achievement. It can really make a schizophrenic feel like he doesn't exist, and it manifests as a struggle between the person with the disorder and the (imaginary) being exerting control over him. One tool to use here is in the beginning, at the very least, say if anything he does with a full good intention or anything he does with a good result that was planned was him doing it. Make that an inarguable invariant. It's half the way there to restoring his sensation of having free will. The other half is controversial, but he will eventually, after given enough months or even years to deal with the horrific symptoms, he can start to more easily say everything that relied on him that went wrong was also his fault. (It just is, but be cautious not to overemphasize faults either - also add but so what? What did you learn from the mistake? Did you pay people back for the harm you caused? Etc.)

I throw in another idea I like. You know how addicts have the 12 step program with the first step admitting they have a problem and need external help? I *really* like concept. I like using it in the battle of restoring concepts of free will  / taking proper blame versus redirecting all blame and having no blame for something you grew into out of your control. Schizophrenia indeed is out of your control, and I'd be damned if I found many positive people who succeeded without asking for external help. Now, if you look at the language here, it does *not* say you are forgiven of all bad things you did - it says *I have a problem (*and implies I'm NOT forgiven of all things). It implies you have to right the wrongs you've done in the past one at a time when you can, and it says you should use your support network / external help as much as possible to stand strong as a person who you can love being, someone who repays debts and does their best.

Unrelated to the whole fault thing above, another good piece of advice is telling him it's going to be a long journey finding answers and that it's all right to completely conclude a curiosity with ""I guess I'll never know"" or ""I don't know now and will find out when I have the time."" This tool will help him since he most likely has plenty of strong delusions that are destroying him inside - they manifest as fearful certainties or urgent uncertainties that need an answer NOW. The best way I can explain it is it's as if your brain fools you into thinking an explanation and an exercise into fairytale writing is needed, and it just cooks one up right there on the spot.

Another tool his brain might be using to automatically make up delusions is forcing the need of things being perfect. His brain will then create the necessary delusions to hold on to the belief of perfection whether it redefines perfection on the fly (normal people do this more often), changes his interpretation of reality to preserve apparent perfection  (schizophrenics do this more often), or whether it plays a game of excuses to justify the imperfection... in some sort of paradoxical language that seems to contradict itself by saying it's perfect, because we're using the frame of reference of all time (or some other silly one) and that measurement is always maximum over all time.

**Die beginnende Schizophrenie. Versuch einer Gestaltanalyse des Wahns,** ***by Klaus Conrad*** **(2003)\[1958\]**. There's no full English translation, but apparently it provides the most impressive description of early schizophrenia.  Conrad coined the term 'apophenia’, which recently featured in *Stranger Things* \- its definition was explained fine but not used correctly in context (as often the case in real life).  Apophenia is a pathologic slant (or progression?) to synchronicity.  Also, Conrad’s Nazi association might raise eyebrows, but as a phenomenological account it is still authoritative.

It is impossible to get a prognosis over the internet.  If he will let you, you could go to his psychiatrist appointment to get some answers.  There is an organization called NAMI in the US that has many resources for family.

Educate yourself. It is great you are here asking questions.

I can tell you a little about me, but we are all different.  I had symptoms of depression and anxiety early on but I was not diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder until I was 39.  That is a late onset, but they do happen. And, I think I slid through with isolating that no one noticed.

It took time and a lot of med changes to help me get stable.  I could not really participate in therapy because I was not thinking clearly at first. Med changes can be hard. I usually feel like I have the flu. I had some wild delusions and it took a long time (over a year) to get them controlled, partially because I thought I was fine.

This is going to be hard to hear, but I was out of work for 10 years, changed careers to something less stressful but pays less and work part-time.  I know someone who told her husband, nervous breakdown time is over and convinced him to go back to work before he was truly ready.  He is very paranoid but is able to do the work. I would be having meltdowns every day.

But, I stayed married, my 2 kids have grown to be wonderful people, I live in a house, have a dog.  I work as a peer mentor 20 hours/week. I have a quiet life but I am content.

And, the huge things is I am rarely troubled by psychotic symptoms. I have anxiety bad, but that is something I have had to deal with since childhood.

Oh and medications can make you really sedated and when you are first on them you can feel like you need to sleep all of the time.  He is not being lazy if that happens.

I pop on the chat room every once in a while but it's been completely dead, I really only go on to talk to you so if you're not on I usually leave pretty quick. 

That's fucking awesome about the weight loss, congrats!!! Losing weight for anyone is hard, but 100x harder for us that are on AP'S and tons of other meds that literally all cause weight GAIN. What has worked for you to lose the weight? For me I think it was a combo of starting work again and actually getting out of the house on a regular basis, getting on better meds and off the bad ones (risperdal), and going for walks in the morning. A fellow SZ I met 2 years ago swears by liquid diets. He literally only drank water, black coffee, V8 juice, chocolate milk, and pedialyte for 3 weeks and lost 30 pounds.

Yeah the whole vape thing is stupid. I think ~10 have died and they ban it, yet cigarettes kill ten's of thousands each year (if not more) and they aren't even close to being banned.

catholicorganistpoet,,,,,t2_4mgghcrt,"I also want to point out that with current research glutamate systems play a huge role in our understanding of schizophrenia. A novel supplement that reduces positive, but mostly negative and cognitive symptoms, is sarcosine, which inhibits the transport of glycine, thereby indirectly increasing glutamate in the NMDA system. I can't remember all the details of the research I read, so I'm sure I'm botching the science, but I remember reading that the glycine mode of action was similar to how ketamine helped depression, except sarcosine, an essential amino acid, works on NMDA in the exact opposite action as ketamine, showing that ketamine's powerful effect on refractory depression is completely incidental to it's psychedelic dissociative, NMDA antagonist action, and is because of its effect on glycine transport (I *think*, it's been a while since I looked into it). Either way, sarcosine over time causes long-term beneficial changes in brain structure, chemistry, and function with some mood and cognitive enhancement occuring immediately, more pronounced long-term improvement of negative symptoms at the 6 week mark, another marked period of stabilization at roughly the 3 month mark, and finally long-lasting improvements at the 6 month mark. There is a lot of promising research into sarcosine's use in treating the notoriously untouchable symptoms of schizophrenia, and it's literally just an amino acid that can be found already in our bodies and in several food sources, so it's not like it's some new pharmaceutical.

I've personally taken it and the effects are noticeable immediately, but can be straight up *miraculous* after the 3 month mark. I cannot even begin to describe the improvement that has been semi-permanent. I am going to start taking it again soon, but I seriously swear by it.

llxlxccxiiororrol0u0,,,,,t2_5yfvhtzm,"I am not a religious person, but I do identify as spiritual. However, I am highly skeptical of all religious and spiritual things, after taking some basic philosophy classes, and breaking my legs after 2 years of spiritual delusions, following experimentation with psychedelic drugs.

I don't want to tell you not to believe in God, because your belief is up to you. When you say that your seltzer exploded the moment you had the thought that God has hidden Himself from you, you believed that that was God confirming your thoughts, and your mom confirmed that it was probably a sign from God. I would strongly encourage you not to assume that something so ordinary is a sign from God. When there is truly a life-changing miracle, I have no problem with you believing that God is watching over you and helping you. For example, when I jumped two or three stories out of a tree (thinking I was Jesus, trying to fly and escape from the ambulance that was gong to take me back to the hospital), I broke both my legs. However, I am walking again today, I am not paralyzed, I am not dead. That is something that I really do believe is an example of God helping me. I feel like God gave me a second chance.

It can be frightening and nauseating to think that commonplace, everyday, ordinary, random things that happen are messages or signs from God, spiritual beings, or angels. If a leaf blows across the path in front of you when you're about to do something--good or bad--does that mean that God or an angel is telling you not to do that thing? No. You can't think stuff like that. I myself began on my spiritual delusional vision quest after being an atheist for years, so I can understand how you want to keep God in your life, how you pray to Him, and how you feel happy when something happens, and it appears to come from God.

Again, I would advise against you thinking that ordinary things are signs. If you can ""pull back"" for a minute, and imagine yourself from an outsider's perspective, like me. You're sitting wherever you're sitting in your house, and thinking about God and your relationship with him. Suddenly, the seltzer explodes. You have this ""aha"" moment and say, ""Oh, God was giving me a sign!"" But to the outsider, it's nothing more than you sitting there and thinking, and seeing a water bottle exploding. The two things just happened to occur at the same time. It's not like the clouds are opening up and there is a powerful light from the sky that is speaking to you and telling you to inscribe 10 commandments onto two stone tablets. It's not like you're parting the waves of the ocean so that your enslaved brethren can flee Egypt. I don't mean to make fun of you or your experience, I just mean to say that you should only believe that God is helping you when the event is highly significant. For example, the fact that I am walking today after breaking both my legs.

I also used to believe, similarly, that ""psychedelic alien angels"" were speaking in my own mind's internal monologue. I would hear a word or phrase, depending on what I was thinking, feeling, or intending to do. I thought that otherworldly beings were communicating to me and giving me advice. I would hear these thoughts and phrases, and they would sometimes surprise me, because they did not appear to come from my own free-willed, logical progression of thoughts, from A to B to C. But I know this is not the case any more. I know that every time this happens, it's just me saying these things. I wonder whether these phrases and words that I hear have more to do with my ""unconscious"" mind or intuition or instinct. But it is certainly not aliens or angels that are constantly speaking to me.

Please do speak with a professional about these things. It is not healthy to walk around, thinking that the government or some group of people is implanting voices, words, or ideas in your mind in order to torture you. I'm here to tell you that that is not true, that it's just your own voice, but these things can get very complicated. It might help if you read about my experience, and see if it helps at all.

raul824,,,,,t2_o5ep6,"I went in to full psychosis twice. And was in home for 8 months but didn't stopped the pills. First time it was without any external reason.

Then after 8 months all symptoms were gone and stopped taking medicine. Started working from office and they send me on business trip to Oregon US. Weed was legal there so i smoked a lot and then i came back to my country and started smoking weed.

Then the voices started again so i went to same psychiatrist who helped me first time. I didn't told him that i was smoking weed and he gave me meds. I started meds but didn't stopped the weed. This time the psychosis was much worse than what I mentioned in the 1st comment. This time instead of a lady i can hear whole crowd of people marching and shouting on the roads to come and kill me.  

My mother knew about weed and forced me not to smoke after 5-10 days i was so addicted  to weed that i can't focus on anything my brain was overclocked to its limit that it was simultaneously switching to two opposing thoughts. Anxiety reached its peak. I was crying in fron of my parents to just give me one drag of weed.

My mother called the doctor and told him about weed. And he gave me the most powerful pill ever in all of my medication (rivotril) which calmed my mind but it was so strong that focusing on anything became so hard. Going out of house was a nightmare 

Then again 6 months of depression, meds, no will to live, no interest in anything.  
Then after 6 months i went to doctor again with my mother. Mother told the doctor to tell me how weed can affect and doctor told me if i took a drag ever again it will start again.

So now after three years doctor has stopped meds and told me to take if i feel any symptoms again.   


Currently in a very good place and very happy. Working in Sydney. I am the geek of office and even higher management has noticed my work and did some fantastic job in company performance reporting.

I was supposed to shower but woke up too late. Its been a few days. I need to be fairly cleanly for work for contamination reasons but oh well. Could've been worse. So I just rolled outta bed and went to work. I wanted to leave early and I asked to do so. Luckily my (menial) job is very flexable.

I figured I should work more in case I get sectioned this weekend. My IOP has been wanting to send me to the inpatient unit.

Then I had to switch to a new psychiatrist, who felt that my dosage was too low despite it managing my symptoms quite well.  The therapeutic dose of Abilify, when used to treat schizophrenia, is 10-15 mg.  My new psychiatrist began increasing my Abilify dosage with that goal in mind, but we only got up to 5 mg per day before it caused me to sleep literally 20-22 hours a day, every single day.

So she took me off Abilify and switched me to something else.  With the antipsychotic I'm on now, the dosage I take is within the normal prescribed dose for a person with sz.

So your daughter has visited two psychiatrists, but is she seeing a particular psychiatrist on a long term basis?  She (and you) will need to ask her treating psychiatrist about supporting her desire of dose reduction.  If her treating psychiatrist does not believe this is a healthy plan for your daughter, then you're both out of luck.  Or, you could switch to a new psychiatrist, but telling said new psychiatrist, ""Hey, we're switching to you because the last one refused to let us reduce the medication dose"" probably won't be well received.  From my experience, psychiatrists want their patients to have been seeing them for awhile, be taking their medication exactly as prescribed for the duration of that time, and be stable before they consider letting schizophrenia patients reduce their medication dose.

In his view the major pathology of the mind was the *ego*, from which springs the ‘three enemies of the people: hegemony, monogamy and monotony’.

mark-cobb,,,,,,"Perhaps later you could go into the meds you take and how they effect you in more detail so I can see better where your at. I said before, finding the right meds is key but in order to get better you need to find someone to talk out your problems with and to begin to take time to meditate. Everyone is different so different things will help different people but I believe these 3 things are essential for good mental health for most people. We can get into the meds later so let's start with talking out your problems with someone, the ones you can't help with medication completely. I was very lucky in this area. Although I couldn't find the right DR. to do psychotherapy with me, I did have my Mom to talk to and although she wasn't a Dr., she read on the subject religiously and knew how to apply that knowledge to me. She really missed her calling. She was the one that helped me with my delusions and my paranoia. From a young age she tuaght me that reading could be fun so it was no problem reading books on this subject and others related in order to help myself. It wasn't coming from the Dr. so I had to find answers for myself. Together with what my Mom learned and I learned from books we found answers sometimes in unexpected places like books on Eastern Metaphysics, self help books, books on meditation, drugs. I've found knowledge of the chakras and meditation to be invaluable to dealing with life's complications. Meditation helps you find the center. It helps a person to see the world a bit more subjectively and that makes life more bearable. It's difficult at first but if you stick with it I think you'll find yourself thinking much clearer. In the West we look for quick results but remember people from the East who meditate do so for years and years. You must be patient. Meditation is simple but it's not easy, especially if you have a hard time with racing thoughts as many do. People think that in order to meditate you have to get rid of your thoughts and they give up before they even start. Meditation about sitting. That's all. There is no goal. Your brain is like a muscle that's working when your asleep as well as when your awake and that is too strenous. It needs rest and during meditation is the only way it can do that. The thoughts will still come but as time goes on you'll find out that not all thoughts deserve to be given a lot of attention to. Then you begin deciding what your give time thinking about not only while your meditating but also while your going about your day. At first it will seem as though you can't control your thoughts and for the most part that's true but you can control what thoughts you dwell on. Most of the time we don't even realize when we are making ourselves miserable because we're continually dwelling on unesessary shit. Thoughts that we are allowing to ruin our whole day or even ruin years of our lives. Time wasted on worrying about things we can't control. And most of all dealing with fear. How you coupe with fear is how your gonna deal with symptoms like paranoid delusions. I learned about this while reading a book and listening to my Mom talk about the ego. People are controlled by fear more than anything and no one more than someone predisposed to paranoid delusions. Fear can take hold of a person and make like unbearable. Fear can make you stop trusting others . As Yoda said, fear leads to hate, hate leads to anger and anger leads to suffering. So as to not suffer you have to stop dwelling on the things you fear. Mediatation will help you to be able to be of a presence of mind to catch yourself thinking fearful thougths or negative thoughts and stop them in thier tracks by replacing them with positive ones. I know it's a new age clique but it helps. Positive thinking can help you dig yourself out of the pit of dispair. I was way paranoid about the government until I learned it was a trick of that dark part of the ego. It was too egostistical to believe that of all of the millions of people, why would they pick me to spy on? What made me so special? But see, I couldn't see that. Then I learned that it's through fear that the people in charge can more easily manipulate the masses. The ego wants you to think that there are enemies all around. Everyone has that. The truth is the only real enemy we have is ourselves. Having fear makes us mistrust people. Trusting people is something that I've struggled with for a long time. I still do. I have realized that there are two kinds of fear. Rational fear and irrational fear and mine has been the later. You have to trust in the universe. The universe wants you happy and healthy. It wouldn't be the same place without you. Fear sometimes needs a light to be shown upon it in order for you to be free of it. Knowledge helps and so will finding something or someone to love. My Mother's love, patience and understanding and the birth of my son fortunately was my light. Meditation can be another. Try it. Not just once or twice and no music. Silence is a great healer. Maybe next time we can talk more about meds.

RunePoul,1335992012.0,,,,t2_7maib,"The context for the quote is that Terence is visiting a library when he notices a book about schizophrenia and proceeds to read it. He then encounters the quote and realizes that it perfectly fits his own definition of the most mentally healthy person he can think of, hence the “That’s it!” exclamation. You can hear him tell the story himself in the first YouTube link.

The second link is McKenna talking about how he handled actually experiencing schizophrenia in his younger years. One of the points he makes is that what got him through it was that he didn’t even believe in his own thoughts to begin with, so that kept him from acting out on the hallucinations when they set in.

As I’m writing this, I’m thinking of another thing he said in the beginning of one of his many lectures: 

&gt; “The point is to give the speech so that everyone hears something different.”

When I heard him say that, I certainly heard something different (all the time), and I’m sure some of you guys reading this will recognize that wonderful (or terrifying) feeling of some different meaning behind everything that’s actually being said.

I remember reading this general advice from a homeless guy on reddit (being sure it was written specifically for me, lol) which helped me through some hard times:

uyfgfhgfhgfhgfhgfhgf,1522107574.0,,,,t2_13jc39qo,"I can vouch for the horror element in night terrors. I know this experience from when I was around 20 or 21. I had been suffering panic attacks and ended up in hospital basically believing I was just about to die. When I was discharged I had still not really come to terms with the stress and panic factor of it all and it was ruling me completely. During the next two weeks I started having these bizarre dreams where I was paralyzed and awake but hallucinating at the same time. The physical experiences in the hallucination were real to me and the scenarios looked exactly like real life- absolutely different to dreaming. I was having them every time I fell asleep for around two weeks. It was really really terrifying because I had never read about the condition before and thought it was something unique to me.

What I know now is that for me these experiences are stress related and happen when I am under a high amount of pressure. I was in hospital recently and it started again but just a single experience. It's hard to explain how sinister the hallucinations tend to be to people because usually people go, ""Oh yeah you had a bad dream...so what?"" But those others who have experienced them understand a bit more. 

For me the underlying factor was stress and panic so maybe you could explore if this might be the case for you and try to combat it with regular exercise- this is what worked for me.

I don’t doubt that some people struggle all the time, but I hate that the schizophrenic mind is being made to look PURELY scary and disgusting in a sensational, outlandish way.


Don’t some people with schizophrenia wonder what they should watch on Netflix, sometimes?Don’t they think about what they’ll have for dinner, or their friend’s upcoming birthday? Aren’t facets of their existence inherently mundane and simple, just like everyone else’s, as opposed to being a gore fetishist’s gratuitous impression of what mental turmoil looks like?

BaltouMeunier,1518781612.0,,,,t2_qdnxont,"i've had a single voice manipulate me into believing that people could hear my thoughts by passing for other people responding to my thoughts aswell as a myriad of other ""delusions"", like making me believe all humans hear voices,

(my own idea) or that there is a hive mind controlling all humans unconsciously and people who hear voices are the ones who broke out of it, and the voice is the hive mind trying to gain back control on me

the voice i hear doesnt know anything about me, at first i thought it was saying gay-ish things to me to try and make me believe im gay or something, then i realized it thought i was a woman...it reads my thoughts and responds to them, making sentences and a lot of sense when it talks, but its just manipulative and ""evil"", it doesnt want me to think anymore so that it becomes my thoughts and I will follow its ""commands"" mindlessly (which is a delusion the voice has)

I also noticed something, most of the problems from schizophrenia are actually delusions, for example: disorganized thoughts (its the belief and acceptance that you cannot organise your thoughts that triggers unconscious distractions and loss of thought), same goes for other problems, theyre all in our minds, created by it!!! the cure to these problems is to gain insight to as why, and not accept it, think logically and rationally/

One of my latest problems is thought insertion, the belief that the voice can put thoughts in my head/ or that I can hear its thoughts like it can hear mine.the voice continuously tries to convince me it can put thoughts in my head, and to make me believe it, it speaks a rhyme to my thought very silently whilst in the middle of a thought sentence and my thought sentence will be changed from (example): I love blinis &gt; I love BIKINIS

and make me pass for a motherfucker in front of god (even though i tried to explain the voice that god knows what it is doing (passing for my thoughts to make me look bad) it keeps on doing it on whatever hopes it has)

whats it's doing is trying to make me think i can hear its thoughts by speaking silently, thus introducing words into my sentences, in the hopes that i forge the belief that i can hear its thoughts so that I actually have extra hallucinations of its thoughts, I hallucinated its thoughts once or twice but i quicly rationalized it.

another one is the voice's ability to read my ""back thoughts"", or simply put, the thoughts and feelings that i have that are not (yet) worded out in my mind, at first it couldnt read those thoughts, but I described to myself what a ""back thought"" was and the voice heard about it, and since I was in full psychosis the voice said to me one time: ""EHHHH!!! you know you're saying a lot of things while you speak!!!!"" (referring to my background thoughts), and the moment it said that it lead me to believe that it could read these background thoughts... And the simple belief that i could read my background thoughts made it possible for the hallucination (voice) to respond/react to these thoughts and now its permanent, 've been trying to stop believing that it can read these back thoughts but whenever i think about something i believe the voice can hear it ( as i write this i am now having the belief that it cant hear these back thoughts, and my technique works)

same goes for the voice seeing my visual thoughts, it led me to believe it can see them, but its just me changing the hallucination behavior (it reacting to my visual thoughts) just by believing it can see my thoughts.

it also tries to stop me from understanding things and rationalizing by distracting me with noise and loud sentences.

now I know that the way it behaves is the consious and unconsious beliefs of it's behaviour that build it's personality and games

All the antipsychotics have some kind of side effects just have to find something that she can tolerate AND function on.  (everyone reacts differently to them because we are all different)

Get her back on meds because psychosis gets worse over time and it causes brain damage.   OHHHH and there is USUALLY  depression right after psychosis so if she starts meds again she might feel depressed.

CBT? Come up with a mantra that works for you, that matters to you. Don't pick on of these, but here's an idea of something to repeat to yourself.  
  
""They don't even matter""  
""Nope, I'm doing fine""  
""Go to the store, get eggs and ham""  
""Nope, I control my thoughts.""  
""Wait for the 123 bus/train.""  
""Focused and straight.""

Concrete Reasons to trust that you’re not pregnant: 
You have an IUD
Your boyfriend uses condoms

This is enough to reasonably believe you’re not pregnant. 

Possible explanations for the other symptoms is your medicine is messing with your hormones slightly which is why you saw the blood. 

The nausea and hot flashes could mean you’re getting sick. 

I think you should assume you’re not pregnant and take the test to cement that fact.

The two major things that changed this problem for me were 


Accepting the idea they were trying to kill or otherwise harm me/manipupate/sabatogue. Complete surrender. I couldn't stand how I was hurting people I cared about and I couldn't stand the constant overwhelming experience of existing. Letting them do what they would like just to do /something/ ended up worth it to me 


The second was recognizing I didn't have to stick with a provider. At any moment for any reason I could just say, hey, can I see a different doc? My insurance only covered psych in house so I eventually changed locations, and now literally drive 250mi to get my psych check ups (different therapist, and I moved out of state) because I found someone I don't believe could lie to me without me noticing. It took me a long time to find someone that /worked/ for me, but it also took me putting myself into uncomfortable situations and giving people, even if I didn't like them, a chance. Like I would like people to give me a chance. Because they are humans. And a majority I have found to be very inconsiderate, self absorbed, unintelligent humans, and that's from the perspective of pretty shitty me too, so ya know they sucked.

Yes, suffering can be a source of inspiration. But it's far from the only source and if your only source of inspiration is suffering nobody will bother with your creative output anyway. Nobody turns to art to see the artist's suffering.

It just looks like that for people who are suffering when they see similar topics portrayed in art like this. They don't see the distance the artist has had to the suffering portrayed.

And, seeing as this was your first post on the subreddit, I assumed you hadn't visited it before, which is why I made the assumption that you may not be educated on mental health. 

See  - how I pieced it together is that you saw the video randomly visiting schizophrenia for the first time and didnt see my subscriber count. I don't have an immense amount of subs, yeah, but I legitimately have a community that surrounds my videos. They need to be made aware of my personal life, as that's the whole point of my channel. 

I appreciate your advice, but I don't feel I need a edit: therapist. I feel the support of my parents plus my psychiatrists and my social worker is more tha enough. Plus - if you had watched the video (if you did watch it, sorry, I just find it confusing if you did) you'd know that I haden't been taking benzos for nearly long enough a time to have severe withdrawals. I don't think adding a therapist to my schedule is necessary given the circumstances of the whole thing.

I don't believe I have ever had a tactile hallucination but the worst case of schizophrenia I have ever seen involved them. I was in a mental hospital with a man who had severely disorganized thoughts and speech. He would think I was Jesus and apologize for killing me. Doesn't sound so bad so far right? He was convinced that he had killed Jesus and it was the worst possible sin and God was punishing him for it. He would *scream* ""LOCUSTS, THEY'RE COMING OUT MY EYES, MAKE IT STOP, I'M SORRY."" and ""HELP! I'M ON FIRE, PUT IT OUT, PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME."" Then he would scream in agony like he was really on fire.

This was a shitty hospital and I sometimes had to advocate to get the charge nurse to do anything for him. Finally they would give him a 5 and 2 shot (5 mg Haldol and 2 mg Ativan.) Sometimes they would even give him a 10 and 4 shot. That would calm him down for a few hours.

I've tried like 20 meds now and I've finally found a few that work for me. Invega, Rexulti, Klonopin and Prazosin. They have few side effects.

Capgras delusion is a psychiatric disorder in which a person holds a delusion that a friend, spouse, parent, or other close family member (or pet) has been replaced by an identical impostor. The Capgras delusion is classified as a delusional misidentification syndrome, a class of delusional beliefs that involves the misidentification of people, places, or objects. It can occur in acute, transient, or chronic forms. Cases in which patients hold the belief that time has been ""warped"" or ""substituted"" have also been reported.The delusion most commonly occurs in individuals diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, but has also been seen in brain injury, dementia with Lewy bodies, and other dementia.

rubberdickydude,1537331246.0,,,,t2_28q0jjz9,"I was at this place called ACS where I met this man named Chris. I was there for treatment while this guy lived on the top floor in an Appartment. I was there for drug use and scitzophrenia. I was paranoid cops where after me and that people could hear my thoughts. So I thought this man named Chris was a cop so we played a basketball game of pig. Earlier in my life I sayw a vision of Blessed Mother Mary on top of our milking barn. While I was playing with him I kept saying in my head.. let me go I saw Mary. I took three outside 3 pointers and every time time I shot I thought the thought. If I make this shot I saw a vision of Mary. After I missed all three shots he turned to me and asked.. do you know Mother Teresa? At this point I was like okay.. that was weird. We proceeded to play the game and later he wanted me to listen to these three cds. This is what the tree were named. The book of Enoch, Something like ‘Christmas music’, and misty Edwards. While we were playing basketball he had on a black vest. He went into his room and came back out a purple zipper pull tab. While I slept I listened the the Enoch, Christmas music instrumentals, and the first song of the misty Edwards cd. I then gave the cd and CD player back to him. I then went into his room and he wanted me to read this single page from revelation. I then read one line from the middle of the paper which read he who holds the world and handed it back to him. I then left the room and went on with my day. I later went outside to smoke a cigarette and I sat next to him and without me paying any attention he elbowed my elbow. I then later went to an AA meeting with this girl named summer whiting. I also thought she was a cop so I would talk to her and be nice to her. I noticed she was carrying a purple gateraide. She sat by me and at the end of the meeting we were about to hold  hands and say the Lord’s Prayer and summer put her head down and said I’m sorry. She then held my hand until the prayer was over and while we were saying the prayer I felt something deep within. Like something was eating at my insides. I then later saw Chris and summer sitting outside together where it looked like Chris was avoiding her and she was smiling and talked to him. My time was up at ASC and I got moved to the Arbor halfway house. She followed me to Arbor and wrote me a letter thanking me for being there for her and what not. I She asked me if I would sit with her while she smoked a cigarette. I said yes as I quit smoking and chewing a couple weeks earlier. All this happened in Oct, Nov, and Dec of 2017. She was then listening to a song by Griz where she was singing along and said I’m the reaper. Another time I was sitting at the table eating my ramen noodles and the halfway house staff came over to me and looked at me for a moment and summer looked at him and said “hey don’t talk to him like that” or hey don’t be mean to him” and Paul had a look on his face like wtf. After I heard this I completely avoided her and wouldn’t talk to her until one night she got a dui and was crying and asked if I would talk to her. Before this she played that one YouTube video of will ferrel video of the song don’t fear the reaper while will Ferrell says I need more cowbell. While at ACS we used to eat these sour mike and ikes. Then at Arbor she gave me another box. About 6 months before this I was walking to my parents house on the highway and I was walking in the line in the middle kinda hoping to get hit. By the grace of of God I almost got hit a semi and the semi almost hit the ditch. Jesus had more planned for me. I was then mopping the floor and I saw summer walk the vinyl line. I later was in the kitchen and I set my cup down on the table and I noticed that the way my cup looked by all the other ones I looked like a Stella consolation. Later on in the day I went to the kitchen and I saw summer by the island with cups and a blue power aide as the Stella star. And as soon as I saw it she walked away. I was then sitting in the living watching tv when summer came out of her room and I thought I heard something almost like I heard her thought. She asked me if she could use my calling card because the phone wouldn’t go long distance. I went and grabbed my card and went I handed it to her she touched me and I never heard it again. She then tried going around halfway house giving stuff to people to try and touch them is what I think. Flashback to before she got this dui. I was sitting in the living room on the chair watching tv again and she asked people if they wanted to go to the Strawberry a bar in town. She asked two people and either I never heard them say anything or they never said anything and just follows her. She then sat on the arm rest of the chair and put her arm around me and said let’s go to the Strawberry. I said no and would barely talk to her. She said I want to kiss you. If I remember right still didn’t say anything. Maybe said no about a couple times. She then gave up and the three left. The guy that was sitting in the chair next to me when over to the calendar hanging on the wall and started lightly banging his head on it in front of me. Now this is where it gets crazy. About a week or two before this I was laying in bed. And I thought do you want to lick me amd then I vfelt someting like touch my neck and I heard in her voice like a licking noise and a haha. I then had the thought.. what if I kill you? I then heard a voice in that sounded like hers say.. pewwwww boom. I then went to bed. It was either that night or a a few nights later I was sound asleep and I woke up to what felt like someone or something was holding my head to the side to where I couldn’t move and I felt something bite my neck. I then became angry and several moments later I kept thinking I’m gonna kill you. I then did not sleep with my lamp or room light off until my Roomate came/ she left. While I was writing this in the tractor tonight I had one AirPod in and as soon as I wrote the name Chris I heard like a whip noise and then the first time I wrote summer whiting I also heard a whipping noise. And I’m not sure but I felt like Jesus was informing me last night that Chris has the mark. I felt like a twitch or something in the back of my left thigh and I felt like Jesus told me that that is where he put his mark. I have been going through schizophrenia for almost a year now. I dot hear voices but sometimes thoughts just pop into my head. I told Jesus and Mary and Jesus’s father that if I hear things I want to her their voices. I believe when i get thoughts put into my head it is one of them 3. Now this is as truthfully as I can remember and put it. Remember to put Jesus in your heart. Now you guys can think what you want.

Thank you for sharing your experience! 

I have a thirst for knowledge too and love DMT very much. Despite loving DMT, I have had some scary experiences on it and experienced dissociation afterwards. I find it very hard to sleep afterwards. 

I agree that people with schizophrenia should be cautious around this substance, but truthfully I do think that DMT could help people who suffer from severe depression or are addicted to other substances.

You might call them and find out if they have advice for how to get help for your friend :[https://www.semel.ucla.edu/psychosis/contact](https://www.semel.ucla.edu/psychosis/contact)  In California the involuntary hospitalization process is called 5150. Usually someone gets taken to an ER where a social worker evaluates them and determines whether they are a danger (to themselves or others) or gravely disabled. The person can be sent to a psychiatric hospital for up to 3 days, when a determination is made whether they should be kept longer. Hospitalization can be very traumatic and should be viewed as a last resort to save someone's life. It sounds like your friend desperately needs medication to help him function. The trick will be someone getting him to an ER. The police should do this but they don't want to get involved because sometimes an officer has to stay with the person for hours at the hospital. If he is doing the things you mentioned the police have to get involved before someone gets hurt. Call and speak to a watch commander, or ask if they have a mental health crisis intervention team. Many departments have these special units now because mental illness is so rampant. 

Probably not much you can do from afar if you don't know where he is or what he is doing. His mother may also have paranoia or she wouldn't go along with his delusions so readily. They need a social worker to step in and help both of them.

Seems simple.  Schizophrenics see God, just as a way to say it.  Different from non-schizos and if you have it, then you know you get constant coincidence.  Others see that, whooo, scary.

Specially in times gone by when humans didn't know what they know now, science-wise, so people were more credible, believe all kinds of shit.

Now I'm just borderline self-sufficient, sometimes (a lot of the time) the dishes don't get done and I know I haven't cleaned the shower in probably a year and I don't cook, I just eat premade stuff or fast food and drink lots of milk with heavy cream for the calories, eat lots of nuts for the fats, drive every day...where am I going with this...I have two cats to care for and they're doing great.

Thing is, these meds wreak havoc on your memory and can be addictive and make anxiety worse in the long run. I had little problems getting off them, in fact when I quit I found my anxiety improved significantly to the point of being able to drive again; I couldn't drive while on them because I was too anxious about crashing.

These sorts of drugs are only supposed to be taken for a couple weeks at a time, and for good reason. I still take them from time to time when I absolutely need to sleep. I have enough left over from when I was prescribed them that I could probably kill or at least knock out a horse. 

I attribute my very easy withdrawal to this supplement I take, magnesium glycinate. It helps with anxiety and constipation and apparently people at r/stackadvice also says it helps with benzo withdrawal but I didn't know that until way after the fact so I guess I got lucky. 

My mom said I looked ""drugged"" while on them and for me that was the final straw. I was tired of living in a haze. So I quit them, for the most part.

You will hear different people have positive and negative experiences with each drug. Risperdal made me gain weight and worsened my symptoms, while my friend who takes it loves it. My friend who takes abilify experiences zero side effects, others can’t tolerate it.

Personally I experienced zero side effects from latuda. Some people gain weight from meds, some lost weight, etc. I could go on but you get my point, 

You can’t rely on the internet to tell you how a drug will make you feel. You just have to try the drug and see for yourself. The process can be long, frustrating, annoying, discouraging, but you can never predict how it will effect you based on anecdotes from others. And who knows, you might get lucky like some of my friends did and find a perfect fit on your next try!

All with no ""hallucinations"" mind you, just simply thoughts and ideas in my head.

So for me personally, I would describe psychosis as ""being stuck and immersed in a daydream"". I didn't know what daydreams were at the time, but thats what the sensation felt like.

Aphantinaut,,,,,t2_3lp6ccxf,"Well, with aphantasia I literally cannot visualize things. Some people would say its akin to having no inagination. For instance, i cant make myself happy by recalling a memory of me being happy. All I know is a set of times thay i was happy. That thought has no emotional impact on me. A person whi couod visualize going to no visualziation might describe as living like a zombie with no emotions.

The interesting thing to me about aphantasia vs schizophrenia lies with hallucinations. Everyone agrees that hallucinations ""donty exist"". If they dont exist, it means that they are a product of imagination. 

Now, have you ever heard of ADHD? Someone described it as ""living without pop-up blocker"". So clearly, its possible for the human mind to ""hi-jack"" consesus reality and instead focus on ""imagination"".

So, whats the difference between ADHD and uncontrollable ""hallucinations""?? To me it seems to be in how the subject interprets the stimuli.

Now imagine, there are people out there with phobias of sunflowers. Literally, the image of a sunflower will negativelt effect their mental health. Would it not be possible then to develop a fear of your vivid imagination that you cant seem to control? Could this fead be fueled by a complete misunderstanding of what it means to be ""schizophrenic"".

And furthermore, if hallucinations truely are just the product of an overactive imagination, how does supressing the ability to imagine through medication affect the subject? Being an aphantasiac realizng that people can ""visualize and re-live"" memories, I have seen from the outside how important focusing and visualzing the conversation is to the overall human socialization experience.

My mind was having its stream of thoughts transformed into jumping to arbitrary memories from childhood to recent friends to random shit I saw a stranger do any amount of time in the past from recent to way back when, it was accompanied by a complete flush of my memory (I'd basically blank out and blip back into existence) plus a hallucinated ""photographic memory"" that would flash (I don't have photographic memory, so this is new and uncontrollable). There was also a problem where my schizophrenic voices + train of thought loss of control + flashing memories would focus on shit that exclusively annoyed me - things like sexualizing animals and children (something I had never done and something that repulsed me as it happened), thinking poorly about family/friends (like they have bad intentions), my own lack of worth, etc. Each of these categories was foreign to me, and it still is thank God.

The daydreams can be triggered and how it happens and appears is different from person to person. 

What is tour definition of hallucination vs imagination? Are you aware that its quite possible to imagine and see things in actual literal ""real life"" with your minds eye? Its normal and its jot a hallucination. Its a capability of the human mind.

Once again, I apologize if I come off as igngnorant to your plight. Ive lived for 29 years, and i had no idea daydreams or ""seeing with your minds eye"" was even possible until last week.",,,1555610971,,,el7d5u2,False,t3_beogob,,True,t1_el7cgqi,/r/schizophrenia/comments/beogob/some_of_what_i_see_and_hear_especially_the_man/el7d5u2/,,1555610975,1,,True,False,schizophrenia,t5_2r828,,,,,[],,text,,,,,False,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",1555740041.0,,,,,,,,,,

Angelo_Maligno,,,,,t2_y873wbu,I sometimes get angry at people out of nowhere. It can be hard to let go. When you're on your own just try some zen meditation. Close your eyes and practice letting go of your thoughts and feelings. This has helped a lot with intrusive thoughts and feelings for me. It's the difference between feeling rage for a couple minutes and just feeling anger for like 10 seconds. Very useful.

When I’m having a psychotic episode (delusions, hallucinations, etc) it’s best not to argue with what is my reality because it’s very real to me. Acknowledging my thoughts/feelings would be nice and double checking to make sure I’ve taken my medications or slept and am eating.

TheAbominableShowman,,,,,t2_11mi6gdo,"That was a problem in the past. But there’s one girl in particular that keeps looking at me. And the other day I thought about how I would be fine if I talked to her and things didn’t work out. I’d still get up and go to work every day, stay clean and wouldn’t fall into a pit of self-loathing like I used to.

The way women perceive me is complicated. I know they like me and I know they find me attractive. But I also have a lot of things going on which could be legitimate deal breakers. I lost a bunch of weight and my skin is fucked up, I have a slightly offcolored front tooth, obviously the mental health issues and I still live with my parents because I’m just starting to get my life back on track. None of which is this girl knows because she’s only seen me clothed and I haven’t told her anything personal. I mean I’ll have the money to fix all of these things by the end of the year if I keep working (getting the tooth fixed in 2 weeks), but I would still understand if she didn’t like me after finding out these things (she is quite attractive and could find a guy without these issues probably pretty easily)

There’s also that I originally went insane because of something an npd girl did, so I think the thought of getting close to someone else is a trigger. The delusions went both ways though. Sometimes they were saying that she wouldn’t care about all those things and that she likes me and others they were saying she would care and will reject me. Either way, I’m going to talk to her and ask her out before the end of the semester. I guess the delusions could just be triggered by the anxiety due to the bad experiences from the past.

The creepiness thing is still something I struggle with. I think it’s because I was an odd kid and I remembered a girl told me one of my friends girlfriends said I was creepy. But she also turned out to be a pretty bad liar that would try to start shit between people so who knows. I know that I couldn’t function properly around girls for a long time, I think because of my relationship with my mother. Once I felt comfortable I would be fine around them, but before that I would just sort of be really quiet and act awkward around them. That’s gotten a lot better, to the point that I can be relaxed upon meeting one, but I guess I still have that nagging doubt sometimes that I’m being creepy but I was able to dismiss that feeling almost instantly every time it came up because I know it’s not true now.

RedditSeemsScary,,,,,t2_16xxbw,"Good.  Lots of bumps,  but good. 

Symptoms (the hard part)-&gt; I still experience hallucinations in all five senses,  some simple such as smells,  textures, or music that is not real,  and others complicated,  such as people who have interacted with me for the better part of 15 years, but aren't real. I get paranoid sometimes. I get anxious.  I dream with a vividness that makes me question weather in awake sometime. I am not open about these assumptions with many people. 

My life (the good part)-&gt; these symptoms and this condition does not define or control my life. I am 31. I have not taken anti psychotics or anti depressants in more than 10 years. I can listen to 3 or 4 audio sources simultaneously and easily recognize complex patterns. I have many different perspectives on most problems,  because I have at least two other viewpoints reading over my shoulder or listening in most of the time. 

I have built a career in IT moving from end user support to management, and then on  to systems architecture and integration. Me and my wife separated last year,  but that not negative.  My son lives with me full time and is growing into an amazing person. 

I am happy,  not every second of every day,  but that's not reasonable.  My life is damn good. I take days off that I wouldn't otherwise take if it weren't for my head. I ask my parents and friends for help when I need it and try like hell not to isolate myself.  I see a therapist. 

This condition is not easily,  it is not simple, and it cannot be ignored or eliminated with a pill. (Medications help most,  if they help you that is wonderful, please continue to follow the advice of your Doctor) 

Every one who struggles with any aspect of schizophrenia knows that it will eat you alive if you let it.  If you're still struggling and living you are incredible,  that is amazing,  keep going.  I think that those who are able to move past the struggle to survive will find the rest of life is a easy by comparison.

Mad_Squid,,,,,t2_brxheag,"Yeah it looks a lot better with colour! If you saw it before it was finished then I definitely need to show you. I'll show you the tattoos on my other arm. I have full sleeves planned when I can afford them. I got an eagle to celebrate my AFL team West Coast Eagles winning the grandfinal last year. Sorry but I can't mention AFL on reddit without showing the final few minutes of the grandfinal haha it was a classic and I rewatch it a lot. Im a member and go to all 11 home games a year so yeah big fan. 

The final round before finals is this weekend actually and we're currently 3rd (top 8 play finals but only top 4 is a realistic chance of winnning. Only one team has won from 5-8 in 20 years) We can finish anywhere from 1st to 5th (love it when the ladder is close). We just need to win tomorrow and we'll most likely finish 3rd, 2nd at best realistically. We can only statistically finish 1st. If we lose and both 4th and 5th win we will drop to 5th and back to back flags will become unlikely, but 5th is versing 7th and 4th is playing 1st so it'll all have to go wrong for that to happen. 

I also want to say the team who are 1st Brisbane Lions are my second team because I was born in Toowomba 2 hours away from there (but moved to Perth when I was 6 and have lived here since). They haven't made finals since 2009 (longest current finaslls drought) and last week they played 2nd who were 1st at the time and had been nearly all year and won by 1 point in an absolute thriller to end the round on top of the ladder for the first time since 2004 (They won 3 flags in a row 2001-2003 and lost the grandfinal in 2004). Was also their 9th win in a row. So yeah exciting times. I really hope the grandfinal is West Coast vs Brisbane, then I'll be happy with either result, but obvisouly will be barracking for West Coast.

But yeah we're playing 9th who will play finals if they win and 8th loses (who are playing 10th and can make finals if they win. 11th can also make it) There's 4 teams playing for 8th spot so it's tight. And their captain retired last week so they'll be inspired. Not to mention they're the most successful team of the modern era winning grandfinals in 2008, 2013, 2014 and 2015 so they are a damn good team when in form. They even still have the same coach who won them the 4 flags. So yeah this game has very high stakes and should be a classic. Anyway that's my afl ramble, hope it was somewhat interesting. Oh and the other tattoo is 2 grizzly bears cause I think they're cool lol

It's an Aussie comedy-action series about spies fighting Hitler and dinosaurs and mutant creatures and shit. There's this running gag where every time they catch Hitler he escapes by jumping through a window and its the same footage every time. It's hilarious. 

I'm Aussie so its good to have a show to be proud of for once! All our other shows are complete shite. I watched like one season in 2014 when I was in Canada.

Zakh77,,,,,t2_128shw,"My focus is when someone is initially being diagnosed by their physician, a brain scan should be one of the first tools that the physician uses. When I saw my first psychiatrist, she mentioned that the (state) hospital no longer prescribed Benzodiazepines because not only were they addictive, but they were known to cause brain damage, as well as a few other medications. I did some digging around and found similar claims. 

The fact remains that there is potential for some of the drugs prescribed for schizophrenia and similar disorders to cause brain damage after prolonged use. And because of that potential, there is more than a good enough reason to have a follow up scan at least every other year, especially if the patient has remained on one drug for an extended of period of time ; I'll just say a year or longer.

There's more or less smaller trials demonstrating slight improvement or no improvement of certain things combined with clozapine and case studies of individuals and their story (e.g. your medications alongside descriptions of how you got each one). The first strategy is to combine clozapine with a first generation AP, the logic being to piggyback on two somewhat different methods of actions in the brain, hoping for improvement.

I asked my primary care for a referral for HRT and they didn't question it. My endocrinologist only asked if I felt comfortable transitioning with where my symptoms are at now. I said yes, of course.

For other MTFs: estrogen supposedly helps with schizophrenic symptoms.

freedomwoodstock69,,,01bfa41e-ed95-11e8-a458-0ece30058aee,Schizophrenia,t2_3vm9qodt,"My first episode had doctors thinking I was bipolar as I was experiencing highs and lows. I spoke very monotone at times and was acting out by playing music really loudly in the adolescent ward. I also thought I saw lights in my vision at this time. Looking back I feel I was experiencing highs and lows due to my environmental factors which included psychological and physical abuse.

Fast forward a few years and I was smoking weed chronically, going into my own little world every time which I now recognize as going into psychosis. I would hallucinate bright lights and things around me seemed to appear as if they were far away in a tunnel.
I ended up doing mdma which set me over the edge. Wound up experiencing every kind of delusion. I thought MTV was talking to me on my TV; they were following me; there were cameras everywhere recording me (Truman delusion); that Rihanna loved me and other artists wrote music specifically for me;  Jimi Hendrix was my father and I was his son;  I was the returned Jesus; that nurses and doctors were angels; that I was becoming God; that all media was intended for me and that nurses and doctors were attempting to take my power etc.
I spent 4 months in seclusion, unresponsive to meds, which finally granted me the diagnosis of treatment resistant schizoaffective disorder as doctors thought I was manic after I exhibited a lot of energy and fluctuating moods. They placed me on clozapine which didn't help but stop my disorganized thought and delusions. My mind was numb on the medication, I felt like a zombie who had a minimal ability to think.
I came off medications many times  because I didn't believe my diagnosis which resulted in me going on various other medications.
Two years ago I came off olanzapine because I couldn't think much and was convinced I wasn't sick because I couldn't remember my episodes. Had a very similar experience to my first major episode but I remember now that I was hearing voices; thinking the universe was talking to me as a whole; that I could manipulate the universe with my mind; that I could telepathically talk to people among other delusions. I hallucinated lights which I did to this day. I also had every kind of disorganized thought. I would say things like ""the lemon is pure because it is blue and I know it too"" etc completely unable to converse coherently for months.
Recently I have been placed on invega monthly shots and 5mg to 10mg of olanzapine daily. My diagnosis has been changed to schizophrenia as my former mood issues are now considered to be a product of psychosis.
I have experienced every symptom of the illness, and to be honest it's as simple as is written on most sources that describe it.
One more thought though: this was all very intoxicating and empowering even in my worst of days. My major episodes always last months if I come off meds and are always very similar.
The most important thing though is for years I didn't believe I had mental illness. Some people including family members discredited it and others gaslighted my every flaw and action as being a product of illness which led to me not trusting doctors or the opinion of family.",,,1570117423,,,f2aszfi,False,t3_dbbcat,,True,t3_dbbcat,/r/schizophrenia/comments/dbbcat/hello_everyone/f2aszfi/,,1570119642,1,,True,False,schizophrenia,t5_2r828,,,,#dadada,[],dark,text,,,,,False,{},,[],False,0.0,[],[],,,,,

I have always experienced Vivid dreams and déjà vu that has come true and lucid dreaming but Its not something I openly discus. Although I can promise this is very very different. moving artwork, believing tv  characters are talking to you, thinking he can control traffic because the lights changed, believing there are hidden cameras everywhere including in the home, complete personality changes into a child like state when stressed, I can go on but these are all symptoms of schizophrenia, or something similar. he has bipolar which several doctors believe may have progressed. 

 You honestly can’t sum this all up to being physicic when I have had to calm him down rocking in a child like state just repeating “ we can’t sleep the bad men come when you sleep that’s when they come when you sleep the bad men come in your sleep the bad men come in your sleep the bad men come in your sleep” over and over and over he didn’t even really see I was there and I ( for the first time) felt worried for my safety In case he lashed out. It’s terrifying. I’ve had to distract and lie to him on the phone when he is telling me his brothers (who are both in jail) are bringing his baby’s to see him in the car. He has no children. When I said they wasn’t he began panicking about the safety and whereabouts  of these none existent children so I had to just encourage him to sleep saying they would be coming in the morning.  He has no recollection of these episodes. Luckily I’ve worked with dementia patients which often present similar dilusions so I responded how I would to them, distraction. It’s very worrying that he can have hours or days  where he is a completely different person and it has a massive toll on our relationship. Please don’t for a second think this is as simple as a few ghosts.

He sees this ending one or two ways, death or jail if left to continue and I completely agree, it’s so upsetting and very urgent.

Im on a hypothesis that schizophrenic people can see through the veil but im still not sure so thats why i like to watch this sub. 

My suggestion is, dont freak out too much when he sees things. There is more between heaven and earth. I can also recommend a few books about Metaphysica, toaisme, out of body experience by Dr. Robert monroe. There are many more people who are sensitive and can see things. I know some and i have high regards in them. They both have an own company and are high functioning people. 

I ofcourse also recommend to see a therapist about this. But i can recommend a good medium more. They have more experience with those entities. As for example, you attract what you think or feel. So if youre feeling bad or negative, you attract negativity, thats the law of attraction. On yt there is a channel named SpiritScience. Its very interesting and maybe that can give more answers. 

Ive also studied a lot about out of body experiences, and there is a study that shows that schizophrenics have a high percentage of this happening natural to them, hence why my hypothesis is that theyre sensitive to the world most of us cannot see or hear.

A bit of it is that there are outliers that sort of counterbalance each other: there is a group of people with late onset schizophrenia. Sometimes you hear from a few of them on this sub, but not often. But then the majority have an onset between their late teens and early 30s. 

Some people have an early onset but they remain unobserved by a doctor and thus undiagnosed for a long while. That can be due to a number of factors, including the person’s insight into their symptoms, the relative severity of their symptoms, and how well they’re able to cope and function to at least some degree so their condition doesn’t become suspicious to others. And there is some debate among doctors about whether you record the onset of these cases from the stated time of onset (whatever age the person recounts themselves as being), or from the time they’re diagnosed by a doctor (say, in their 20s or 30s). 

I think the main thing is that most doctors are unwilling to diagnose children and young adults. I’ve heard several reasons for this, from: it takes a while to be certain the mind has matured enough that it’s actually psychosis, to the severity of the illness and the stigma associated with it being too much to place on a child. I’m sure there are others. But you’ll hear a lot of stories about people who presented with symptoms, and their doctors waited to diagnose them until they were 16 or 18. That is bound to skew the numbers

lalasalala,1515885460.0,,,,t2_rwj4osz,"I'd say start by ditching the weed for a while. It can be an important factor, and even if it isn't the cause, it's probably making it worse allround, not just while smoking. If you can't lay it down completely, try cutting down on amount and frequency.

After that, establishing a solid routine in daily life to stabilise yourself + keep yourself active while also practicing stress reduction and management can help. Sleep is priority #1, even just an hour too little sleep can make me more likely to slip completely and get much more psychotic symptoms.

Try to keep stuff like alcohol and caffeine down as well, and eat well.

The quetiapine drowsiness should wear off with time as your body gets used to it, shouldn't take too long while on 25mg. Sleeping after taking it could help too, lets you sleep through most the drowsiness + get the bonuses of both sleep and an antipsychotic at the same time. Though, quetiapine is normally used at much higher doses for psychosis, so if nothing else helps you might wanna bring that and the leds discussion up with your team again.

pdinh26,1520209092.0,,,,t2_zxhfa8l,"Unfortunately, it has a lot to do with genetics and the environment you're in. When I was isolated from the world with mental problems, I hardly wanted to do anything. I had a terrible attention-span, I would have to take so many 'focus' pills (amphetamines, caffeine, L-Theanine, Multivitamins) to give me some level of direction for doing even the most simple task because I had severe brain fog. Then I did cardio workouts for 4 hours and hot yoga classes for 10 hours a week. I drank tons of water, fruits, vegetables and whatever I believed would benefit me the most every single day. I did this for around 6 years. Do you know what happened after 6 years? I still felt terrible. I would momentarily feel content after every workout because of the endorphins. But then that would soon fade. After doing everything I possibly can to better myself in those 6 years. Neuroplasticity began to take place. I'm sure I was building synaptic connections before, but it was going so slowly.. I could hardly tell. I was finally able to function at a high-level and hardly have to take any drugs to get where I want to be mentally.

The point I'm making is this: You have to somehow force yourself to be as productive as you possibly can. No matter how much it sucks. Good things hardly happen to people that always victimize themselves. If your hallucinations are severe, keep searching for medication that can suppress it. Play by ear, do everything you possibly can to better yourself. 

You feel unmotivated, but you KNOW that something is amiss. You want to fill some void and that answer isn't going to come from staring into space and thinking about how weak you are. Even if it feels uncomfortable now, you have to FORCE yourself to be motivated. If it's not possible mentally, then find the proper medication or supplement. And ALWAYS mentally condition yourself every day. Do not give up. Please don't. I felt like a brainless zombie for most of my life. Literally, it took nearly my whole life to get me where I wanted to be mentally and that was due to constantly pushing myself. We also do not live in a love planet. Sorry to say, so you gotta just keep yourself busy.

I know how hard it is, trust me. Having auditory hallucinations, feeling like a zombie on a daily-basis, with manic depression, and mood swings is tough.

If she doesn't have any refills left, you could call her old psych's office or old GP's office and see if they can't phone over an emergency fill for a month, that also isn't particularly uncommon. However, it's also not a sure bet, so make those calls before you start banking on it.

If all that fails, you might have to pay out of pocket for a visit to a GP. It sucks, I know, but it beats the hell out of paying a huge bill for the psych ward. A lot of GP's offices will do payment plans if you're in seriously dire straights, too.

This ego thing is something that I have recently read about actually like the past week and have not done any drugs associating with it. After reading articles I thought to myself “this seems great and all, but what about those with schizophrenia? How would they be able to achieve this?” And this is where I’m at now. I’m not in any way shape or form comparing my experiences or romanticizing them to what you’ve been through. I literally want a better understanding of what someone like you goes through and how their brain works. I find this very interesting because it’s something I really don’t understand at all. I honestly haven’t done psychedelics that much, only lsd a handful of times. I appreciate you taking time to answer my questions. 

You don’t have to answer this at all if you don’t want to or don’t have to go into details. With “coping” and dealing with changes, are you in therapy or taking medication? Thanks again for your response :) 

Edit: I have been hospitalized once and I believe someone in there had schizophrenia. He was very out of it. Like a walking zombie. He had been in an episode for a few weeks.

I'm referring to psychosis. The closest you've ever been to psychosis is through hallucinogenic drugs, and trust me when I say that it is not  a very representative experience. Hallucinogens are *nothing* compared to the horror of a psychotic break. 

&gt;If you don’t mind me asking, how do you cope and deal with the changes?

*I don't*. My world gets more confusing and tenuous after every break, and ""dealing"" with it is like learning to live with a broken arm. I become worse for it, slightly less able to function and think. It doesn't replace or upgrade any part of my mind, it destroys it. Psychotic episodes have been observed to literally destroy brain cells. 

&gt;Ego isn’t about being in touch with the world, but being in touch with yourself better :)

And that's slowly eroded with time too. I can feel myself slipping away day by day, replaced with nothing. I forget who I am and what year it is. There's nothing but constant yelling and things around me twist and change colour. I don't have the luxury to have any kind of identity at those times, and I'd barely consider myself human. 

&gt;Part of achieving your true self would be: non judgemental, grateful, loving of yourself, focused in the now, accepting of others, non victim mentality, etc.

I'm more judgemental than ever, I despise the life I have, I fucking hate myself, I can't focus on any point in time, I'm certainly less accepting of people than ever, and my illness absolutely makes me its victim. 

&gt;Are you able to differentiate between thoughts, feelings, intuition, and sensations??

No. I can't tell which are my thoughts and which aren't. I can't tell what sensations are real and which aren't. My intuition is telling me to punch through a window and then remove my arms, but I doubt that's the best course of action. I can't recognize feelings outside of ""bad"" and ""good"".

You seem to have greatly romanticised something which you have absolutely no experience with. Your tame meddling with drugs doesn't come close. It's like comparing laser tag with actual war and then trying to convince veterans with PTSD that their experiences were enlightening and anything less than soul-destroying.

FoamyWizard,1522512357.0,,,,t2_13u8rw06,"I definitely feel this way. Although on the surface it can really feel awful, I find making the most of my time useful by connecting with myself more. Many people won’t want to talk to us for some reason. But by learning how to live in a way that doesn’t depend on the validation, support and conventional aspects of friendship of others, we actually have a very unique experience, one that allows us to be formidably independent and psychologically strong if we can have the self preservation to leave behind the old ways of thinking that were once applicable to us.

For the past 5 years I’ve been dealing with the “illness” but have long since left behind that mode of thought, because it grossly fails to comprehend the totality of my experience as a human, especially as a human with anomalous experiences.

Although there are brief moments where I miss the past, I always try to support myself mentally in the present and have found my experiences to be meaningful, despite the obvious pitfalls of loneliness and isolation.

Growth is always possible. Hope is always there.

Don’t let the common ways dictate your experience negatively. Don’t let the fact that you are unique be a negative force in your life.

I can’t help but see my mind as potential. Of all the absolute SHIT in our world, I have the capacity to envision something better and live in that vision everyday. I am the pioneer of my soul.

I really underestimated Social Workers, till my sister got her MSW and I saw what they did. If you get one who knows his/her stuff and really cares, they can make some miracles happen. What's better is, all the education that goes in to it, it's very rare to find one that DOESN'T care. They're in it for you. They want to help you in any way they can, even if that means giving you to someone else. I've met some therapists who are in it more for the money, and it shows in their efficacy. I'm glad you were able to find the treatment that helped you!

Now, that I can't say 100%. I feel like that may be skewed, as a large amount of adults who need a social worker are those with conditions such as SZD or PTSD. I know my sister, for example, is going to be working with people who have lost their lives to addiction. She's in the Correctional Facility (read: jail) and meets with people who want to turn their life around, giving them counseling, goals, and all sorts of great things. Also, while I did see this in a meme, I feel like it was true to some degree: People with SZD have the some of the best therapists in the field because it's such an interesting condition.

Hey! To start, yes I am on medication. I am on 10mg Olanzapine PO nightly. I have been...not so good with taking it recently, but I am trying hard to get back on track.
Now, that's a tricky question. USUALLY, when we have a stress on a neuron that's causing this type of pruning, it's because of Depression, and we throw you on an SSRI. The theory here is that more 5-HT = more 5-HT2a activation, which means more BDNF is produced. BDNF is a Neurotropin, which causes many different effects in a cell, ultimately ending in increased cell survival and growth. The dendrites (and therefore, synapses), are more likely to survive, with new ones growing, potentially reconnecting the lost circuits. The problem here is, 5-HT2a agonism is responsible for a a special feedback loop in the brain. During acute psychosis, this specific feedback loop becomes so powerful and self-potentiating, it overpowers the thalamus, so signals are flying across the brain, allowing parts of the brain to talk that really shouldn't. We could POSSIBLY activate this receptor if we begun to antagonize the other receptor, but that would require us to scrap nearly all of our current medicines.  
Next up: we could use the same idea that Ketamine treatment uses. While giving ketamine itself is a terrible idea (NDMA antagnoism starts the whole chain of disruption), its metabolite, Hydroxynorketamine, is a potent AMPA agonist. Honestly... this is promising, I had never thought about it before today. I'll do research on this as a treatment next year in my Uni. The idea here is that activation of the AMPA receptor in the way HNK does will cause an activation of a special cell pathway, called mTOR. This causes rapid growth of spine dendrites, specifically in the PFC (where all the oxidative stress is from SZD!). On top of this, AMPA deficiencies are what contribute to the long-term loss of brain volume.  
Finally: histone deactylase inhibitors. This goes back to the idea of BDNF. Long story short: Histone Deacetylase inhibitors cause an increase in BDNF, which could lead to the therapeutic effects without going through the 5-HT2a pathway (which would kickstart an episode).",True,0.0,1526536289,,0.0,dz48cp3,False,t3_8jkcvi,4.0,True,t1_dz29nj9,/r/schizophrenia/comments/8jkcvi/huge_conversation_thread_at_rscience_about/dz48cp3/,78975.0,1527563804,1,False,True,False,schizophrenia,t5_2r828,public,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seems you have a bit more experinece with this than I do, though I'm not sure of your age lol I don't mean to sound offesive btw I'm 36 now, was originally diagnosed at 23, but the onset was much earlier than that,about 12-13ish. You mentioned a possible misdiagnoses which came from your doctor, and actually I can relate on that. I've had doctors try to write me off as psychotic depression, which I don't really expeience depression for long periods of time, but do deal with mania here and there. Honestly, before I agreed to take my meds that I'm taking now, I did a TON of research on capabilities, side effects and long term effects as well. I used to be on seroquel, was on that for years. Then got switched to risperdal twice daily along lithium and an ""anti-convulsant"" to ward off the tremors that come with the risperidone. Now it seems they want to keep going back and forth between a lower dose of risperidone,4mg and latuda, which I did take for a little while but my insurance is pretty picky on what they cover and what they don't. I've gotten into the habit of documenting my thoughts, since I struggle with memory and other cogntivie stuff on top of negative and positive symptoms as well as how the meds make feel feel and other noticeable side effects. Have you found anything that helps out with your neg. symptoms? I can't really seem to find anything that works for me. The dollar amount on your ssi sounds about right. I think it would be about the same here, maybe a little less from my understanding. I'm not applying for SSDI because I would like for this to be short term, but I tend to set these boundaries. This is where depression kicks in when these goals arent met. I lack motivation for sure, that seems to be long gone as well as any joy or interest in life in general. I would like that back one of these decades haha
 I understand where you come from completely, I found this to be very useful information. I honestly wish I had internet back in high school ,or the resources we do now. If I had that back in high school when my initial onset began, I think managing wouldn't be so hard or difficult. Paranoia still kicks my ass to this very day, and it's been 14 years since my diagnoses. It still sucks, and I feel like I'm still adjusting to the ""new me"". I don't have many friends, so just talking to you brought a sense of relief. I've googled my symtoms and pretty much every single one matches up with the diagnostic material that I'm finding. After my last break, I did a lot of researching when he tried telling me I was bipolar and not schizophrenic. I even brought material back to the hospital to show him the difference betweeen the two and got that reversed. Bipolar does run on my mothers side as well, the schizophrenia runs on my father side. My bio-dad has paranoid schizophrenia as well. Pretty much everything you just told me makes a lot of sense. I don't take one doctors word for it, I tend to go behind my doctors back and get 2nd and 3rd opinions on the matter. I've contaded psychologists to see their input on the mattter as well as a neurologist in my area. I will totally agree by saying that knowledge is power. How long did it take you to get your personality back? That's the main complaint I have about risperidone. I don't notice weight gain at all. If anything I feel I'm losing weight, no metabolism changes that I've noticed, but I go in for my yearly exam next month to check everything out. Im having a blood test done as well to kind of rule some things out. So I mean I'm aware that it's my right to refuse, but what about ward rules? I was forcibly injected during my last stay because they found me to be a threat to myself and others because I was delusional and hyperactive. They literally pinned me down and shot me in the bum. I'm in the usa if it matters, but I thought that was illegal. I won't go back to THAT hospital becuase I felt like my info was leaked. I could go into detail, but since nothing can be proven or disproved, I probably shouldn't jump to conclusions. I can tell right now you've done a TON of research. I could learn a lot from you. As far as work, I feel I might be able to pull of a part time job working like 3-4 hours, but past that I'm not real sure at this point. I would love to say I can go out and work a full time job again, that's my primary goal to gain back my independence and kick schizophrenias ass. My family tends to blame my beliefs on conspiracy theories, but they're theories are my reality. That's the crappy part, and it's still hard to deal with after so many years. For a long,long time I was in denial. I went most of my high school days unmedicated, even though I was hospitalized many,many times. I really do wish I had the knowledge back then that I have now, I would have realized much sooner, and I think the treatment would have gone a little smoother. But I don't heavily rely on medications and psychotherapy, but it does help. I don't know if it's just me, but how does caffeine make you feel? For me it seems like it almost triggers mania if I drink a lot of coffee, I do smoke cigarettes which is bad, but it seems it puts my mind at ease. I need to quit. I smoke like a pack per day at least.

That's not to say that therapy doesn't help--it does--but it would be irresponsible of your doctor to avoid sending you to a psychiatrist for diagnosis and treatment. I will note, though, that a good psychiatrist should be able to direct you toward a therapist. If not, you can find one yourself. There are plenty of clinical psychologists and social workers.

One of the other reasons why your doctor sends you to someone who can medicate you is that a lot of psychologists use outdated psychoanalytic philosophies, such as from Jung or Freud. You need to find a therapist who provides cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

Don't trust anybody who tries to tell you not to take meds. Meds are effective for most of us, after a period of trying various ones in order to find the best mixture.

'Thought broadcasting' isn't necessarily a real phenomenon, but everybody reacts in observable ways to emotion (i.e. body language) that we can pick up on with each other. As far as I know, schizophrenic people are a tad more sensitive to influences from otherwise subconscious cues like these and tend to mimic other people's body language. Now being acutely attuned to pick up things like actual coherent thoughts... *that* is not possible.

So yeah, it's not completely crazy, and honestly you're going to drive yourself a lot more bonkers trying to convince yourself that it's completely not real rather than accepting that you're just overestimating the impacts of relatively mundane actions.

I do a few things that help me cope:

-Think of it as a perspective issue. I might be inclined to incorrectly link cause and effect. For example, if a person looks at me weird right after I think something bad about them, it might've been because of my facial expression or body language... not because they're actually hearing my thoughts! When my symptoms come on heavy, I tend to make these unhealthy connections more. ""A person next to me just coughed? Oh, were they responding to that thought I just had?"" Stuff like this. In my opinion, it's just a pattern of thought. The more I feed into it, the more likely I'll be to think this way... so I just try to rationalize everything... and bring myself to a healthy headspace. ""Oh, that person coughed simply because they had to. Not only that, they didn't even notice me/weren't thinking about me.""

-Realize everyone is too busy with their own thoughts to be ""listening"" to my thoughts.

-Try to focus on what I'm actually communicating instead of worrying about what I'm ""broadcasting"". If I'm having a conversation with someone and I have a rude thought about them (I tend to that a lot), I'll say something polite instead.

SDezzles,1447204740.0,,,,t2_rx9is,"Yeah, it is a shame. Especially because shamans had such a high status. Instead of being outcasts, they were given responsibilities.
 
In my (very uninformed) opinion, I think that you could potentially replicate some of the benefits by taking on responsibilities for yourself. If you have trouble with this, start small and focus on keeping your desk clean, then your room etc. Take up a new language or skill. Make sure to exercise every day, even if it's just a walk. Also, maybe go on a journey that gets you out of your comfort zone! By holding yourself to a high standard, you make your mind stronger and more in control. I think this was a large component of the shamanic initiation.

Just my two cents!

Geetar, I’m sorry you had to go through that. Don’t beat yourself up about your past. I too had a pretty traumatic and TURBULENT childhood and ended up with Crohn’s disease! I’ve stopped ruminating over my childhood and what could have been. More so after witnessing children with better families than mine, suffering from this illness. 

Look into Bethany Yeiser, she claims to have led a great life prior to Schizophrenia. Fun shit, you know....genetics and all. Im glad you’ve reached common ground with your mom though. I agree with you on the slippery slope analogy but something has got to give. I’m studying health services administration and plan on entering the mental health field. *Raises glass* May we accomplish many great things in the name of mankind! Best of wishes on your journey! 

Also, It’s said everyone has schiz traits, we are all on a continuum. Hope I worded that correctly. As a kid, and a few times in adulthood, Ive experienced some strange visions, whispers and laughing voices. Sleep paralysis as well and the odd feeling someone is behind me.

Myrrsha,1484247742.0,,,,,"My parents divorced when I was 6. My mother was abusive to my dad and older sisters, beating them, starving my sisters, choking them if they did the laundry wrong, almost killed them multiple times, and a lot of other worse things. She had partial custody and didn't really care about me till I was 10. Her and my dad went through huge child custody battles until I was an adult; it got so bad that it went to Georgia Supreme Court 3 times. When I visited her, she would starve me, leave me in public places and not come back, scream at me and said she hated me. She also brought guys over all the time, and a lot of them happened to be pedophiles. She left me alone with them constantly, so I was raped in elementary school and some of middle school for years. They also took child porn of me.

I moved out to Texas when I was 14. My Stepmom became incredibly abusive to my sister and I, as well as my dad. End of freshman year, I started dating someone who claimed to be schizophrenic, and after we broke up, he kept lying for attention and convinced me to attempt suicide. While all of that was happening, I was being raped by the bf I was dating that time. I attempted suicide a few times and got sent to a terrible mental health center for a week. I didn't get medicated, even though I needed it. I struggled through school not knowing what mental illnesses I had and I was very lost, and self harming a lot.

I moved back to Georgia in August 2016. Best damn thing that ever happened. I got with my current fiance, and got the help I needed. I was diagnosed with Dissociative identity disorder, schizophrenia, ptsd, body dysmorphia, major depressive disorder, borderline personality disorder, and a few more minor ones. I found out that I had tactile hallucinations my whole life, so severe I couldn't be left alone especially in the dark, out of fear of a monster killing me or torturing me. I had lots of voices in my head and lots of intrusive images and impulses of killing and torturing people I love. It was hard to function because I would have psychotic breakdowns several times a week for years. I also had to deal with alters, some good and some bad. I have very severe amnesia; I don't remember the first 14 years of my life, and the only reason I can recall anything is through years of therapy.

That's probably a good portion of it. Mostly just the general stuff, so I probably missed a lot of details.

Your fear should target negative symptoms not anti-psychotics. That anti-psychotics cause negative symptoms is a myth.

Creativity is not underrated in our world. I live in a first world country. Every school here is required by law to give creative education to every student in every year during their enrollment. Successful creative people are glamorized to an extent almost no other profession is.

whatisthisglass,,,,,,"I took anti psychotics. But only for half a year. Didn't effect me much in the creativity department. Definitely helped me realizing that I am not some gifted musician or something, which in turn helped me relax a lot more and be more positive towards my guitar playing.

I had lots of delusions about art. Sure, the over ladden super meaning of these delusions resulted in interesting pieces (poems, stories and music). But on the other hand they were very fractured, under-produced and I think their ""interesting-ness"" can wholly be attributed to having been composed in another mind-state.

whatisthisglass,,,,,,"In my opinion you should go see a doctor (which is the first step to getting therapy, you can't just go directly to a therapist). A doctor will refer you to a psychiatrist, which will then give you a first preliminary opinion and very likely low-doses of medication to see how you react to it. After a while the psychiatrist will decide on his diagnosis and you will get the according treatment which can include therapy but might not. For most psychological issues therapy is recommended though, as far as I know.

I can relate to your experience of having felt the need to be ""the stoic one"" in the family which is why I definitely recommend you to start seeking treatment. It will help you.

I was a very independent minded person in my youth and had a very hard time accepting that analyzing myself on my own was not a very fruitful endeavor. Psychoanalysis and psychodynamics are very complex subjects that have been developed through several hundreds of lifetimes of work. Trying do something like this alone is going to be way too hard and not very productive.

Also consider the effects of not seeking treatment. You can go through life living with the pain and suffering, but this also puts you in danger of developing even more problems that might be caused by constant negative emotions. Your brain produces chemicals according to your emotional state and vice versa, this creates a biological dynamic that can even become self-propagating, this chemical dynamic in turn can alter how certain parts of your other biology function. In the last few weeks for example I realized that I have developed bladder problems that were very likely caused by neurobiological issues connected to schizophrenia and other mental health issues I suffer from. Now, this might not sound very bad, but consider that there is a multitude of issues that can arise from constantly negative brain chemistry that is not limited to bad stuff happening within ""your soul"" and that treatment is the best way and among the few certifiable options of cure and prevention available to you.

Also, you don't need to feel bad because you have insight into your condition and it doesn't help you. That is actually a cognitive mistake. Insight does not automatically imply ability to change or withstand stress. I can easily understand that I will die someday but that doesn't mean that dealing with my own death is always easy. Ultimately, if you want to cure yourself with self-analysis you have to become philosophical about it. And that takes a lot of work and time. Also, because people with depression, schizophrenia and other issues have more problems with unbiased and cognitive thinking and rational judgments you will have a harder time analyzing yourself, thereby making it even more pointless. Not to mention that studies show that introspective analysis is highly unreliable anyways. 

I am really trying to convince you to seek professional treatment because I know the problem with guilt is that it ultimately feels right to you that you suffer; so that even the idea of seeking treatment feels just incredibly wrong.

I don't really want to go too deep into my own past with experiences of guilt because it obviously brings back a lot of painful memories. But generally it had a lot of delusional qualities, like magically connecting bad events in my environment to me as well as feeling connected to natural catastrophes. It was also a part of me for a very, very long time; I couldn't be convinced otherwise despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary and I made a lot of very poor life decisions based on my delusional belief in guilt.

Edit: Thought about your description again: if you can't shake the idea that you are guilty, despite being reminded that you have no need to, that should satisfy one of the key criteria (incorrigibility) for classifying delusions. Whether that is a schizophrenic delusion is another question. People with depression can develop delusions just as well.

2. Alcohol, once or twice a week from 21-25 Marijuana, once a year or less.

3. I had symptoms, but I didn't realize they were symptoms of schizophrenia. I was a paranoid wreck. I kept changing jobs because I thought they were going to fire me (they had no reason, I was loved). I was also an overachiever with an engineering degree and a lot of ambition. I was able to get things done that other people couldn't. I'd also pace for hours, and keep looking out the blinds. I had no reason to, but I just kept doing it.

4.   The medication has been brutal. I question sometimes whether the treatment is worse than the condition. I feel that they have blunted my cognition, and robbed me of most of my feelings of enjoyment. They do beat living in a mental hospital though, so I take them for the benefit of everyone around me.

5.   I have a very different perspective on life and self. My cohesiveness has been shattered - there is no me. There are a collection of mechanisms that make up my mind, and the concept of me is an illusion put forward by those parts.

It explored the causes and history of voice hearing and the current community movement associated with it, it was a very enjoyable read that towed the line of being quite easy to read while also being quite in depth. Whether clinician, patient, or just keen on the subject I'd recommend it. 

One of the major points of the book is in regards to the fact that a significant amount of voice hearers do not consider the condition as pathology and do not present with the other more troubling symptoms of schizophrenia in every case. 

Also that medication is mostly ineffective at completely eradicating the voices and that coming to terms and engaging the content of the voices is much more therapeutically valuable than trying to suppress them. 

I have never liked how hallucinations have simply been cast by clinicians as a mistake of the brain, or something completely undesirable. In my mind momentary double vision, visual snow or tricks of the eye are more in line with visual mistakes.

My libido grew ten fold. My orgasms became mind blowing. Lots of precum. Lol sorry if this is tmi, just the biggest differences I noticed. It helped me have more energy throughout the day.

vaderchrist,1512165415.0,,,,t2_jugedwh,"Thanks for the reply.

Kinda funny that you mention Wellbutrin. I thought about it after making this post and decided I'll probably try that first since it has stimulating effects and most likely won't worsen psychosis. I was on it before but for a short period of time. How long does it typically take to start working? Also, if you don't mind sharing, were there any side-effects?

goldyroll,1513717691.0,,,,t2_owsnx97,"Do he have a history of substance abuse? That would be a good place to start. Stimulants are notorious for inducing psychotic behavior. Speed/meth/cocaine especially when a binge continues for multiple days and night. Sleep deprivation, dehydration, hunger and overheating of the body’s core temperature are enough to stir up anyone’s psychological mindset. Uppers (as the cool kids call them), will spin you like a drill until you’re out of pleasure juice, thrillerade and dignity. 

Don’t ask me how I have so much frontline data. It is now and always will be now. Wake up now. Go to sleep now. Eat now. Now isn’t a good time. I’m here now possibly geometrists too.

It would have been another great read for someone unfamiliar with the way my mind takes over the ship. I stumbled upon a notebook that I had during a long strange trip to the mysterious land of delusions. Where they critique me from outside the house until morning. I know they don’t like me but they have so much dirt on me I have to be cool and calm to keep the peace. I don’t think the kids who installed the surveillance cameras, mics in my house are the only ones who remote access my devices. They destroyed my laptop with malware last week. I’m sorry wife but you might be an internet star soon. Soooo many nsfw pics and vids of her and me. Maybe some others too. Damn. Fuck internet. I’m not trying to be right about this but I’m thinking maybe since so many of my delusions have turned into realities that I’m some kind of mother fucking sleeper agent.
