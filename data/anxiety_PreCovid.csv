I’ve had an endoscopy, colonoscopy, gallbladder removed and I’m only 23 lol my body sucks. My biggest fear used to be needles. I fainted when I had to get shots or blood drawn. Also I have acute gen anxiety and panic disorder. Anyway. I started giving blood to help me fear. And it actually helped a lot. Now i just dislike needles. So. I went in at 10:30am, waited in the lobby for like an hour and then they took me back in this big nice hospital to the gastro office thing. And gave me a gown and I sat there for like half an hour. My cousin came with me. They asked about my meds and shit. They gave me an IV in my hand (we were bitching right before that about how the hand is the worst) but it’s because you might bend your arms in your sleep which would kink the anesthesia hose thing. And that would suck way more. So I just tried to not think about it and propped my hand up so it wouldn’t move and feel weird 😹 I basically harassed the nurses and asked them if everyone was pretty sure they’d wake up during it and they said yes of course everyone thinks that. And I said ok cool just checking. Then the anesthetist nurse came and asked me questions and stuff. Then they took me back to the bright room w all the computers and stuff and the doctor came in and we talked and everyone got there. and they were like put this plastic thing in your mouth so you don’t bite the camera and turn on your left side.  Sorry don’t be mad but they put a blood pressure cuff on so they can use the IV because if it’s too low they don’t want to give you too much anesthesia you know. So they started the sleepy medicine in the IV and I was like, I’m totally gonna fight it I can stay awake. And in 0.5 seconds I was knocked the fuck out. I took a hard 20 min nap, woke up picking my nose and talking about pancakes. My cousin took me for pancakes and then I slept w my dog for like 6 hours. And I just drove myself to get ice cream (probly a little too soon heh) and I feel groggy and totally fine otherwise. I was scared because the first time I didn’t know what to expect. This one was an underwhelming waste my day off but hopefully I get some answers. Good luck! You’ll be fine. It’s not bad at all. Take a podcast cuz there’s lots of waiting time.

dronethis,1425426865.0,,,,,,,,t2_luti4,"Hey, I’m proud of you! The Disorders™️ try to make you feel helpless; by trying something, you’re challenging that notion. 

As for the medication itself, my practical advice is:

1.	**Feel free to treat the side effects.** The last time I was starting a new antidepressant, I had some nausea and headaches. I bought some anti-nausea medication and ate stuff that was gentle on my stomache, and took OTC painkillers for the headaches. It’s strangely easy to forget there are medicines and lifestyle changes that can help with various side effects. So here’s my reminder :)
2.	**If this medication doesn’t work out, don’t give up.** This medication could be one that works for you! But *just in case* it isn’t, I wanted to make sure you know that there are more options. So please don’t give up if that happens (which it might not!).

Also, I saw you said you hadnt been to therapy in a year and a half, and had been on-and-off before then. Do you feel that your therapist is effective and helpful? If therapy isn’t helping, you can always try out a new therapist. Somewhat like medications, not every therapist is right for every person. It’s okay to seek someone new if you’re not getting enough help with your current one.

Personally, quitting meds was the best thing, although I still experience it a little bit when I go back to the doctor or am somewhere in public I’m not familiar with, with the worst of it being very mini panic attacks that last a few seconds when I’m lying down trying to sleep, but I immediately recover from those and I don’t dwell on them. I heard getting all necessary vitamins and having a specific diet can cure/majorly help countless of health problems. So I will try to go that route.

&gt;has anyone here done CBT for panic attacks and anxiety?

I've gone through a lot of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and it was very helpful for depression, anxiety, and PTSD.

&gt;did you find it effective? 

Absolutely. My therapists have provided so much support, refused to give up on me, taught me coping skills to fight depression and anxiety and PTSD, given me a private place to express myself, taught me how to express myself, always given me objective feedback and advice on my issues, helped me keep my head above the water, helped me keep moving forward, challenged me, given me hope, inspired me, validated my struggles, shown me so much compassion, helped me think more objectively, helped me become much healthier, helped me with the grieving process, helped me be able to leave my home, and showed me that my life is worth living.

&gt;if so, how long did that take?

When I first sought help, my therapist tried some cognitive behavioral therapy with me, but it didn't work well right off the bat because I had so many crippling symptoms like inability to concentrate, extreme fatigue, chronic severe headaches, and the list goes on and on. The goals of my first therapist and psychiatrist were to keep me alive and make sure I was stabilized. They absolutely improved the quality of my life, but I needed more intensive help that they couldn't provide since I could only see them once a week or so.

I had to take a medical withdrawal from college, and was admitted to a partial hospitalization program that focused on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Once I was in a better place with my medicine, I could focus more on therapy. I went into the program suicidal and hopeless, but I graduated it feeling amazing, wanting to live, and hopeful. 

I say six weeks, but the program was very intensive, and I was there several days a week for around six or so hours each day. That's a lot of therapy!!! It may take you longer than six weeks, and that's perfectly fine!

Not sure how schools in your country are, but in my case you could not leave or miss class even if you feel like dying because they mark you as ausent and you will probably end up not passing that subject(and sometimes teachers just are straight up jerks who wont let you do anything because they are stressed). I actually fainted once because of low pressure after donating blood in my school and if my teacher wasnt so benevolent they would have probably not cared a bit.

I think you should really focus on making sure the things they already have(like counselors) are actually doing a good job. Some underclassmen had to actually witness a suicide in the middle of class in order for the school to be pressured to admit our counselors didnt care and were doing a horrible job. (I didnt even know we had counselors in the school in the first place, since nobody ever told me nor are there any information to find them. I had a preceptor who, when my friends told her they thought some classmates were bullying me but I was too scared to say anything, straight up told me to just go to them and tell them to stop because it was my problem.)

Our student council seemed to be trying to give the help our school didnt give, so maybe a group of people willing to help or listen would be good too? Idk

He offered to do a more intense procedure consisting of putting a camera down my nose to look further inside my throat to help ease my mind, but said it wasn’t necessary as he didn’t notice anything wrong.

Of course, the thought of the procedure made me even more anxious, so I chose not to.

The odd sensation went away after a few days. Not sure what helped it go away, but it made me feel better that if the feeling went away, it’s likely nothing.

The ENT specialist also told me the throat muscles are hugely affected by anxiety in crazy ways, which also made me feel better.

I hope you start to feel better soon! Trying my best to focus on daily tasks (as hard as it was to ignore that sensation) seemed to help. Anxiety is really the worst thing ever.

smalyaly,,,,[],,,,text,t2_crxmev4,"I can totally relate to this! One class, in particular, when i was in high school had discussions every other day. It was tough for me because not only was I having extreme social anxiety talking in front of people, but i was also having anxiety about talking in front of my classmates who were seniors while i was a sophomore (i was “advanced” or whatteverrr). Eventually, it got to the point where I would not talk at all and i started to fail the class. The one thing that helped me the most was getting a 504 plan. A 504 plan is for those with mild disabilities- like anxiety- that allows for the student to have accommodations.  All i had to do was get my therapist to write a recommendation and work with my school counselor to set up what accommodations i needed. For this particular class, i worked with my teacher to where i could write down my discussion responses instead of speaking them aloud and turn them into her at the end of the hour. Teachers are required by law to allow for your accommodations in the 504 plan (if you go to public school in the US). I would recommend looking into that if your anxiety is really that bad. It isn’t public, only your teachers and parents would know you have this plan and it is completely confidential. It helped me a lot, and actually allowed me to take my own time into developing the confidence to speak aloud in discussions. Learning to speak in public is an important skill to have, but sometimes slower steps are needed. The 504 helped me a lot with taking my time in learning to be more confident in public speaking ",,,,,1548390517,,,eewgtmk,,t3_ajk5wu,,True,t3_ajk5wu,/r/Anxiety/comments/ajk5wu/i_failed_my_english_midterm_because_i_couldnt_talk/eewgtmk/,,1548390518,1,True,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,,,,,,,False,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",,,,,,,,,,,

Yes you're messing with your brain a little but it's not a hallucinagen, you're not going to lose yourself, and if you do feel wrong it's completely ""reversible"", with a small adjustment period. Your brain is already broken or you wouldn't feel the anxiety in the first place, hopefully the medicine will make you feel better.  😁",,,,,1548387043,,,eewctz0,,t3_aji02n,,True,t1_eevp0xm,/r/Anxiety/comments/aji02n/i_was_prescribed_sertraline_today_and_im_really/eewctz0/,,1548387044,2,True,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,,,,,,,False,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",,,,,,,,,,,

Davlau,,,,[],,,,text,t2_d55lq,"I am so sorry this happened to you!  I can completely relate.  First of all, be easier on yourself.  You went prepared you just had too much anxiety to participate.  Is there any chance you could email your teacher and explain that you suffer from anxiety and were not able to participate as much as your preparation would allow you to?  Are you in high school, and if so, is there a guidance counselor you can speak with?  Have you confided in a parent?  I am just hoping there is someone you can turn to.

As far as the other students, I can assure you that nobody thinks about you as much as you fear they do.  People are too busy thinking about themselves.  They may in the moment think you are shy or quietly reserved but not likely anything worse than that.  Some kids who spoke up are home now worrying they sounded stupid, other kids are worried they talked too much.  Students spend way more time thinking about themselves so rest assured there will be no long term impact of this.

My anxiety has made me do/not do things that I squirmed about.  This eventually caused me to go for help and things are much better now.  I am sorry you had a bad experience.  Hold your head high and go in to class.  Smile at anyone who makes eye  contact with you.  The slightest friendliness will outweigh any lingering thoughts of you being quiet.

Liirin,,,,[],,,,text,t2_dc9nv,"Oh, it’s awful. I never connected losing weight with my anxiety, but I absolutely lose weight when I’m stressed. I feel the nausea and make sure to drink an Ensure or smoothie or something, but most of the time I just feel a loss of appetite. If I don’t get some nutritious drinks in me, I just won’t eat for days, and won’t even notice. I had a recent scare where I lost 10 lbs in two weeks, and it was 10 lbs my BMI could not afford. It was the holidays, and I was stressed. 

My husband, bless his heart, will cook as usual, but my palate is completely changed when my anxiety gets bad without me realizing low-key nausea is in play. I’m also apparently stone-cold and don’t communicate my anxiety. Obviously my anxiety makes me doubt that. 

It seems, to him, that I suddenly hate spicy, acidic, and bitter foods (which, normally, I LOVE). I can’t stomach anything creamy. Suddenly I only want very bland or slightly sweet things — basically a child’s ideal diet. Goldfish, Gatorade, fruits, and pasta are the only things I’ll eat. I only just realized with this post — when I was living with my family, I only wanted to eat carbs and cheese. I had a pen pal in school (with a pen pal of the same school a year before), and she gave me a shoebox full of saltines when we exchanged gifts. 

I was hella confused — we’d talked about a whole bunch of things we liked during the year, and we’d shared a lot of common interests. I thought, for a moment, that she was destitutely poor and nicked saltines from the cafeteria over the year and was extremely touched. Nope! She told me that when I visited their school to visit my last pen pal, noticed that I only ate the packaged saltines. I was too anxious and nauseous to eat anything else at a foreign school, but of course a 3d-grader won’t share that. So that’s what she thought I ate, and she wanted to ensure I had a full meal before our shared Field Day. 

It was literally the most thoughtful gift, intentional or not, that I received for the first two decades of my life. Possibly more.

That is a problem for some taking their BP at the office it's not a very accurate way to measure BP. All the experts, including the American Heart Association say to take your BP with these guidelines (which by the way is not really followed at the Doctor office)

* Before taking your blood pressure **don’t smoke or drink caffeinated beverages or exercise within 30 minutes** before taking your blood pressure.
* Make sure you have **5 minutes of quiet rest** before measuring and empty your bladder.
* It’s best to sit in an upright position, back straight and supported like in a dinning room chair and not on a sofa. **Your feet should be flat on the floor** and your legs should not be crossed. Your arm should be supported by a flat surface such as a table or arm rest with your upper arm at heart level.
* Place the cuff directly above the bend of the elbow. You can **check your blood pressure monitor instructions for pictures**.
* It’s important to take your blood pressure readings the **same time every day** such as morning or night and take your readings daily.
* Every time you take your blood pressure readings take 2 or 3 of them one minute apart and **record all your results**.
* If your blood pressure monitor has a built in memory to store your readings you can take it with you to your doctor appointments.
* **Don’t take blood pressure measurements over clothes**.

frsr94,,,,[],,,,text,t2_5avzwz9b,"I've had anxiety for a long time. I don't know what type of anxiety you have, the longevity or the severity of it. For years I struggled mainly with ruminating over things and it impacted my life a lot. I saw many professionals (counsellors, education and clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists, social workers, etc.), I also took anti-depressants (multiple different drugs), the only benefit I noticed from medication was that it helped my depression (made me feel numb and allowed me to get out of a slump), but the medication made the anxiety worse to the point where I was physically shaking and sweating excessively. It made it noticeable to other people, whereas prior to the medication there were no visible signs. 

The best thing that you can do is to sit down with a doctor, maybe even two or three doctors to get different opinions. I'm not against medication, just because anti-depressants didn't fix my anxiety doesn't mean they won't work for you, but coming to an informed and rational decision is the best thing that you can do as opposed to thinking that taking a pill will miraculously cure you. 

I have managed to get on top of my anxiety through meeting others with mental health problems, that benefited me more than sitting with a consultant psychiatrist or any medication. You'll definitely manage to get on top of it as well, whether it's through counselling/therapy, meeting people, medication or a combination of things.

I got invited by a friend but I didn't want to go because they were probably just doing drugs and or drinking and I just wanted to relax and not have a hangover and feel anxious afterwards. 

I ended up feeling lonely and i smoked some weed but had way to much energy drinks and had a panic attack. It was really scary and I was all by myself. Christmas day was okay but again I was lonely and I kind of wanted to have fun on my own, I bought some beers, but I didn't drink for a long time and usually once I start I can't stop, and indeed I just kept going, went to get more and more. When I woke up I had another panic attack because of the hangover. I guess I did it to myself.

I really miss the time I spent with my family, the times when I could just be home and enjoy the nice food, play with the kids, talk to my dad, help him out with stuff and just be sober... For me those things seem to be over, I think that's why I end up doing dumb things. 

I have some friends but I can't really count on them. They just show up whenever they feel like it, also we mostly just get wasted... Friends come and go I've learned so far. Try not to count on them too much.

whoopscoopboop,,,,[],,,,text,t2_3d5r5z7n,"TLDR: in my opinion, all commonly used anxiety medications are quite safe when used *infrequently*. Meditation can be a worthwhile daily treatment without long-term side effects.

I think the closest medications to your criteria are benzodiazepines. In my opinion, the addictive potential is pretty overstated and can be considered less than that of alcohol. It is something to keep in mind, but shouldn’t be a big concern if you don’t have a history of substance abuse...  the bigger concern is memory problems that can come with long term use.

Lyrica can be very helpful for anxiety but carriers a potential for weight gain (but it may not happen to you) and it carriers a similar risk for memory problems and habit formation as benzodiazepines.

All medications have side effects. Due to the nature of anxiety meds, most of them can cause memory and cognition problems with long-term use. 

I think that when taken infrequently (weekly or less), most anxiety medications can be very safe and helpful. 

My preferred treatment is meditation daily and medication when things get too overwhelming.",,,,,1577416108,,,fc4gnjk,False,t3_eg3tgg,,True,t3_eg3tgg,/r/Anxiety/comments/eg3tgg/medication_suggestions_is_there_a_drug_that/fc4gnjk/,,1577416110,1,True,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,,,,,,,False,{},,[],False,0.0,,[],[],,False,,

-	Go to therapy. Go. To. Therapy. I wish I would have done this earlier. It helped so much to have a safe space to cry over it and process everything on a regular basis. 
-	Find a hobby. It can be anything. I chose walking my dogs everyday. 
-	r/breakups was really helpful for me. I found a community there and communicated with a few people going through the same things on WhatsApp for awhile. It was nice to feel understood.

On top of that most people's families are dysfunctional, I was speaking to someone recently whose family has a cultural/religious divide meaning that he prefers to spend Christmas on his own as opposed to being around them (they don't approve of his girlfriend because of her skin colour \[she's white\] and also because he left a high-paid job in investment banking to become a paramedic and saves lives \[his family are deeply ashamed that he moved into career where he earns less money\]). 

That is just one example, but I know many people who dread this time of year. Even people who have good relationships with their family find it incredibly difficult. If you feel that being around them for so long is causing your mental health to suffer then go back to your own house, at the end of the day all you need to say if that you've not been feeling very well and have a stomach bug or be honest and explain it's too much.

hispeedzintarwebz,,,,[],,,,text,t2_5nft1,"I know your post was mainly about downvotes - but this goes for responses, trolling, etc. across the board:

One of the greatest things the internet has to offer is anonymity.  Anonymity to alert the world to bad news that would get someone persecuted.  Anonymity to do something great and not take the credit.  Anonymity that allows someone to contribute to something - code, a discussion, anything - and a ten year old kid in Malaysia will hold the same sway as if Bill Gates contributed it.

That is a good thing.  A very good thing.  And I for one hope that we never lose that.

But there are downsides.  When you don’t have to look someone in the face, you can be mean.  You can be a troll.  You can say nasty, hurtful things.  You can be a faceless entity being a real piece of shit to another faceless entity, and there’s no consequences.

In my opinion, the former is worth the latter.  If we lose anonymity on the internet, we lose a lot of the democratization it offers.  But is also means we have to put the phone (or laptop or keyboard or tablet) down at times, take a deep breath, and remember it doesn’t matter.  People are assholes sometimes - sometimes a lot of people are assholes a lot of the time - but they’re people lashing out because they can, and because there’s no consequences for them.  Try to remember that, and that they don’t matter.  I honestly believe - and this sub (which I recently discovered) affirms this for me - that people are generally good.  We see on the news the people stealing and killing and buying up all the toilet paper - for every one of those there’s a hundred people being kind.  Helping others.  It doesn’t sell clicks - it doesn’t bump ratings - but society wouldn’t work as well as it does if that weren’t the case.

So in short - Fuck the haters.  You be you.  Sometimes you’ll get downvoted.  Sometimes people will really hate what you have to say.  That’s okay.

Many people can be misdiagnosed and taking this medication on your self diagnosis is not only not okay but also terribly dangerous. You are most probably making your anxiety and depression worse to the point of felling suicidal.

You need to go to a doctor and let them know what's going on. They will most definitely figure out whether or not you are addicted to the Effexor (venlafaxine) or just suffering severe side effects. I would also peruse this website for information about the misuse of venlafaxine. Look at their list of symptoms and see if that sounds like what you are struggling with.

He says, ""You shouldn't buy that, you should buy something else.""

You say, ""Maybe next time I have money I can do that but this is what I've decided to buy right now.""

Now you can talk to him about him til you are blue in the face, ""That really makes me feel bad when you talk like that."" But considering what you've said about both his and your mental illnesses, it sounds like you guys are dealing with a lot already. By simply acknowledging what he said but also not giving into it, you set a precedent. He doesn't get to dictate what you do with your money.

If he keeps talking about it, you turn around and say, ""I have already told you this is what I'm going to buy. It is very stressful and hurtful when you keep telling me what a bad idea it is and it makes me feel like you don't think I can handle my money."" (Or something like that, depending on your actual feelings lol)

Obviously those of us with anxiety have a hard time thinking clearly in the moment. Do not respond right away to negativity, give yourself a minute, 60 seconds to formulate a response, if you need longer take longer. If you can't think of what to say then you don't say anything until you do. That way it doesn't escalate right away.

You should NOT let it go and forget about it. Even if it takes you ten minutes to form a response, you go find him and tell him. Sometimes this is good too because you might also explain that it took you so long to say something because it hurts when he says things like that.

Venlafaxine is (usually) meant to be a daily pill that you take once. Once it is in your system steadily it tends to work by stabling the chemicals in your brain that usually cause you to stress and panic.

By constantly switching doses and taking them sometimes this way and that, you could be confusing your body into thinking it needs more when it really doesn't. Basically you can become addicted. If you are under the care of a Doctor, you should definitely talk with him/her about you possibly having become addicted to Venlafaxine.

This can be a dangerous slope and it is not your fault. But taking some in the morning and some at night or just whenever you feel anxious is the exact thing you should not do.

I make sure to go to the bathroom right before attempting to go to sleep.

If it's a lost cause, I take a short bath to break the tedium of trying to sleep and help relax.

Chamomile tea or cocoa mint tea can help right before bed.

If you do nothing else. If your house is a wreck and your clothes haven't been washed in a week and you haven't showered in three days. Even if you feel like there is no point to rolling out of bed in the morning, much less talk to someone. You push all that to the side and you start calling places.

You are going to be okay. Take deep breaths and find a place to lay down. If you are not at home, find a way to get to your car and lay the seat back. 

Talk to yourself. Yes it's a little crazy but reassure yourself that you are not dying and the pain you are feeling will get much better as you come down from the panic.

Try to identify if anything triggered the panic attack. If there was a trigger, get away from it and take slow deep breaths. Seriously I can't stress enough, breath.

Three By Three breathing. Count to three as you breathe in and control your exhale so that it takes three seconds to breathe out as well.

Don't give in to any impulsiveness right now. I binge eat in the wake of a panic attack.

Write down everything you are feeling. (This doesn't work for everyone but it's worth a shot!) Regardless of how it sounds, if ya rude, selfish, hateful, write it down. You can throw it away later or keep it. Then read it back and know that these are your feelings. They aren't made up for attention. They aren't excuses. They are legitimate and valid. 

Remind yourself of the people that care about you (They're out there. If you think there's just nobody, I care about you. See? Someone cares about you!) Know that you are loved and worthy of that love. You are an amazing individual that fights to keep your head above the doubt and the fear that attacks you every day.

You are a warrior. You are a badass. And you are going to be okay!

It will pass and you will come out on the other side, exhausted, but alive, and loved.

While I do still have anxiety, it has taken some time for this to not be the main issue every evening any more. Routine has really helped my anxiety as well as meds. Self care every evening, including setting aside my clothes and making a to do list for the next day (and then mentally letting go of tomorrow knowing that I’ve done what I can to be prepared) helps as well. 

Maybe plan something to look forward to every evening. Your favorite meal one day, a good book the next, a nice long bath toward the end of the week to help you relax, etc. ",True,,,0.0,1530233215,,0.0,e1h0o53,False,t3_8uo7zo,1.0,True,t3_8uo7zo,/r/Anxiety/comments/8uo7zo/anxiety_about_going_to_work_every_day/e1h0o53/,6546.0,1533044602,2,True,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,,public,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,markdown

While I believe substance abuse and anxiety disorders are often comorbid, and some substances can cause mental health issues, I don't think the majority of people get anxiety from abusing drugs and alcohol. Typically, substance abuse is an attempt to self-medicate for those issues. The article above, and a few others I glanced at, put the estimation of substance abuse-caused anxiety at around 20%.   


Personally, I am an alcoholic and have abused drugs in the past as well. These things did not cause my anxiety, though they likely made it worse.

Hegemonee,1415326835.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_j8nzc,"Hey heres a couple things I've used to help with this situation. I hope you're open to these suggestions! Let me know if you weren't looking for straight up advice tho. 

1. One way to feel less anxious about embarrassing things in the past is to realize that people most likely don't remember the event. We are so caught up in our own heads, and we should remind ourself that other people are caught up in their lives. They probably overlooked what you did, as they are worrying about themselves. If you want to go even further, its almost selfish to think that everyone's paying attention to you. It takes a heightened ego to think youre hte center of everyone's attention. This helps put things in perspective as, I imagine, you are not an egomaniac and you are not selfish in that regard. 
2. Realize that if there were 100 copies of you, that probably 95 of the ""You's"" would have done THE EXACT SAME THING IN THAT SITUATION. You cant really beat yourself up for it, because you would have done the same thing if it came up.
3. I call this ""sabotaging bad thoughts"". If these old memories cause you to feel bad, lets fight back. We can fight back by forcing ourself to feel happy/excited the next time you have this wave of bad feelings come. So next time you have a bad memory come up, FORCE yourself to smile, and say a forced sentence like ""wow, im really glad that happened, it helped form who I am today, I am a stronger person because of it. I dont care if you dont believe it, i just want to start undermining the bad feelings. I want to gain some control over them. Another way is to play some music you really love and venture into old memories, in order to rewire them/ take away their power. 
4. This one is just a saying from Paul Gilmartin and its one of my favorites. He basically says ""You cant beat yourself into a better version of you"". I love it. So if youve been beating yourself up for these past days, months and years, lets try something new. Lets try something different. And lets realize that beating yourself up is simply ineffective.

There's not much help strangers can give unfortunatly, as everyone is different and often has different reasons for dealing with anxiety and panic attacks such as you described. Mines were mild compared to yours, but it still gives me the goosebumps thinking back on it.

I like your writting, it's very organized compared to mine (my brain is all over the place :p). You are seeking help and understanding for what is happening to you and I think that is admirable.

Your seem to have a lot on your mind. It's understandable, that's a lot to take in at once, a lot to reflect on, and it might take some time to do so. It took me a couple years, but of course I still have many ups and downs even if I'm leagues away from where I was.

Meanwhile, as you said yourself, the symptoms might linger for a while and come and go. So you treat yourself well and rest your body and your mind as much as you can while you digest all those thoughts you have. Having other people to share them with helps a lot, even if those are strangers on the internet. Do what you have to even if it seems silly or weird.

I would look into some anti anxiety medications, zoloft has been a godsend for me, and i saw you mentioned pot as well..make sure you are smoking indica and NOT sativa cause indica is a full body high and sativa is a head high but its more prone to cause anxiety/paranoia.

beencouraged,1518164818.0,,,,,,,,t2_30d0nkg,"Oh dang, hang in there! I hated the SAT but I actually got a great score by doing the practice tests obsessively. They really are a necessary evil. 

The math section was a bunch of trick questions back when I did it. I thought if I applied my weak textbook skills I could do it. Turns out the practice questions were a lot different and I was very glad I did them.
I actually wish I had practiced the math section *more* because it was so different than my regular math and I think not actually that hard. 

I went to a private school that let us mix and match subject scores from multiple tests, so I took the SAT three times. 
On my last go I put ALL my energy into doing the math sections as quickly as possible because I always ran out of time.
My final math score was high enough to wave my GenEd math class. My major didn’t require any more math. 

My parents used to make fun of me for taking forever at math. Hours per day. 
If I can do it, you can too. It’s all in those practice tests. Take a deep breath and stick with ‘em! 

It helped me to focus on which kinds of questions I got wrong and practice those. If they’re all wrong then you know you just need to keep doing them until they’re memorized. Once you’re familiar with the process it’s going to be easier to do under the timer.

cherry_pips,1515214319.0,,,,,,,,t2_qxpt8ln,"I also get intrusive thoughts and ruminations. They have definitely gotten worse with age although I can remember them starting when I was under 10. 
OCD has been tossed around for me a few times but never formally diagnosed. My problem is that once I get the thought, I feel as though I have to act on it or everything around me will explode. Luckily, very few of my thoughts are violent and when they are, they’re usually around hurting myself. 
I’m able to view the random ones (what if I stab him, drop this baby, etc) with a bit of humour and they pass quickly. 
I’ll tell you what I’ve been told by various health professionals over the years but full disclosure-I don’t do any of these things myself and if I’ve tried, I’ve given up very quickly. But hey, maybe you’ll have more luck!

Breathing-when a thought occurs take five breaths in and out. The in doesn’t matter, but focus on every millisecond of the out.

Grounding-Focus your attention immediately on what you can hear, then smell, then taste, then see, then feel. Really stretch out each sensation.

Stop sign (or wet cement)- imagine a big red stop sign popping up in front of the thought and shout inside your head “stop!”. I lied earlier-I remembered this did work for me for awhile but then the thoughts “broke through” so I started imagining a paint can pouring black paint over the thoughts. Then they broke through that so I changed it to cement! Tbh I sill use this technique if I’m ruminating myself into insomnia. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this. I hope you can find something to help.

On the other hand. Avoiding the problem is never a good idea when it comes to treating anxiety. As many anxiety problems, facing your fear is often one of the best solutions.

I have the same problem as you. Hate presenting in front of class. But things you can do to train is to be more active in class, or as my teacher did, not long ago she asked me to take notes on the board in front of class. Lasted for about an hour. Exercise like these helps a lot.

ineedanewphonepls,,,,,,,,,,"I've been taken 80 mg propranolol slow release daily for almost 2 years now. I was prescribed it for panic attacks in 2016, and have maintained the same dosage all that time. Before I started taking propranolol, I was having panic attacks daily, sometimes many times a day. I couldn't sit through a lecture without having a panic attack. I couldn't sit my exams without having one. I couldn't go to the gym without having one. I could go on and on. Propranolol has given me my life back, and allowed me to work on the underlying anxiety.

You will still feel anxious in your mind, but your body will be calm/only slightly on edge. This alone helps stop that feedback loop like: anxious thoughts -&gt; body responds with adrenaline -&gt; leads to more anxious thoughts -&gt; body responds more -&gt; and so on. I have just finished university, and I honestly don't know if I would have managed it without propranolol. The other options I was offered were benzos and anti-depressants, neither of which I like the idea of. With propranolol your mind won't be affected at all, just your body, which is something that is quite beneficial.

In terms of side effects, my main side effects were during the first week. For the first week or so I was completely wrecked tired. It wasn't a sleepy tired, I was just fatigued constantly, it felt like I had been up for 48 hours (it was horrible). This went away after that first week. Apparently most people don't get this side effect at all, and if you are just taking it at night in a low dose you probably won't. An ongoing side effect you will notice is that you probably won't have as much stamina as you used to. This only really matters if you are into running/cycling/etc, you might notice you have maybe 10-20% (rough estimations based on experience) less stamina. One of the most annoying things about propranolol is that it can disturb sleep. This is something that over time I have experienced less, but initially when I started taking propranolol it was quite noticeable. It was mainly just waking up many times throughout the night. 

The main point is that I have never had a panic attack while taking propranolol. Not one. That is coming from having multiple attacks most days, which were getting worse and worse. Propranolol stopped them completely. During the time I've been taking it, I've dealt with the most challenging situations of my life to date, and still been able to avoid panic attacks thanks to propranolol. You will still feel anxiety, but propranolol will give you some breathing space so that you can work on that anxiety without feeling consumed by it. 

This probably reads like a paid ad for propranolol, I promise it's not haha. I just want to get across to you the profound difference propranolol can make to your life. I hope the night time panic attacks stop. They are the worst in my opinion, and I'm lucky enough to only ever have had a few.

he-mancheetah,1458083573.0,,,,,,,,t2_wf1fp,"I recently found a new job after a few years of looking. I had a job still, but I was underemployed and deeply unhappy, for many reasons. I knew I had to get out, and I was fearful I never would. 

As an anxiety sufferer, I had those feelings about going on interviews at first. I thought interviewers would laugh right in my face. Who do you think you are? Trying to work here at our company, join our team, become a valuable employee? HA! As if!

What helped me, and the advice I have for you, is to kind of treat this like dating...? I know that sounds weird, but hear me out. You’ve sent in your resume, your “profile”, if you will, and they have a general idea of the person they’ll be meeting. So you go, and you be your best, most professional self. Don’t get too hung up on whether or not you get the job (which sounds much much easier than it is, I know), just concentrate on being a real person and cranking that confidence level up to 10, even if you don’t feel it. Just fake it. Smile. Be pleasant. Show your own interest in the company by noting things about the company that you appreciate. For instance, this company I just started working for does a lot of charity work. It’s all right there on their website! So I mentioned how amazing I think it is that they do that, and I love the idea of not only having a job, but being part of a company and culture that cares about the community. If you can make a little benign joke off the cuff, that can go a long way also. Remember, this isn’t a summit on war crimes in the Gaza Strip, they just want to hire someone who can do the job, be professional, and who will be able to get along with everyone. It is a lottery, yes, but it’s one you can win.

Lastly, it’s hard not to feel like you’re being judged and scrutinized in an interview. You are. But apart from knowing you can do the job, they want someone who also WANTS to work there, aside from the money. They want to see if they can embark on a “relationship” with you. Instead of getting a job, your goal is to show yourself off a bit and show them how much they want that relationship with you. 

I don’t know if this will help you. I hope it does. It helped me to tweak my perception of what a job interview actually is by reminding myself that interviewers are just people like you and me, and they want someone they want to work with that can also do the job. Talking to strangers is a tough thing for a lot of people, sometimes it can help to change the situation in your head a little bit.

A robbery of any kind is a violation but a personal attack like this is worse, I think, than a break-in while you're away from home because your life could be in danger.  I'd try to see a therapist or someone similar to talk to, this kind of event is terrible and unexpected and most of us have no experience with how to deal with it.


As for the revenge factor, I wouldn't worry about it.  They probably saw you as a relatively easy target (especially when outnumbered) and decided to harass you.  Planning some sort of revenge would take too much effort for essentially zero payoff -- the only thing it would lead to is more trouble for them.  Don't bother changing the way you go to work or anything like that.  They aren't coming after you.


That said, be sure to file a police report.  Give them detailed descriptions of the assailants and what happened.  The police will tell you to call 911 if you see them again and remember that the muggers DO NOT need to do anything to you for the police to respond -- they have ALREADY committed a crime with you as the victim.

DrMonaG,,,,,,Verified | Licensed Psychologist,,,,"I see you! :) you aren’t alone with this frustrating symptom of anxiety: indecisiveness. Anxiety makes it hard to think straight in the first place but because you’re already in life or death mode, any small decision is seen through that set of eyes (for more on this topic, see my other responses on fight, flight, freeze mode). It’s no longer, “what am I craving for dinner?” and more, “if I don’t pick the right dinner then everything will be ruined.” Talking with a counselor about that pattern and identifying ways to break the loop of anxiety is definitely worth considering. I once worked with a client who got stuck in indecisiveness because, it turns out, he believed he was incapable of making good decisions in life. That everything he did always ended badly. We did a lot of work around that but once he was ready to try something different, we practiced making little decisions like: red shirt or blue shirt to wear today? Slowly he proved to himself that he’s great at making decisions and that they don’t always end badly. And when and if they do, he was able to make other decisions to right the wrongs. That unraveled the chain of anxiety. Not sure if that’s what you’re struggling with but that’s where counseling can be helpful—figuring out the heart of the anxiety so that you can uncover the solution that is needed to dissolve it.

nym1899,1471576497.0,,,,,,,,t2_10op17,"32/m here. I started Zoloft at 15 and at the height of it was taking 250 mg. I was able to drop from 250 to 200 without any issues, but it took a few tries for me to get from 200 to 100 (my current dose). This is what I learned from my experience; I hesitate to use the word “recommend,” as everyone’s brain chemistry is different. 

1. Go slow. It really does take the brain time to adjust, especially after such prolonged use.

2. Have someone you can confide in during your weaning-off phase. Obviously a doctor is best but not always practical. I had a friend whom I told, “I’m gonna be slowly tapering off this drug and I’m not 100 percent sure how it’ll affect me. I’d be really grateful if you could check in/entertain my conversations about it.” He did, and it made me feel like I had a lifeline in case shit got dicey.

3. Bump up your Omega 3s (fish oil) and exercise.  Even if it’s just a few times a week. You want to get the blood flowing and endorphins pumping. 

4. Keep a journal of how you feel. It’ll help you track progress and can be therapeutic in and of itself.

5. Refrain from eating shit and drinking alcohol. Even if that’s your MO throughout the year, do your best to keep your diet clean during this phase. Healthy fats are your friend. 

6. Decide how much shitty feeling you can tolerate. The first time I tried to wean off, I threw in the towel at the first flu-like symptoms. This last time, I decided to stick with it for a few days and supplement with Benadryl. The first day sucked. The second day sucked harder. But then the clouds began to clear. 

7. It’s not a failure if you go back to your previous dose. It took me a few times before it clicked, mostly because I didn’t follow numbers 2-6. Still, don’t put yourself in a position where you’re miserable just because you want to be off the drug.

noodlelaughter,1412137121.0,,,,,,,,t2_ing92,"Hello! I'm just going to give a little background before I talk about what worked for me! So when I was 18 I decided it would be a great idea to try magic mushrooms. I got hppd (hallucinating persisting perception disorder) from that first and only time and alone with that came awful depersonalization. I remember feeling like I wasn't really myself for months, I would rub my hands together and they just wouldn't feel like mine, and this would cause panic. Soon after the hppd kicked off I decided a therapist would be important and went to talk about my drug induced condition since I was waking up with panic attacks every night. 

She suggested breathing exercises, and activities that give you something to feel. I got pretty into bike riding during this time as focusing on my feet on the pedals and the wind on my face really seemed to help. Sometimes when the depersonalization got me in more of a panicked state I would take a shower changing the temperature from hot to cold and breathing deep and slow. Breathing exercises in general proved to be very worthwhile. For some reason at night time my depersonalization was significantly worse when I was laying on my side. I have no idea if that's normal, my therapist thought it was extremely interesting but couldn't figure it out either.  Try to make sure you're getting enough sleep in general as well. For me sleep seems to play a huge role in my anxiety. I've heard a lot of people say that diet can play a role, not something I've ever noticed personally but it could be worth trying.

The control thing sounds more like generalized anxiety as well. I know I personally have control issues and have also had the existential crisis you described so it's certainly not abnormal. If you've had suicidal thoughts I would consider opening up about that with someone you trust. I found that when I figured out how to deal with depression issues my anxiety issues seemed to get better as well. 

Just try to find activities that you can focus on a feeling, you're not going crazy and it will pass! It might be helpful for you to go talk to someone about it as well! 3 years later I still notice a bit of depersonalization when I'm over tired or dehydrated but other than that I'm much better. Stay focused, sleep, eat well and start figuring out what works for you!

dalilajl,,,,,,Verified | Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist,,,,"Hi Mixedasianchild, 
It's not uncommon to feel tightness in your throat. Anxiety causes many physical symptoms that are different for different people. The potential acid and food coming up may be concerning, and I would suggest you check with your doctor. 

The general advice is to practice activities that reduce overall anxiety during these moments and when you are feeling well. 

When you are feeling these physical symptoms, moving your body can be helpful. As you feel like throwing up, I don't imagine you can do some vigorous activity, but perhaps moving in your seat, feeling your bottom on the chair. planting your feet firmly on the ground, maybe getting up, stomping your feet on the ground, breathing techniques. rubbing your shoulders, thighs, belly, or whatever feels comfortable. Find some ways in which it feels comfortable to be in your body. 

In general, I recommend increasing your self-care by doing meditation, hiking, walking, socializing, eating good food, etc. Hope this helps.

DrMonaG,,,,,,Verified | Licensed Psychologist,,,,"Yes, depersonalization/derealization is more common than you might think. It’s not a coping strategy in the way we typically think of coping. In other words, it’s not something you’re intentionally doing on purpose. But it sometimes comes on in response to severe, chronic anxiety and also in response to trauma, intense pain, or in moments of crisis. It’s helpful to understand that at the core, our body just wants us alive &amp; happy. Our natural instinct is to move away from pain, harm, and danger. That’s what our body is designed to do. It’s believed that sometimes the anxiety, which is living in constant fear &amp; sense of danger, is so taxing that the brain will resort to depersonalization/derealization to create distance and get away from the constant pain. Problem with this is that the experience of depersonalization/derealization is super scary and can  cause more fear and anxiety, which perpetuates the depersonalization/derealization. It’s like the other vicious cycles of anxiety. The goal of counseling is to interrupt the loop and decrease the anxiety to prevent getting back into depersonalization/derealization. Hope that helps!

DrMonaG,,,,,,Verified | Licensed Psychologist,,,,"I can hear just how much it kills you to watch your wife suffer with anxiety and feel like you can’t do anything to fix it. It’s clear how profoundly you love her and want her to be happy. You’re a wonderful partner for taking the time to ask this question in an effort to try and find a solution. I’ll do my best to help. Please feel free to ask follow up questions if needed. 

I see why you’d be concerned about her reaction to talking to her about counseling since it seems like she has a complicated relationship with dad and maybe complicated feelings about getting help from a mental health professional. And you’re right, you can’t be her psychologist. What’s going on with her is beyond anything you can personally do to treat the anxiety. 

Your story makes me curious though if the two of you have ever talked about the anxiety at all. Sometimes couples both acknowledge the elephant in the room but no one has ever said the words “anxiety” or “this is a problem” out loud. If this sounds like you two, I recommend you start there. As in, just talk to her about what you’ve noticed, what concerns you, how it makes you feel. You don’t ever have to mention counseling. But these types of conversations eventually lead to: well, what are we going to do to fix this? The answer might be “let’s try counseling” or it might be “I’m quitting my job because I hate flying.” Either way it’s moving from living with the status quo to doing something...anything...towards positive change. The other thing to consider is for you to go to counseling. This can have two helpful outcomes: 1) you get support with this because it’s clearly stressful for you too, and 2) you lead by example. Seeing you have a good experience in counseling can possibly motivate her and give her the courage to go too. All the best to the both of you!

I suffer from anxiety and work with mentally I'll adults. From these experiences I can tell you these things don't go away on their own. People that reduce their anxiety or symptoms of their mental illnesses are the ones that put work in. The same way you build muscle by working out, you build coping skills by doing the work. That's being open in therapy and trying out techniques discussed. That's taking medication as prescribed and telling your psychiatrist what's working and what isn't. It's being kind to yourself, because even with progress, there will be times you slip. The trick is not allowing yourself to fall apart completely, because that makes the climb that much harder. Commit to your mental health and you will feel the progress. Life is fucking wonderful and anxiety is merely your brain tricking you into thinking every day problems are tragedies - that danger is around every corner. It's bullshit. Eventually something you hear or experience will trigger something and it will all come together. Until then, make it your obsession.

3. Even in the darkest nights, I will be here with you to help you find the light at the end of the tunnel.

4. Fear is like a wave in the ocean at first it feels all-consuming and like you can hardly breathe but like all waves they come and go with enough time and bravery the storm will pass.

5. Remember, you are supported I love/care about you if you are feeling lonely or anxious ask for a hug or a kiss on the head i won't mind.

6. Remember, anxiety does not define who you are. you have anxiety that does not mean anxiety has you. 

That's all I got for now if I think of any more ill pm you. edit or adjust any one of them as you see fit. Sorry if the grammar or formatting is wonky.

I am very new to anxiety, joining the community this week. Over the past couple months, I had a few urgent care visits for unexplained bouts of breathlessness and shivering. No physical problem was found and they gave me some information about anxiety. A few days ago, I had my worst yet complete with chest pressure and swallowing/lump in throat/mortal thoughts - I haven't felt quite right since. 


What I don't understand most is how I do not feel emotionally anxious whatsoever - I had always assumed a panic attack is brought on by escalating, conscious, fretful-turning-to-doomsday thoughts that trigger a physical flight or fight response. I consider myself happy with a busy and enjoyable life. I'm still learning and know my limits, but eagerly pursue ambitious tasks at work. I'm generally healthy with a big loving family. If the routine stressors brought on by some of these undertakings (school, work, wedding, family dynamics) are to blame, is changing these interests/relationships part of the treatments? These panic attacks coincide with a recent decline in PTSD symptoms from an experience 3 years ago - can anxiety attacks be 'redirected' stressors from that previous rumination? Does CBT help if I don't have apparent triggers or triggering thoughts?

commandermel,1484781783.0,,,,,,,,t2_14kfyj,"Okay so about 4 weeks ago I was prescribed my first SSRI by an urgent care. I never thought I has ""anxious enough"", much like you. He prescribed 20 mg of Celexa, which was not the SSRI for me. The first 2 weeks I went through what is commonly referred to as ""seratonin"" flu. I had severe nausea and loss of appetite along with a head cold symptoms. It was awful, but you have to stick through it. My mood improved a bit but then I started having  hypomanic spells. I also had an increase in anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I ended up in the psych ward for give days because it got so bad but I kept telling myself it was just the adjustment period and I would level out soon. They transferred me over to Zoloft and I feel immensely better. Have a few adjustment period symptoms here and there as i transition off one pill and to another (headaches and  VERY mild occasional nausea) but for the most part I'm very happy. 

Moral of this story is keep track of your mood and keep in contact with your doc during the first 3-4 weeks. After that time, the full therapeutic effect of the drug should be happening. Also, if you're on Celexa, don't let my experience scare you away from it or SSRIs in general. Each SSRI is different and everyone reacts differently to them.

PudgeKittyIsMyHero,1523019069.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_15haxjc1,"Yes. I am fighting with it as I type this. Try meditation. Focus on your toes, really feeling every body part on up until you get to the top of your head. Go slow. You'll get distracted. Take a few deep breaths. The goal isn't enlightenment, but to bring your anxiety levels down just a little bit or a lot. Either way, it's a victory. And if you don't finish or if it doesn't work, you can try it again or not--just don't beat yourself up about it. It's what works for you. Give this method a try every morning and night for a week. It ends up helping me.

  


Also, learn about the physical responses to stress. Don't focus on WHAT is making you stressed. Rumination is really bad for anxiety (but if you end up ruminating, don't beat yourself up for it either--distract yourself with a manual task like cleaning or studying instead). Focus on why you're feeling this way. Anxiety comes from the flight or fight response. Anger is fight, anxiety is fear. You're afraid of something and your body is wanting you to run from it. Figure out what you're afraid of. Figure out ways to solve it. If you can't figure out a practical and quick way to absolve this worry, then put your energy into something else productive like cleaning or exercising. Physical activity actually does help you run some of the anxiety out. It releases endorphins, and if you see progress in something it releases dopamine.

I finally went on a daily med for my chronic anxiety. 
I spent 3 weeks fretting over taking medication. 3 weeks fretting about the side effects, whether or not it would “change me”, and fretting about fretting that I was fretting. 

I started mine during a winter break I had off from work. 

I spent the first 2 weeks concerned with every single side effect. And honestly I didn’t have very many. It’s just that during that 2 weeks everything seemed amplified because I was in such a bad state of anxiety. 

Be open and honest with your doctor. I was, I told him I was terrified of the side effects. He started me on an extremely low dose and I slowly ramped up. 
After the middle of my 4th week I was like wha...I can sleep, I can eat and I’m not chewing my nails down until they bled. 

I made sure during the first few weeks I was active. I walked every day. I tried to be as social as possible. I drew, painted, did a ton of crafts, anything I could do to distract me from side effects. 
Even though I wasn’t eating a lot, I made myself eat super healthy during that first month. No drinking either. 

It all worked. Surrounding myself with anything that made me happy worked. 

Also making a good connection with your doctors helps too. 
We made a plan to check in weekly by phone or email. Making that connection helped tremendously. 

One thing to note. They won’t force you to take meds if you don’t want to. My doctor left that door open to me. Hopefully your doctor will leave that door open too. 

After 3 weeks of fretting about the side effects, no sleep and dropping 15 lbs, I knew it was time and I was ready. 

I was diagnosed in 2011 with panic disorder and GAD. I had a very specific incident that triggered it. 
I went on daily meds in December of 2017. 
The meds didn’t change me, the side effects ended up being super mild and I have my life back.

Fear has a funny way of making us feel like we have to listen to it all the time. Even if you are having deadly symptoms what would you do? I know this questions suck, but what would you change if you really thought you were going to have a heart attack?

My therapist gave me this, and it can be life changing. It can be tedious to look through, so just doing 5 or 10 a day.

&gt; I feel like everyone just laughs about the fact that I’m losing control over my life.

I hope not, and I think most likely not because that is a high level of sadism. I don't think they actively laugh at your life. I think they might laugh at certain behaviors you may have, but not your life overall. Please don't give into the hatred that would cause.

&gt; Everyone I tell gets uncomfortable and don’t respond.

Unfortunately we live in a shitty society. I am sorry that is the case.

&gt; My family is supportive but they don’t know how to help. 

My family is the same way they want to help, and they don't know exactly how besides a few things every once in a while.

Oh yeah, outdoor exercise is generally better for mental health than indoor exercise.

There is some benefits to a gym if one wants to lift heavy weights or has disabilities that makes it so they need to rely on machines though.

If you have never suffered from anxiety I would highly recommend reading through this sub or search on the internet to get to know some of the symptoms and signs of all the different types of anxiety. If she wants to share her diagnosis or type of anxiety you can put further research in.
Maybe try and ask her what helps her with calming down if she is feeling anxious so you are prepared in the future.

As for skipping therapy - I'm sure your therapist is aware already. My best advice would to call them and tell them how you are feeling about the whole situation and explain that you believe you will have a hard time feeling safe while in group. That's what they are there for and maybe they can help you to work through this horrible experience.

I hope you find a way to deal with this, too! Since I wrote this post, I met up with my therapist and talked about this. (To give some context, I still haven't gotten any diagnoses or anything, she isn't a psychiatrist and works more as a personal development therapist etc., but so far talking to her has been tremendously helpful to me!!!)

Basically I described to her the same thing that I wrote in this post, about the anger washing over me and me having a hard time calming down. I asked her if this doesn't sound like some unhealthy thing. She told me that maybe it sounds a tad strong at the minute, but anger as such, as a moderate emotion, is in itself healthy, because if a person can get angry, it means that this person knows what they want and/or need. (After this she said that, for example, with depression a person just doesn't care about many things anymore and that's less healthy than to have some angry feelings about stuff.) She told me that, knowing my character - I've been a very very sensitive person my whole life - maybe it just so happens that at some periods of life my emotions get stronger than what I'd like them to be. I just need to find ways to calm those emotions in a healthy way.

She told me that every time I start feeling anger, if it bothers me, I can:

1) Try to stop whatever I'm doing for a moment and breathe. She suggested just going inside a quiet room, for example the bathroom and breathing, even if that seems like the last thing that I want to do, because breathing anyway helps with calming down the nervous system. She said that I can even try breathing with a sound, like, while breathing out, make a ""ssss"" or ""fffff"" sound. Not sure why the sounds would help, but I feel like that might help with feeling less serious. :D

2) Ask myself ""Why am I angry?"" - ""Is it because I'm stressed and struggle to get work done? Is it because some kind of a need of mine is not taken care of? Am I hungry or sleepy?"" - basically, accepting the emotion and trying to figure out if there is any productive way how I can help myself.

3) Do something physical, the best - some exercises or work with hands. Do squats. Squeeze/knead something, like modeling clay or dough, or smth like that. Something that I can take the anger out on in a non-destructive way.

Of course, I don't know what's the underlying issue in your case and so have no idea if any of these tips might be a solution to you, but I thought I'd share - maybe they do happen to help :)

Then about two months ago, I moved six hours away with my wife.. not quite across country but still pretty far you know? after the newness and excitement wore off.. I got MAD anxiety about being in a new place. it was hard for a bit. It’s still sometimes hard now. But after a few weeks, it started to go back down again. I’m still more anxious than I was back home but it’s been easier for me to handle.

So I guess what I’m trying to say is.. I know where you are coming from because my own story shares similar elements. I actually posted here not too long ago for the exact reason you did. There’s a pretty good chance I deleted it though. But before I did, someone here (thank you if you see this) gave me really great advice so I’m gonna try and relay that to you. It takes time to adjust to such a big life change. It makes sense that you’d react with anxiety. Just try and do the things you know have helped your anxiety in the past and make sure you’re being open about your struggles, whether that’s with your boyfriend or a therapist (if possible) or a family member but for best results, probably all three.

VexedCoffee,1344732146.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_8n1xz,"I only developed anxiety this year but it took a few months for me to figure it out.

It began with an abscessed tooth in which I started thinking about someone I knew who ended up with a brain infection due to a root canal gone bad. I remember my whole body feeling ""off"" and just like something wasn't right. I'd constantly have thoughts about bacteria running amuck in my body and infecting my brain or my heart.

Infection eventually went down with my antibiotics and I put the experience behind me. Then a couple months later I start feeling a very minor but constant pain in my testicles. After an ultrasound and visit with the urologist I'm told that there is absolutely nothing wrong with me. So I put it behind me and usually only feel that slight pain during stressful times but just ignore it.

Finally, a month or so after that I get a cold. Everything is fine for about 7 days. Just resting at home and watching netflix. But then I decide to take some cold medicine I'd never taken before. Right away my heartbeat seems to elevate. I feel like I've taken a caffeine pill or something but just plan on sleeping it off. Go to sleep just fine but when I wake up in the middle of the night to go pee I suddenly find myself in a full blown panic attack. 

After that I go to the nurse practitioner and she seems a bit worried. I cry that evening as the sense of dread just sticks around. The uneasiness, the chest pain, the lightheadedness just won't go away. 

After that I realized that I've developed anxiety and so went to a therapist who suggested meditation and went to a doctor who prescribed me buspar. They definitely help keep my anxiety at manageable levels but I really hope the anxiety goes away when I finally finish my grad program (only 1 semester left!)

For those of us with underlying problems, this just makes the it all much worse. So it’s really important to eat something.  I totally understand how hard it is. I’m going to explain what I do and if it helps anyone that would be wonderful.

For myself it’s really tough in the mornings. I often don’t sleep well to begin with or not at all ...and then when I get up I already feel like crap and I’m hardly interested in trying to make food. 

But I force myself to make a light shake including some protein powder, easily digestible and high-fiber produce, in small quantities and water. 

Things that work for me include mixed berries, small carrots, sometimes a banana, and so forth. I also add things like hemp hearts and Chia and flax seeds if my stomach is up to it. But stuff so highly nutritious and really good to help get started on the day. The protein powder I use is VEGA and that is because it’s plant-based and is pretty much pH neutral so it’s really easy on the stomach. Berries add flavour.

I still have to drink that slowly so I don’t cramp, gag or barf (oh joy :-) ...but once I get it into my stomach I usually feel a bit better and then over the next few hours I can eat a bit more.

I understand how rough it is to deal with this stuff, But if you get a chance, please try something like this and see if it helps you. 

Liquid (even thickened) is generally a lot easier on the stomach than solid foods, especially when it’s upset. If you do make a shake and find it still difficult to get down just add more water and drink slowly. 

I hope this helps a little bit. Good luck everybody",,,,,1548381482,,,eew635q,,t3_ajfp5v,,True,t3_ajfp5v,/r/Anxiety/comments/ajfp5v/its_a_vicious_cycle/eew635q/,,1548381483,6,True,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,,,,,,,False,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",,,,,,,,,,,

That's not how life works at all.

Why would you make a sprint for the end of your life just to be the fastest, no matter what comes in between? 

You only get to do this once. 

You don't need to be moving all the time. The end of your life is not a goal to sprint for, it's just that, an ending. Don't spend your life running towards it. It's going to come at some point, but why be so keen?

Nobody is getting out of this alive, so quit running and start setting your own pace. Do what makes you happy, do what it takes to support yourself and those that matter to you. Do what you can to make this place a better one than it was when you appeared here one day. Do what you can to help people around you. You only get to visit this little rock in the middle of infinity once. You're here for a limited time. Don't run for the exit, or you'll be missing out on so much.

I spent a lot of time trying to get an answer, for I guess what there isn't an answer for! It's seeming, which I doubt I would've realized before, that I shouldn't be trying to analyze it so much. I'm seeming to get, that Anxiety could be similar to a fever? Sometimes it's good, and tells you that you need to rest. But could also be to the point of where you can't get out of bed. yet, it's also similar since you can't always tell when you have a fever? There have been times I'm sure when I've had a fever but didn't realize it.  
Not trying to compare anxiety to a fever, that'd be improper, I know anxiety can be much worse. Just an example of my train of thought. I tend to ""compare"" things in order to understand the circumstances, I guess.

There are so many options for getting help with anxiety and seeing a Gp will be a great first step. The best things to tell a doctor is how you are struggling ie what can’t you do... trouble sleeping/ not concentrating on daily things/ not leaving the house/having thoughts you can’t control/ feeling tired and low/ not eating-eating too much and changes in weight or general health. Things like this will help a doctor pin-point what will help you most... do if start by maybe writing down what you’d like to say. Make a list of things that you think are most important, also note physical symptoms as well as mental thoughts and feelings separately if it helps. Doctors are well aware it’s difficult to talk about so may ask you questions to help. Don’t feel pressured. 

Some options might include medication like anti-depressants but do ask about therapy like local counselling or CBT because that will really help you in the long run. Medication will not be a cure all. Don’t feel like you have to say yes to the medication offered, you don’t. You are more than allowed to ask for other avenues. 

This sounds like a lot but depending on what the doctor suggests do book another appointment in a few weeks after the first with the same doctor to follow up on how your feeling. 

Other things would be to look up your local mental health charity’s online and drop them a message, they’ll be happy to give you some detailed advice.

I was just like you - super adventurous and super extroverted, but I’ve had been dealing with onset panic attacks and chronic dizziness since mid-November. I went to 7 doctors and the E.R 3 times but they never really tested me and just said it was anxiety. As the months went by, the worst it got. I had quit my drop, dropped out of school, and hid myself in my home because anytime I went outside with stimuli I felt extremely uncomfortable with my physical symptoms. My dizziness is described as “near-fainting”. I would feel extremely light headed and on the edge of blanking out. This usually resulted in me having panic attacks because of the discomfort. My fear was that something was wrong with my brain. I would feel immense pressure or numbness in my head from the anxiety and stress and I truly believed I was dying for the first few months of this. Finally, the third time I went to the ER from one of the worst panic attacks ever, they gave me a CT scan to reassure me and also prescribed me an SSRI. I have read that SSRIs can help a lot with CSD, and I’m having a few better days now, though I’ve only been on SSRI for a little less than a month and hope that I’ll keep making progress as time goes by.

I may be slightly off in how I word this, because I haven't actually studied how the brain works myself- but my understanding is that it has to do with the chemicals released when you feel anxious. The whole ""fight or flight"" stuff. That your mind goes through the same process as it does when you feel like you're about to be attacked/ that something bad will happen, so you're constantly trying to figure out ""what is attacking you."" So the first things you think are that you're sick, or something is wrong physically because that makes the most sense. But it is all caused by the overall feeling of ""something is wrong."" So it is easy to come up with the wrong answers when it is something you can't see.

It’s the idea that you focus your time and thoughts on the current task and nothing else.. a lot like mindfulness. Your in that moment with that task.

Also this goes hand in hand with not letting your anxiety guilt you for not spending all your time on your anxieties. I’ve been there. 

It takes a lot of time to train yourself to not act on your emotions, you do it all the time physically with not running out of the room, slightly similar with your mental landscape, you can’t choose what thoughts pop into your head, but you do choose to give them more energy by picking them apart or making them bigger. 

I don’t mean this to push aside your anxiety, you can let all the stress out and worry, it’s only natural.

I hadn’t realised that gradually over time I’d experienced such a big change in my state of mind. And then I felt kind of like an idiot for not starting meds sooner. 
It was a huge relief to get away from the worst of the anxiety; naturally I’ve had to make other changes to move forward but in the state I was in it wouldn’t have been possible to even focus on these techniques (prior to starting on the meds). 
My recommendation is to keep an open mind and remember that some people genuinely don’t understand the nature of mental health or how it can be addressed. The decision is yours, and if you try it for a month and don’t think it’s helping you can always stop. Naturally medication isn’t always suitable and it’s not the only answer BUT in my case it gave me the support I needed to kick start my recovery. Now I’m feeling so much better and I barely recognise that person I was just before starting medication - she was so agitated, upset and negative all the time, had trouble sleeping and couldn’t ever properly relax.

PetuniaAnn,,,,[],,,,text,t2_da0r9,"I personally don't have any children. But I did grow up with pretty severe anxiety and still have moderate anxiety on a daily basis as an adult. This is kinda long and probably unwanted but this is my experience and different things I've tried. 


For me personally I have always done better on a set predictable schedule. Even now as an adult, I feel better if I grocery shop on Saturdays, cook a big meal Sunday and pack lunches for me to take to work all week from that. It's little things that help. I'm not a big fan of ssri's in general. I've tried a few but they haven't helped me as much as a schedule and adjusting my diet and vitamins. 

I've been taking B12 for a while and it's helped me but recently I started melatonin and magnesium after looking into it, so maybe looking into some vitamins might assist on this journey for you.


He may also just do better on a schedule so he knows what to expect each day. I was always better as a child when I knew what was coming. On Thursdays I went shopping with my step mom. On Sundays we had extended family dinner. We even had a chart that described what chores were expected to be done each day and by who (big extended family... Long story, but wasn't unreasonable and was made as fairly as possible). Summers were pretty bad for me because I didn't really have any expectations or anything to be done so it was easy to get lost in cyclical anxiety and lash out because of it. I can understand it's hard to keep a semi-set schedule as a single mom because you have to work and take care of him and find time to take care of yourself. Even something as simple as we always order pizza on Friday nights can help with severe anxiety. Because it's the same thing and it's expected, even if you get different toppings or order from different places, you still get pizza every Friday. Maybe try to find groups or things he can do at little or no cost over the summer. Libraries usually have free things going on and I'm sure there are summer programs that he could attend if you can afford them and whatnot.  I was better with projects. I cleaned and reorganized the garage over a couple weeks one summer and I knew I had something to do each day. I made my own plan and had control over it but it was still a project my parents asked me to do. I was a pretty compliant child so this may not work with your son, but it definitely helped me to have things like that.


Choices are also good options, depending on the situation. A lot of anxiety stems from needing to control situations for whatever reason. When things unexpectedly change I would sprial and not be able to function because I no longer had control of situation. Even fries or tator tots gives him a choice which will help him feel in control. Would you rather do x or y is great within reason. Chinese or sushi is one thing but he will still have to find a way to cope with things he has to do. Yes you have to go to school, yes you have to respect your teachers, yes you have to take a shower every day, yes you have to do this chore today. Some things are not options and he's not too young to have to deal with that. It's not an option for him to be verbally abusive towards you or your ex husband. Because if you let him it'll probably only get worse (source: my step brother had a lot of issues growing up and only got worse when he was constantly placated and got what he wanted all the time). My parents didn't really understand my anxiety so I didn't often have choices about things which in retrospect likely made it worse but they didn't know any better. 


When I had anxiety attacks, I couldn't make choices but I could say yes or no, so that's how my fiance helped me through them. Instead of asking how he could help me or what I needed he started asking if I wanted water or could he touch me to comfort me. They don't sound terribly different but when your entire body is panicking and your mind is racing its much easier to say yes or no than to verbalize what you need. The hardest thing to do is find what helps him specifically, or what triggers worse behavior. After years of just thinking I was overreacting for being extremely uncomfortable and not knowing how to communicate that, I eventually realized that I have anxiety about large social situations. I prefer to have the option to leave whenever I wish, so I don't host parties or large get togethers at my home because the reality of that is I can't leave.


For every anxiety issue I've ever had it helps me to break down what happened afterward when I feel safe again. I don't like to talk about it with others. It might help him manage better if he writes it down or thinks about better ways to have handled the situation. It's almost impossible to talk yourself down during an episode like that, but afterward it could help to have a conversation about it. ""Do you feel this was an appropriate reaction to x situation?"" ""How would you feel if you asked me to do x and I treated you the way you treated me?"" 


I know I've said a lot and I'm sorry if it's not helpful or if I sound condescending but I promise it's not intentional at all. But I did grow up with anxiety I've tried to find ways to manage it. These are things that have worked for me or I've seen work for others. At the end of the day I wish you luck with this because it's not an easy fight.

Let your anxiety loose, overthink, visualize the worse case scenario. Humiliation? Booing? What is the worse that could happen? It's going to painful, I understand. Cry if you want, it has helped me many times. Soon you'll realize the absurdity of your thoughts. And 9 out 10 times things you've visualised never happens, and even when things happen exactly how you thought (you've to be extremely unlucky for that to happen) you'll find yourself coping with that situation quite well than what you have visualised.

For community, not sure where you are or what your financial situation is, but gyms can foster an immense sense of community, feeling like a part of something-- so can churches (if you are so inclined) or volunteering. 

Feeling stuck is the hardest part, the only thing I can say is that you have a big win right off the bat-- you are self aware. If you know you are stubborn and aloof, you can work to change those things-- not necessarily forever, but maybe enough to open yourself up to new situations and people who you might connect with.

What I mean by that is it's totally normal and okay to feel this way, but you don't have too much to worry about. When I went into middle school, only one of my friends went to the same school as me. It was really scary at first, but eventually I found a group of people that genuinely enjoyed my company and we're still friends 10 years later. 

One sucky part of growing up is that you might lose some friends, and I don't want to lie to you about that. However, if these friends of yours are actually good friends, you going to school isn't going to change that and they'll be in high school when you get there, regardless of which high school, they'll still make time for you if they genuinely care. ***If*** you do seem to find yourself drifting apart from these friends, please don't think it's your fault, that's just part of growing, but I'd bet they'll be glad to stay friends with you.

You'll have and make plenty of other friends either way, school is a fantastic place to do that and there will always be someone who wants to give you a chance.

The_Firmament,,,,[],,,,text,t2_16b2f7,"It's okay, at least you have commonality on your side since flying is a fear for a loooot of people. Myself included! Now, this is a newer thing for me. I've been flying, intermittently, all my life, but it's only the last few years where it's really become an anxiety-inducing issue for me. It's left me confused, frustrated, and just plain upset, as well as desperate to get it under control so I'm not turning away opportunities. 

So, I understand. Again, since I'm new to this I'm not sure I can offer you many tips or advice. For some statistics work since we all know being in a plane is far safer than being in a car and accidents rarely happen and the people aboard are well trained and want to make it safely through just as much as you. Others have said to bring enough things aboard to make you distracted, and then there is always medication. 

I have to fly in a few months and the thought is filling me with absolute dread. What I'm using to keep that at bay for now is envisioning myself in the place I'll be once the flight is over, knowing that it's something I really want to do, there are people I really want to see, and the pure excitement of just doing something different and breaking out of the routine for a moment. When the moment comes when I have to step onto that plane again, I won't lie, I would *really* really like to be medicated. I have a feeling I'll be even worse this time, and all I can think to get me through that is some sort of anti-anxiety pill. Currently, I don't have access to such things, but by then I hope to.

First of all, everyone doubts their abilities, but I'm sure you're so much better at what you do than you think. We're our own harshest critics. 

Also, the only way to find out if you're good at a job is to try it. There is absolutely no shame in realizing you're not good at a particular job, or you can't shine your best because of the environment. That isn't failure, that's learning something new about yourself. They won't hire you if they don't think you'll do well at the job to start with, so if they hire you that means they believe in you.

Whilst religion can provide support, it is not a magic cure all. I have had some great relief from praying, but it is not a magic cure-all in the way that your mother portrays it.

If anything I think it is the other way around: Humans were originally created to not have sin and not be flawed: But that all later turned out to be a bit different. Originally humans weren't meant to be afraid of things. To get ill. To die. That all happened during the fall of man.

But I'll leave this for be now, since you mentioned you are not religious.

I can't imagine having to live with anxiety since being 7-8 years old. You have been anxious for most of your life! That requires some dedication, willpower and strength to get through. It is sad to hear your mother can't help you in this battle, when you need it most. She is probably unsure of what to do, hence her reaction. She uses the thing that comforts her most hoping that it will comfort you too. Unfortunately it backfired in this case.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing that may be worth it is to leave it to rest now, and talk to her later. About what bothered you. About what bothers her. Try to be neutral, and not go into things too deep.

I couldn’t even look people in the eye, or have them in my peripheral vision because my anxiety would burst and it would look like a deer in headlights. I was always thinking of what people thought of me, and due to my anxiety people don’t want to be around me. 

I used to tell myself that I hate myself 20x a day and that I want to die. But this changed recently due to something that happened, I changed what I told myself. Instead of saying I hate myself, I changed it to I love myself and other inspiring and nice things. You would not believe the effect it has done to me in the last two weeks.

I still struggle with extreme anxiety but it has gotten better. I no longer automatically say those hateful things to myself, my mind automatically says the positive things now. I have tried to change every negative thought into a positive thought, no matter what.

Just last night I had the first positive dream in myself. I have never had a dream like this. It was my art teacher telling me and looking at me in the eyes smiling, telling me I have changed, with a happy voice and smile. Later In the same dream I made a person laugh, a boy slapped my butt (no homo) and we laughed about it. A positive dream. 

I usually have negative dreams about embarrassing stuff that would happen to me. So this was new. My mind is now adapting to those new thoughts I tell myself. 

This new state of mind has helped me so much. It’s so much easier than telling myself those old negative thoughts that would drain me mentally and leave me depressed. Now my head feels right and I don’t get tired from anxiety as much. 

I’m not to good at explaining myself, but I hope my insight about telling yourself nice things instead of negative things has helped me.

Hmm, if you want to give them the benefit of the doubt you should go with ""forgot"".
I'm no Holmes, but let me come up with an hypothesis: girlfriend obviously knows partner's birthday, tells everyone, and gets everyone involved. In your case, everybody happened to forget. Sucks, but tell me you haven't ever forgotten a birthday... most likely they weren't consciously choosing to ignore it, they weren't trying to hurt you. I know your head will roll with the worst case scenario because that way you feel prepared for worse, but try not to, otherwise if you start acting like they don't want to be your friends it might as well be a self fulfilling prophecy. Just really do give them the benefit of the doubt and keep being their usual friend, it will play out accordingly either way won't it? But it would be sad to end friendships just on what's possibly a single unlucky event.

You're not alone in these stresses, it was in this period that I got my first psychological problems like anxiety. If you can, try to find a therapist. Try to bring structure in your life. Get up in the morning, search for a job for some hours, relax and rest the rest of the day.

You can learn some useful skills while looking for a job, like cooking, cleaning, washing clothes, ironing, fixing your car/bicycle,... we all had to learn these skills at one point.

I had horrible panic attacks and would get heart palpitations at night every time I'm about to sleep (sleeping becomes IMPOSSIBLE). That stopped after 5-7 days from taking Sertraline.

Also important... If you stop taking, it will become rapid and much worse than the first time. I risked it after a month then it started mid-night when I was asleep and I would shake and feel like dying. It's extremely difficult. I'd recommend starting from 25mg Sertraline if you really feel bad. All SSRIs have side effects.

Everything is going to be OK. Take a long deep breathe in, and breathe out. Take a look around the room. As much as it may scare you, become aware of your surroundings. Everything you’re feeling is completely in your head. Non-existent. Just a creation of your imagination.

I used to get anxiety attacks every night before going to sleep, taking a shower and even walking down the street about this. Just earlier tonight, I walked the streets of my town at night with 0 fear. The fear will go away. It’s not permanent. Try watching something that will make you laugh, something that you know you always enjoy.

Sorry to hear you’re going through that.

For example, I found school to be really hard when I was worried since the people I hung out with weren’t so much my friends but just a group of people ya know. But spending time with people who you feel safe with helps and just try to keep yourself occupied. Its easier said than done but try distract yourself from it, go outside and do something maybe. But also if you’re still worried about it go to a doctor and let them tell you youre ok. Sometimes its just a matter or needing that absolute reassurance. I know even though when I went to the doctor that he said they could just xray me or whatever, he still told me that there is a 99.9% chance of survival for testicular cancer nowadays, so long as its removed early. 

Im not sure what else to tell you, but my friend survived and is fully functioning again, so there is definitely hope whatever happens. But talk to someone about exactly how youre feeling and also try to remember things you have been worried about before and how they never happened.

cuisletaomanna,,,,[],,,,text,t2_50qqxshv,"all your symptoms are normal for anxiety, shaking, tunnel vision, heavy chest, sweating, hyperventilating, tunnel vision.

The fact it only happens when you have no where to pull over really points to an anxiety issue.

Cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy work best for this.

You start off doing short trips to areas that trigger your anxiety, you let yourself feel the fear while also learning how to calm yourself, then you slowly increase the time you spend in the places that cause the anxiety.

sounds easy but it's very hard to force yourself to do something that you find makes you feel uncomfortable, but as you practice the anxiety does improve and you'll find yourself feeling much more confident  

The problem with avoidance, is you can start to get anxious in other areas and soon without even being fully aware you're doing it, you've started to avoid  a lot of things 


I always suggest talking to your doctor just to be sure

barefootone,,,,[],,,,text,t2_15gqedq1,"Anxiety comes in a few different forms.  What all anxiety had in common is some element of habitual thought patterns which tend to increase the anxiety.  

Taking medication may help full some of the resulting hormones released for anxiety but will also come with other side effects which are often quite strong and unpleasant.  More importantly, you will not be working with the cause and you will not be learning new tools to help you overcome your anxiety.  

While I understand your reluctance to see a therapist, as it can be very confronting and painful and difficult to speak to someone about things that you don’t feel ready for, I can not stress strongly enough that medication alone is not going to be a solution for you.  

You might want to consider seeing a therapist who is willing to agree to not go into certain personal topics.  You could, for example, talk about anxiety itself, how it feels and how you can learn to change your thoughts and responses without talking about the ultimate original causes.  Sometimes going that deep isn’t really what’s needed anyway. 

Finally, decide that you are going to read books on anxiety.  Make it your new part time job to learn about yourself and your anxiety and how it works in the body and start practicing recommended techniques.

barefootone,,,,[],,,,text,t2_15gqedq1,"The mind and body are connected and being anxious about sensations can amplify those sensations and over time can even cause those sensations without any other physical cause.  

Being hyper sensitive to every sensation also means that you become aware of the hundreds or thousands of sensations that are always normally happening in your body.  We are after all living in a physical being that is constantly in motion.  Every part of our body is active through digestion, oxygen exchange, and normal  functioning.  

The issue here is anxiety and through your heightened anxiety, your awareness and amplification of everything.  The fix is to work on that anxiety and learn tools and tricks which will decrease your awareness over time and change your thought patterns when you do feel a physical sensation.

My best advice is to really understand that if the doctors tell you that you have a healthy heart then your heart can withstand your anxiety.

In other words, your heart will be fine even if it feels like it’s about to explode.

Prozac 10 mg: hooo boy.

I made a lot of things in the 4 weeks I was on it, but it didnt really help otherwise. 

Zoloft 25 mg: BRAIN FOG GALORE. I couldn't remember commitments I made, couldn't focus at work, couldn't sleep, and was tired all the time. This also did nothing to touch my issues. Again I dropped this after 4 weeks.

Effexor 75 mg: I wasn't putting much stock in this at this point, but I was at the end of my rope. The first night I made the mistake of not taking it with a substantial amount of food. I woke up in a sweat and heaving. Gave me some weird neck stiffness for a couple of days and I had legit headaches for a while. Side effects varied from day to day it seemed until about 6 weeks in, then the only bad thing I still had and continue to have is insomnia. I have trazodone to help out with this.

When I'm already in a panic attack, he puts his arm around me as physical support until I calm down. Trying to talk someone out of a panic attack does not work.

Walk walk walk walk walk.

Do you live in an apartment or a neighborhood?  If the latter, walk around the neighborhood.  I took a two mile walk today (avoiding passers by by 6 feet) and came home and was able to eat dinner.  I also struggle with anxiety in relation to food.

If you’re in an apartment, try going up and down the stairs.  Walk laps around the common area (if it’s not filled with people).  If that’s not an option, walk back and forth across your apartment and listen to some music.

Walk up and down the street (if it’s not filled with people).

Sit on the couch with your hands in your lap and count breaths.  3 long seconds in, hold for 2, 5-7 long seconds out.  Numbers don’t have to be exact - just slow it down.  Slow it down and focus solely on your breathing.  Do it for as long as you like or are able.

Find a mantra and repeat it.  Maybe something like “this is serious but statistically there is an overwhelming chance I will be fine.”  Or my personal favorite go to, “this too shall pass.”

Do these things as often and as necessary as your are able.  If you have to do them ten times a day - or more - that’s fine.  It doesn’t mean you’re weak.  This is a scenario that is inducing stress in everyone - even those who don’t deal with anxiety - and that’s normal.  Some of us are just “lucky” enough that it is on top of other stress and anxieties.  

And as corny as it sounds, look in the mirror and smile.  Even if you’re crying inside (or outside).  Smile and tell yourself about some of the things you’re thankful for.  I know it sounds dumb and I know it doesn’t “fix” things but for me personally, it helps a ton.",,,,,1584672838,,,fkzk1au,False,t3_flko5u,,True,t3_flko5u,/r/Anxiety/comments/flko5u/this_is_a_bad_time_for_people_with_anxiety/fkzk1au/,,1584677163,2,True,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,,,,,,,False,{},,[],False,0.0,,[],,,False,,

aroc91,1404656753.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_h9wf9,"I can throw some numbers at you, I guess. I've run statistical analysis on all the patients we've treated since 2013 (I started doing this in May of last year), so I've put together a pretty good overall picture. We use the Neurostar TMS system and have been since 2010. I can only assume other TMS systems have similar efficacies. We use the BDI (Beck's Depression Inventory) scale to assess and quantify progress. You may have taken this before or something similar like the Zung questionnaire. On average, *including* non-responders and those that ended up worse at the end of their treatment course, our records show a 44% improvement in patient scores. 

Neurostar states that 50% respond to treatment and 33% achieve complete remission. I wouldn't go that far just because I'm not sure what I would consider complete remission in the context of the BDI scale, but it has been effective. 10% of our patients see at least a 90% reduction in reported symptoms. Another 10% see at least an 80% reduction, so on and so forth in 10% intervals.

If any of these numbers don't make sense, don't hesitate to ask more about it. We have run into very few issues with insurance coverage. At this point, most insurance companies don't give us any issues, as long as you have an actual diagnosis of major depressive disorder and at least a couple failed medication trials of proper dosage and duration. 

I would definitely go ahead and talk to your nearest TMS provider and go in for a consult. It's 18-40 minutes per day, 5 days a week, for 7 weeks (or up to 9 if they require a tapering schedule). Basically just sitting in a dentists chair. The treatment itself is tolerable. Most describe it as a tapping sensation. Some have more discomfort than others, but we've had very few that actually find it unbearable and have to quit within the first few sessions. It gets better over the first week or two and we have actually had two people get accustomed to it enough to fall asleep in the chair.

Secondly, everyone has anxiety to some degree, it's good for us and has been a survival mechanism for human kind. If you're looking to find out if you have an anxiety disorder, please talk to a professional (links in the side bar). 

These are symptoms of anxiety but they can also be negative symptoms of drug use (prescription or otherwise). If you have had a prescription I would go and talk to the doctor who gave you this and see what they say. Sorry, I know you're looking for more immediate help but unfortunately this is the best advice. 

If the exercises you're doing give you temporary relief, perhaps trying doing more of them or increasing the amount (slowly) or varying the ways you exercise; different types of exercise, different ways of meditating. Also, if you can, try to find if the source of discomfort is something in your life. Lastly, please don't beat yourself up about this or give yourself guilt, millions of people go through feelings of anxiety and you shouldn't feel guilty for having a normal human experience.

Not many realize the difference of objectivity, subjectivity, or relativity. It’s natural for humans to only consider themselves first because we’re just here to survive. It used to make me feel anxious because it feels like I’m being ganged up on, but I know that there are other people out there who are open-minded and understand that not everyone is the same and different people grow up differently, so therefore have opposing views because of their different experiences. 

Anyway. I know that it can be annoying to constantly have to explain yourself to other people. I’ve stopped because I don’t care enough anymore about people who are very defensive in that manner.

I know, but I'm trying to remind myself I'm being paranoid. Obviously not knowing her for a long time, I don't know her type, but having known my friend forever, I do know his type. My self-esteem/jealousy issue here doesn't come from me worrying about him liking her, cause she's just far outside people he's been with. I guess a caveat here is that I've done stuff with her and some of her girlfriends too, but them wondering why he doesn't hang around with us too when invited is always a topic. She does genuinely want to see more of him.


More so I feel like I feel so vexxed because I don't want to feel like I'm being settled for? I don't want to be the plan B, or that she would otherwise just be *available* to my friend because he's a better more mature person in general were he interested at all, regardless of whether her and I have sparks. That's the scariest feeling of all to me. I just for once want to feel confident that this person is interested in me during our time together and that I'm not in competition with someone because I've been left behind everytime I have been in that situation. I'm 25 and the only actual relationship I was in lasted four months and I was cheated on the entire time, and I haven't really grown into any new relationships since then. And the girl who cheated on me didn't even have any stereotypical signs of someone who may not be respecting the relationship, what you two sort of hope from one another. She didn't really give me any sign to feel concerned and it was only through friends that I found out what was happening.


And I guess the thing is we *do* have sparks, or, at least according to our mutual group we do, since people keep sliding us comments about how we are with one another. But because I've been so consistently wrong in the past I'm scared to come out and admit that something is working, and my jealous suspicions only make things so much worse, because I do honestly believe it, because I've been right before. It's like a horrible self-fulfilling prophecy.

There are days i can’t even fake a smile



Thoughts gets overrun

All i need right now is a fucking gun

To put me out of this suffering and agony

End everything related to this misery



I’m trying not to break, but i’m so tired

Is this all fate, or just what is required ?

Is there something more fucked up I could do ?

Everything just feels like a waste of time

That one quote has helped me a lot with anxiety and panic attacks. Mine usually triggers with my TMJ/constant jaw pain so my brain jumps to extreme conclusions ie, I'll have to live in this state forever, it's cancer, I won't wake up because I'll be dead, etc.

It's hard to stop those kind of thoughts, especially when they escalate my anxiety and make my chest feel like it's going to blow up and feel like I'm not able to breathe.. but it helps me to know that if a panic attack does come on, it's a temporary adrenaline kick with the ""fight or flight"" feeling kicking in. 

It's not easy to just ""accept"" or ""acknowledge"" anxiety and panic attacks and watching a YouTube video sure won't fix it right away, but I know it has helped me a bit in understanding why and what it is. I hope that it can help others who may not have seen it or thought about anxiety and panic attacks in that way.

In my case, I had my first suicidal thought at 7 or 8. There’s a clear family history. I am as clear a cut case for the genetic factor in Major Depressive Disorder as you’re ever going to find. Interestingly enough, there’s some evidence to suggest that people like me respond better to medication that people with later onset or less severe symptoms. 

My theory is that there’s basically two kinds of depression, like diabetes. There’s the kind you’re born with (Type I) and the kind you acquire (Type II). Regardless of which kind you have, you might need to take medication (insulin), you might not. Either way, you’re probably going to need to learn how to make lifestyle changes (therapy) to manage your illness.

In my own experience, after I was diagnosed in my teens, I went through a lot of therapy but it didn’t do much good for me until I was finally medicated. Then, once my dosage was stable and I got to the “therapeutic” effects around 6 weeks later, it was like night and day. I felt stuff! Boy did I *ever* feel stuff! I felt terrible! It was horrible, but it was kind of great at the same time!

yadda yadda yadda, a few weeks of therapy later, I was stable enough to be released back into the wild. I had a few setbacks along the way and the last couple of years have been really rough and knocked my medication situation around. I also have really good insurance so I was able to really get into therapy long term and get to the bottom of some things.

I have been to a few therapists but it never worked out... I'm sure there are professional ones but sometimes it seemed like my therapists had more baggage than me lol.

I also agree that I definitely need to stick up for myself. I really let that situation get out of hand.

I have a great relationship with my partner, but friendships were always difficult. I've been trying to be proactive and ask people to do things/ communicate more/ open myself up more recently. It's really scary but it's brought some positive results. I'm generally trying to not be so hard on myself, because there's nothing wrong with me, just people have their own shit to get on with a lot of the time, and that's OK. I think it's easy to assume that everyone around us has amazing friendship groups, but I bet if you asked those girls who go brunching every saturday what was really going down, they'd all have beef with each other in some shape or form. I think it's braver to not settle for a mediocre group of people, and go out on your own and figure out what you really want from a friendship. I read 'How to be a person in the World' by Heather Havrilevsky, and that changed my perspective on friendships quite a bit. It's very wise and funny and will probably make you cry! In a good way.

Zaravira,,,,,,,,,,"Actually this screams 'introvert' to me. I am introverted and this is normal to me. Even if I am fine in such a chatty situation to begin with, a very busy chatty person rattling my ears off of my head can rapidly turn me uncomfortable and straining myself to keep up appearances. Eye contact is an indicator you're engaged in the conversation and the other person, but as I gradually feel more strained, my eyes are everywhere but on them because I just want them to be quiet or let me run away. Eventually I'll be an incoherent zombie and at that point get easily annoyed by anyone asking or telling me anything, but I tend to leave the situation before that happens and seek sweet sweet silence, with perhaps 1 other that I feel comfortable with.

It’s a signal that you’re not acknowledging something your body needs — a good night’s sleep, healthy living, or being surrounded with love. You’re carrying too much weight on your shoulders that has gone unrecognized for too long. When they happen, it’s a wake up call to find the underlying issue, and face it head on.

I also agree on the thought that maybe we arent living the same world as others. Maybe those who struggle with anxiety see/feel things differently than others who it does not affect as much. It could be why it is hard for people who do not experience panic attacks/anxiety to understand. I have had many people tell me its all in my head, made up, just cheer up, etc. which I then think, if you really understood how I felt, you wouldn't think it was that easy. Almost like its a choice to feel this way, which it is most definitely not.
Luckily, for me now I at least have a support system at home (my boyfriend of almost 2 years supports me unconditionally, even through me getting kicked out of work and skipping class today which I feel like a total failure for.) and it helps me get through the day, one day at a time.

My dad never stops talking to anyone/anything and it annoys everyone because you can't have an actual conversation with him.  It's just him talking, and talking over you when you try to comment on something.  And you get stuck listening to him for hours about stuff you don't care about.  I'm so afraid I'll end up like this.  

I actually posted an apology on fb last night for talking too much, and all I really do is post a gratitude list every other day or so.  They're just lists of what I'm thankful for, and I explain why I'm thankful for them.  Sometimes the explanations are long and I'm worried that people don't care about my explanations.

And then, my fiancé works afternoons/nights (started in October).  I'm so used to him being home and being able to tell him all of the stuff I'm thinking but now he's not home.  So I send him long text messages where I'm trying to have a conversation with him.  He can't really text back, his job is loading and unloading boxes of meat onto/off of trucks for 8 hours, but when he can he'll send a short message in between my essays.  Sometimes I start to think he thinks that I'm annoying and that's why he doesn't respond but I try to remind myself that he literally cannot text back while carrying 30-60 lb boxes.

It wasn’t until this guy made me realize that anxiety and panic aren’t dangerous that fear began to lose its grip. It took a little bit of courage but this worked wonders for me. There is also a book called DARE by Barry McDonough that reiterated the same points. Both helped me immensely.

Leonorcp,1467762151.0,,,,,,,,t2_z9zov,"First of all, I don't think you should stick with the ""you're strange"" idea in your head. Since you're not sure about what he said, there's no point in analyzing it. Your mind will always take you to million different places, questioning yourself to the point of you thinking ""there's something wrong with me"". You have no idea whether he actually said that, so there's no point in trying to figure out a situation that has already happened. You have no idea what was going on in his head, what his actual words were, if he was under the influence of alcohol/drugs, if he was a very judgmental and rude person... 

Even if he did say that, that is an opinion of a random individual. It doesn't mean anything about you, it doesn't tell you that perhaps you shouldn't look like this or do that. The most important thing is: you should feel comfortable in your own skin. Once you do, random strangers saying stuff like that won't make you doubt yourself or feel the need to investigate why they would say something like that.

I'm not blaming you for thinking like that though, I doubt myself as well, too much actually. And that's why I'm telling you all of this, I know how people can say hurtful things that make you ruminate and overthink. But please understand that no matter what you do, other people will always have something negative to say about it. There's always that one person that will criticize you - which is kind of ridiculous, since we all have our own flaws. 

Conclusion: even if he did think you looked strange, that doesn't mean you actually look strange. Would you shout at someone like that? Point to someone their flaws? That is unnecessary and judgmental, and that's what he did, meanwhile you were doing your own thing and causing no harm. Also, him feeling the need to point out a flaw in other person tells something about himself. Maybe he is self-conscious and feels like he needs to bring other people down. Perhaps is very critical of himself, and so he is also harsh on other people.

This isn't one of those situations where I stay up late wasting time either, I'm often in bed by 11:30 ~ 12:30, and simply toss and turn until 4. I just cannot turn my brain off to sleep -- I think about everything, worry about everything, even things that have nothing to do with me, such as, if my grandmother will have food to eat in the morning when I get up. 

What I found helped though, are: 

1. Reading. As stated by another Redditor earlier, reading helps you focus away from thinking your own thoughts and imagining the world fueled by the book you're reading. It's temporary but if you read until you're tired enough, you might even fall asleep in the middle of reading. 

2. Drinking. I don't really suggest this one, but I did do it for a few months when I was deeply depressed. Definitely in moderation though, such as a glass of wine, may help to relax a little. Perhaps combine this with reading. Be warned that if you fight the urge to sleep when you're drowsy, this might end up keeping you awake for even longer. 

3. Journaling. Write all the things that are bothering you down, so that you can at least not have to worry about not remembering your problems. For the time being, rid of them onto paper and then tackle them the next day. 

4. Chamomile tea. I'm not sure how this works, I was recommended this to me by a friend so I tried it a few times and each time I've had success with it. 

5. Meditation. Self reflection. Don't dodge the bad things you overthink about, just tackle them head on. Find your inner peace. Sounds like a bunch of bologna, but it works well. 

6. Turning on a YouTube loop of rainstorm sounds. There's just something magical about the sound of rain that eases me to sleep. And by easing me to sleep,  I mean not even wanting to wake up for work.

buffybot93,1468504588.0,,,,,,,,t2_zi285,"See if you can find someone who specializes in DBT. It's very practical and helpful for anxiety and panic attacks, but there are deeper, more complex layers to it that help with depression, self image, self love, etc. (Also my psychiatrist says that in her experience it helps people overcome anxiety and depression way better than meds alone)

Seeing a DBT specialized counselor has changed so much for me. I was on Xanax and Klonopin for 5 years for anxiety and panic and I was able to taper off the benzos without becoming a total mess (I am over a month clean now) because of the DBT techniques she taught me and the DBT work we we've been doing in session. 

Some DBT techniques that have really helped me are: TIPP (Temperture, Intense excersize, Paced breathing, Progressive relaxation) for severe panic attacks (if you Google tipp dbt there are a bunch of dbt guides that will explain what to do), mindfulness/guided meditation (I really like the app Headspace for this), using your senses to self sooth by focusing in on, for example, every red object in the room, or really study an object nearby as if you were going to have to draw it from memory, listen to the sounds around you, focus on them and identify them, concentrate on smells or how the air feels on your face or the clothes feel on your body, etc.

spookie_ghostie,1483759139.0,,,,,,,,t2_147rjn,"This happens to me sometimes, it was a lot worse when I was your age (I’m 18 now) but the best thing to do when you are anxious over not getting enough sleep is to just force yourself to breathe slowly. That will calm you down physically. Then, you just need to realize if you’re not tired, you won’t be able to fall asleep. Especially if you are anxious. So do something that will calm you down and distract you, like read a book or draw or maybe watch quiet television, something boring and calming.

You just have to tell yourself that you will eventually fall asleep, but don’t try and force yourself to. Try to not use your phone or any screen for an hour before bed. Change your sheets, take a warm bath, drink some milk, just make yourself feel good and relaxed.

Also, try melatonin! It’s not a prescription drug, it’s a hormone you can get at CVS/grocery store/Target that makes you feel sleepy naturally.

lindab,1214258019.0,,,,,,,,t2_36feh,"I used to be terrified of public speaking. Like can't-sleep-the-night-before, heart-in-your-throat, palpitation-shaky, sweaty-palms type of terror.  But my work has forced me into it over the last decade. I now have no fear of giving presentations to rooms full of strangers (PhDs, Scientists, Engineers, etc). Some of my presentations are recorded for future training sessions as well (no pressure!). My best advice is to know your material well. Know it better than you know yourself. No one is going to care if you're a little nervous or stumble over some words, just keep going. Even after these years, I still trip over words occasionally. No one cares. If they don't care, then I don't either. Just correct yourself and move on. Your audience wants to know your material. So tell them. 

Don't be afraid to take pauses when speaking. You don't have to fill every moment with words, and you don't have to fill spaces with filler words such as um, etc. But allowing for pauses gives you a moment to think, and also gives your audience to moment to digest what you've told them. I always give a pause after making my most important points. Let them have a moment to take a mental note. 

Let them ask questions. I love questions. I love it if someone interrupts me to ask a question, because it shows me that they are engaged and want to know more. When I begin a presentation I encourage people to feel free to ask questions as we go along. I don't know if this is appropriate for your situation or not. But for me, if someone asks a question it helps me to relax in so many ways. It makes the presentation more like a dialogue, and encourages other people also to get involved and ask questions. It only takes a moment to answer a question, and then you just continue on where you left off. In my field, sometimes people asking questions will actually help me to know that they have a stronger interest in specific parts of my presentation, and that helps me to gear the rest of the presentation more to their needs/interests, so it makes my presentation even better (My presentations are for a subject that has a wide-range of topics, so the more questions the better!). 

I've gotten to a point where I actually ENJOY giving presentations and speaking, and it's now something I look forward to. It's the shock of my life. 

So yes, expect to be nervous at first. Everyone is. But the more practice you get, the less nervous you will be. And if you have to, you can get to a point where it's actually a little fun.

So, like it or not, I always have to burden my coworkers with the knowledge something is wrong with me. 


That being said, there's a big difference between physical conditions and mental conditions. The social stigma that is out there around anxiety makes me worried that people will view me negatively, which is not something I really worry about with my physical conditions. I don't really blast my mental diagnosis everywhere, I just share a little of my struggles with friends, and only my closest know how bad it really is. But I do make it a point to talk about mental illness as often as I can. If someone brings it up, I will talk to them about the generalities (without explicitly saying my own condition). I will make sure people know mental health is as important as physical health, and that telling people to just suck it up is as ignorant as telling someone with a broken leg to suck it up.

That said it was hard to admit, for me, because I was afraid he wouldn't understand or would underplay it but he was quite accommodating. I told him I didn't want any accommodation but if things suddenly get worse I would let him know I need to take sick time to sort it out.

That said I don't think it's fair to tell everyone. I don't want to burden my coworkers with the idea something is wrong with me. I also don't want to have to explain constantly when something upsets me. It is still very personal, in my opinion, and I think letting people know when it has impact on them is the best course of action even if there were no stigma to it.

JesusGreen,1307099363.0,,,,,,,,t2_5bqf6,"I don't listen to as much EDM as I used to a few years ago, but Avicii is one of the artists I can still consistently enjoy any time even when I'm not really in an EDM mood. Was definitely also Avicii that inspired me to try creating some of my own electronic music, which led to me making a couple of god awful tracks but having fun in the process. 

I'm usually not particularly phased by celebrity/musician deaths, even if I really liked the person, just because of the disconnect, and not knowing them personally. When I heard the news about Avicii though it was definitely different - I think in part just because of how unexpected it was, and I was hoping he'd start touring again and I'd get to see him live at some point. 

Watching his recent True Stories - Avicii documentary though really made it kick in. The way he described the stress he was going through, and how overwhelmed he was, damn that hit home. Gotta admire the man's strength though. I've found myself overwhelmed just by day to day life on numerous occasions, and he managed to play as many as around 320 shows in one year at one point even while going through all that anxiety and stress. Unfortunately it clearly took its toll. 

The worst was seeing how everyone around him was pushing him to do more, when he was clearly at his wits end. I think that part was even more painful to watch because I think all of us here have had situations like that, where we are so completely overwhelmed and we just want someone else to understand that - but no-one else seems to grasp the situation we're going through. The bit where he was in hospital and the guys with him are like ""Oh, they said you can leave if you wanted to.."", subtly hinting at him that he should play the show, made me feel sick, you could tell they cared more about the show than his health. That's a lonely place to be in, and it's a surprise he lasted as long as he did, all things considered.

I think the lesson that can be learned from his situation is that we really have to learn to cut those things out of our life that are bringing us down, and adding to our stress - and we really need to cultivate a positive support structure, rather than surrounding ourselves with people who feed off us and drag us down. It's one of the reasons I'm super grateful places like /r/anxiety/ exist, as this is an example of a support structure done right.

I don't know if you've done an AMA or anything or if you're a known celebrity on reddit, but I'd love to watch any of your stuff to support you, if so. As a side note, I also really enjoy comedy--it's one of the things that makes me feel normal.

dwade333miami,1324382585.0,,,,,,,,t2_6h72r,"Hiya. Sorry to hear your struggles are impacting your ability to pursue interests. Severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD made it impossible to pursue hobbies for a long time because I simply had no energy to give, the idea of being around others was terrifying, and I lost interest in everything. 

Something that may be worth trying would either be to start watching guitar tutorials on YouTube. Or you can try one-on-one lessons where you're not around so many others at once. Some may say that this is enabling, but I have to disagree. I think reaching goals in this case can happen in steps. Would it be cool to be in a martial arts class with a dozen people and sparring with them? Yes, but do the best you can with what you have. Sometimes the end goal is too far to jump to right away. It's okay to work your way to taking classes with others. 

Watching guitar tutorial videos may seem like a silly compromise, but if it's something you haven't done much of or at all, it's definitely a big deal because you are pursuing your hobbies and a part of something you enjoy. 

Good luck!

malikpol,1459183433.0,,,,,,,,t2_wpmpn,"Hey, 

I know what you are going through because I was \(maybe even am in the same position to a certain extent\). It's a horrible feeling but one thing that helped me deal with all of the job search and dealing with all the ""professional"" world is actively pushing myself outside the comfort zone that I became accustomed to. 

A little bit of background to myself, I went through two different universities \(one for Bachelor and the other for Masters\) and was even contemplating doing a PHD at one point. I was struggling like mad through my time at Masters, because my anxiety was occurring pretty much every day, but because I was seeing everyone around me doing things, I was motivating myself to pull through. I finished the degree with a good result and then it was the horrible time to start the job search. I was very anxious when filling out all the application forms and imagining what it will be like if i get the job. All sorts of thoughts going through my head \(similar to yourself\) such as avoiding contact in fear of being criticized, putting a lot of pressure on myself to make sure I do the best job \(what if I am not capable of the work and I get fired!\). Anyways, scroll through a few weeks and I had an interview in another country. I flew in quite anxious and standing outside the building, smoking yet another cigarette \(I know filthy habit!!\) I told myself, ""Whats the worst that can happen. The reason I got a callback is because these guys clearly think I'm good enough and want to see what I'm about."" So I went in, aced the interview and got the job. After a few weeks into the job, I realized that the people who work there are absolutely incompetent and lazy and all sorts of things and that made me feel much better about myself. Made the work very pleasant actually, going in and knowing that if these guys are still working here, then heck I'm sorted for life :\) 

I'm not saying that it will be the same scenario for you, but what I will suggest is that if you apply for an internship and you get invited for an interview, you've already done the hard part. These guys see the potential in you and you need to go out there and show them what you're capable off.

It’s hard for many people to understand the feeling.

And these types of advice come from people who see depression or anxiety as something ‘alien’ or a symbol of ‘weakness’

Ben2ek,1328206588.0,,,,,,,,t2_6tlm9,"As a college grad, it's mentally draining to just throw your resume into the black hole that is every job board. But like you said, something WILL happen. 1 week is nothing in the corporate world. The job application window may not close for a job rec for a month or longer depending on how fast the company moves or how quickly they need someone in the job. If you don't hear back from a job within 3\-4 weeks, then you can consider it a bust. I've heard back as soon as the same day and as long as 3 months \(I barely remembered applying to that one\), but most are within a few weeks.

That said, here's some long\-winded job search advice from someone who's gone through quite a few job searches over the last 8 or so years:

Have some more people look over your resume, you never know what they may find or what suggestions they have \(typos kill resumes, period\). Make it simple to read, no crazy fonts/lines/formatting/etc. Ask to look at your friends' resumes and compare styles and see if yours is too over the top. Add your LinkedIn, GitHub, or portfolio link directly to your resume. Make yourself as appealing as possible. Beef up your work/internship/volunteer experience descriptions with buzz words that are listed in the job description because if you're applying to large corporations you need to get back the first automated filter that searches your resume for key words \(i.e. company values, bolded words, desired skills, etc\). Yes, that means creating multiple customized resumes for the more specific jobs. LinkedIn job search and many other boards have an ""Easy Apply"" button. Use it to your advantage for jobs that don't give a lot of substance to go off of and mass apply to jobs \(best part is that it keeps track of the jobs you applied to and their descriptions so you can reference it when you get a call\-back\).

Keep a running list of jobs you applied to \(use Excel or whatever you like\). Create automatic labels in Gmail that label jobs from all the sites you've applied from ""Job\-Applied"" so you can easily search for the job number or description later. If you don't get an automatic email with the job description, send an email to yourself with it so you don't lose it. The worst is when you get a call and you can't find the description anymore and the job posting is removed. You're shit out of luck and have to go purely off memory, which is terrible because you probably blindly applied to that job 3 weeks ago. Diligence in tracking your applications pays off.

Search you target industry with a few buzz words, for example if you're looking in the finance field search ""finance analyst"", ""finance data"", ""finance accounting"", finance business"",  and so on. Don't try to search for specific job titles \(this was my down fall\), the job titles will appear with those searches. Filter for smaller companies, they're more likely to actually look at your resume instead of it getting filtered by an automated system.

Write your cover letter with personality. Write it like you would speak to someone, then go back and edit for professionalism/grammar. The way your mind writes and how you talk are completely different, see which one sounds better.

Entry level jobs are a dime\-a\-dozen, so just keep your spirits up. You'll get a hit soon, and then all of a sudden you'll have 5 opportunities to choose from. The old saying ""when it rains, it pours"" has held true during all 3 of my big job searches.",True,,,0.0,1526589225,,0.0,dz5ffcy,False,t3_8k4fsl,2.0,False,t1_dz4s7mm,/r/Anxiety/comments/8k4fsl/job_search_anxiety/dz5ffcy/,20666.0,1527637549,6,True,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,,public,,,False,1526589604.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At first it took over on a weekly basis, then daily. Now it’s slacking off a bit and I’ve been okay for three weeks without any attacks or too much anxiety. But we have been together since 2013 and my anxiety actually led to us breaking up early on because I was experiencing  depersonalization. I thought it was because I didn’t want to be with him (I felt numb) but he was my friend through the whole ordeal while I sorted it out and realized it wasn’t him, it was my anxiety. So he has experienced the worst of it with me :) the fact that she and you can both recognize it’s her anxiety will keep you from making the mistake I did by thinking I needed to end our relationship instead of working through things. It’s good that you don’t take things personally. I didn’t realize my anxiety manifested in anger at first so I spent a lot of time being angry at him and wishing he would do X or Y until I realized that I had been in a bad mood for about 3 months straight. Obviously it wasn’t him if I was angry regardless of day, time or situation so I needed to get a handle on myself. Not gonna lie, Zoloft has been incredibly helpful so far. Therapy is important, too, but it’s not something you can do for her. She has to be willing and seek help herself or it won’t work. 
Feel free to pm me if you have any other questions! I have learned a lot about being in a relationship and having anxiety in the past few years and I am happy to ask my husband if you have any questions specifically for him on the other side of things. He struggles with depression so we definitely are no strangers to mental health and we always love to help others. Something good can come of what we have been through if we can give back.

coloumb,1344913715.0,,,,,GAD/Citalopram,,,,"There are a couple of ways to taper off.  However, to try and reduce the withdrawals you'll want to taper off as slow as possible [could take a few months up to a year or more]

1. 10% dose reduction from your previous dose and take that for 3 weeks.  Repeat until you get to 0.  This tends to have the least amount of withdrawals but obviously takes a very long time.  For accuracy - you'll want to take the liquid form of Celexa.  Tons of information about slowly tapering off Celexa here:

http://survivingantidepressants.org/topic/2023-tips-for-tapering-off-celexa-citalopram/

2. Alternate the dose for a week and than take the lower dose for ~3 weeks.  20/17.5/20/17.5/20/17.5 and then take 17.5 for ~3 weeks.  If you feel OK after 3 weeks, reduce by 2.5 and alternate again.  Repeat this until you hit 0.  This is easier than option #1 and has an increased chance of withdrawal side effects.  

In both cases - listen to your body and be prepared to go back up to the previous dose if the withdrawals are too much to handle.

The feeling of the unknown like are friends going to go to college? Are you going to college? Will you still continue to work part time/go to school or work full time for a little bit.

For the most part from birth to high school we follow a pretty  linear path, but when we graduate everything opens it up and that freedom, all the choice and possibility can seem massively overwhelming. It can feel even worse if your unsure of what you want/should do.

Talking to a school counselor or a teacher might help, but I also could have red too much into this. It could be pro longed anxiety, which can lead into a panic attack when the emotions get to a boiling point. Your heart races, breathing becomes rapid and you become extremely aware  of your own breathe. you can begin to tremble and sweat profusely. It could also mean a prolonged feeling of fear and anxiety.

It definitely sounds like a form of anxiety/panic though, so talking to a counselor or family doctor would likely help bring clarity into the situation.",,,,,1513903127,,,drlhh6g,,t3_7lahr2,,,t3_7lahr2,/r/Anxiety/comments/7lahr2/constant_dread_around_everything/drlhh6g/,,1513904029,1,,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,,,,,,,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",1513904029.0,,,,,,,,,,

She had to be hospitalized because soon it escalated and she started acting on her beliefs (like barging in on neighbors because she was convinced her ex was there to torment her)

I don’t know if that’s happening to you, but in the off chance that it might, you might want to stay near friends just in case it happens to you and you’re unaware of it.

They’re just thoughts, not real. Our brains may naturally want to think or over analyze, which is ok. We can just return to the present moment over and over.

Job stress is huge.  I have been in one of those jobs--it saps the energy out of life--no doubt.  Even in a dying ecoomy there are things you can do.  

First definitely look for another job.  Your English appears good enough you may find work with a contracting company either with a telecommute or relocation.    You can get a lot of rejections but focus on the search, more than the results--I found X number of jobs and applied today...etc.

Second, and again, I don't know bankrupcy in Brazil, but it is JUST MONEY.  Work with your creditors.

#How to Decode Someone With Anxiety

##### **Things we are trying to do all the time:**

* Be safe
* Not worry
* Worry if we're really worried or if our mind is playing tricks on us
* Worry that we should be worried but are trying to ""be calm""
* Worry that others are going to notice this worry loop in our heads
* Wash, rinse, repeat and add more worries


##### **Things we can’t help but do all the time:**
    
* second-guess ourselves
* behave impulsively and re-actively
* take everything personally
* worry
* have difficulty accepting compliments
*  have difficulty reciprocating friendly gestures
* worry
* have difficulty finding the courage to respond
* have difficulty not being suspicious of others’ intentions
* worry
* make a huge deal out of the smallest thing
* think we're bothering you

    

##### **Things you should keep in mind:**
    
* we’re scared of everything
* pretty much all of the time
* it’s an actual disorder
* it manifests as impulsive behavior
* you can’t fix us with words
* *telling us “worrying is silly” won’t make us stop worrying*
* it’ll only make us feel silly
* and then we’ll worry even more
* “oh god, am i worrying too much? what if they call me silly again?”
* like that
* also, we wear a lot of armor - cold, heavy, affection-proof armor- with spikes   
* we constructed this armor as children   
* we’re fairly certain you will never be able to pry it apart   
but there is a nice person under there, we promise

-----

#### **Things you can do for a friend with an anxiety disorder:**

* stick around
* ask them if they’re comfortable in a place or situation
* be willing to change the place or situation if not
* activities that help them take their mind off of things are good!
* talk to them even when they might not talk back (they’re probably too afraid to say the wrong thing)
* try not to take their reactions (or lack thereof) personally (the way they expresses themselves is distorted and bent because of their constant fear) (and they know this)
* give them time to respond to you
* they will obsess over how they are being interpreted
* they will anticipate being judged
* it took me four hours just to type this much
* even though i sound casual
* that’s because i have an anxiety disorder    
    

##### **Things you shouldn't do:**
      
* tell us not to worry
* tell us we’ll be fine
* mistake praise for comfort
* ask us if we are “getting help”
* force us to be social
* force us to do things that trigger us
* “face your fears” doesn't always work
* because—remember—scared of everything
* in fact, it would be more accurate to say we are scared of the fear itself    
    

##### **Emergency action procedure for panic attacks:**
      
* be calm
* be patient
* don’t be condescending
* remind us that we’re not “crazy”
* sit with us
* ask us to tighten and relax our muscles one by one
* remind us that we are breathing
* engage us in a discussion (if we can talk, then we can breathe)
* if we are having trouble breathing, try getting us to exhale slowly
* (it will be harder for us to exhale than inhale)
* (sometimes all it takes is our body to realize it can push the air back out)
* or breathe through our nose
* or have us put our hands on our stomach to feel each breath
* or have us put a hand on your chest and breath with you
* ask us what needs to change in our environment in order for us to feel safe
* help us change it
   
---
          
*Usually, just knowing that we have someone on our side willing to fight our scary monsters with us is enough to calm us down*
   
---

##### **If you have an anxiety disorder:**
    
* it’s okay.
* even if you worry that it’s not okay.
* it’s still okay. it’s okay to be scared. it’s okay to be scared of being scared.
* you are not crazy. you are not a freak.
* I know there’s a person under all that armor.
* and i know you feel isolated because of it.
* I won’t make you take it off.
* but know that you are not alone.

I know i really needed those couple of years of structure and time (which felt like i was working towards something and had purpose) to grow.

Forgetting about the whole college thing, take your time and find something you want to do to get a bit of confidence (and remember you are 25 now so you don't have to commit to anything, if you go to a exercise group etc you can just leave if you want, your not stuck).

ri0tnrrd,1152082395.0,,,,,All The Anxieties,,,,"To add on to what /u/Venixflytrap had to say (great advice btw!) You may want to look into reaching out either to a shelter, or maybe to a service dog training place. Explain your situation and ask if you could maybe come by and either 'volunteer' (more so if you can contact service dog training place). Service dogs are trained to be very calm, emotionally supportive, and non-aggressive. Maybe by at first getting calming non-threatening experiences associated with dogs it could slowly help with the phobia.   

I was attacked by a dog when I was say 13 or so. Scars up and down my right arm and in my head for years, and it pretty much traumatized me. I would freeze up even hearing dog bark, or being near one just gave me so much anxiety. Then about 5 or 6 years ago a friend of mine got a pit bull puppy and omg she was so tiny and so non-threatening. With the friend working way too much I ended up puppy sitting for days on end and before I knew it my fear had dramatically been reduced. As the pit bull puppy got older, bigger, stronger, I had no fear of her what so ever. Granted my experience is my own, but wanted to share as an example.

I have been diagnosed with MDD recurrent, and was getting counseling for about two years. I am mostly resistant to medication and have had to discontinue therapy after changes in my employers healthcare policy.

Recently, I’ve also noticed a significant stammer/stutter. I’ve heard it’s rare for this to develop in adults (Im 32, and this has only presented in the last six months)

I’ve not been diagnosed with GAD, but my last counselor suggested that I may need to look into it. Unfortunately, most psychiatrists/psychologists available to me don’t have a sliding pay scale that I can afford.

Can I get your thoughts on the insurance system in the US? I know somebody who suffers from depression/anxiety and its a nightmare for her to find psychiatrists/therapists if you go through insurance. 

Over half the doctors on the insurance plan won't bother answering or returning your calls/emails because they are too busy. The ones that do answer, most of them sound interested in setting up an appointment, but when they learn you want to go through their insurance rather than pay cash, they tell you they are booked and to try back in 2 months. The ones that do accept you as a new patient don't offer therapist services, just want to see you for 10 minutes then rush you out of the office and one your way with a prescription.

The good doctors are in high demand and don't use insurance and charge high rates. She can get an insurance plan that lets her see out of network doctors, of course the help given by insurance is still pretty crappy. Insurance will say they will pay for half, but in reality only pay half the ""reasonable"" rate. The ""reasonable"" rate being ridiculously low and the patient will pay for the lionshare of the bill and not half. And the monthly insurance premium for this type of plan is high to begin with.

What kind of options does a person have to find a good doctor? Is there any good insurance plan out there in Southern California?

I guess I might as well ask, but is there any recommendation one of you doctors can give me for a psychiatrist or therapist (or ideally one that does both or works in a team with another doctor) in the Los Angeles CA area? If so please PM me.

2. This is an interesting question. I heard some good things about hypnosis but can't speak much about it as I don't know it so well. The other things that you can try is replacing these behaviors. First, you can become aware of them and see the triggers that lead to them. Then, you can try to do some breathing, grounding, etc. You can also do something else that will help you preserve your cuticles and teeth. You can doodle, play with a squishy ball, etc.

Daniela-P-Counseling,,,,,,Verified | Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist,,,,"This is a really interesting question and while I cannot speak to the medical condition you are describing, I can offer some thoughts about the pain symptoms you are having. While I do not have your specific condition, I do have health and pain conditions so I have expanded my knowledge about the psychology and biology of pain so this is where I am coming from when I share these thoughts :)

When someone is under emotional stress, their stress hormones increase, heart rate increases, breath quickens and muscles become more tense.  When the body tenses up, the intensity of pain in the body can also increase because the muscles are rigid.  If a person was to rate their pain on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the most painful) they would likely rate that pain higher.  Now if that same person used some relaxation practices to promote a reduction in muscle tension, then that pain intensity can be less and if they self rated it, that number may be lower.  

I can also share that having a medical condition where there can be flare ups that show up unexpectedly, can absolutely contribute to feeling anxious and having panic attacks.  This pattern can lead to thoughts and beliefs getting reinforced which can then make the symptoms become worse.  So this is where working with a therapist (like you have mentioned you have been doing which is great!) specifically to learn how to offset that anxiety by adding in more self care and mindfulness practices can make a difference.  There are a couple approaches I like to use with clients who have similar medical anxiety experiences and those are Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Tapping (also called Emotional Freedom Technique).  Tapping can be done on oneself for moments when they notice their stress in increasing.  In case you are not familiar with tapping I will include a link here which is an example of tapping to address anxiety.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3dO76Fl4aI   Please let me know if you have any questions!",True,,,0.0,1515711504,,0.0,dsjl7pg,False,t3_7poipc,2.0,,t1_dsj4wmu,/r/Anxiety/comments/7poipc/we_are_licensed_mental_health_professionals_here/dsjl7pg/,15685.0,1517802619,1,,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,,public,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am envious of others and their attitudes about mistakes. I can laugh about mistakes too, but inside I'm taking myself way too seriously. I'm very embarrassed of everything.

Quorton,1415137167.0,,,,,,,,t2_j7bzp,"First of all, I could do it because of a deep trust between me and the therapist, it would obviously not work without it (and should not be even attempted without it but any responsable therapist will hopefully know this).




I personally was impressed by two main aspects:


 - The first one was that while I was doing this therapy up to 3-4 times in a week, I had a big motivational push. I had the feeling I really was going deep into myself every time and it felt like hard work with a clear purpose and also with quite quick rewards. I never had the feeling of wasting time, every session was a net win. The whole experience felt very empowering despite the idea behind it is to lower defences.



 - The second one is more retrospective (I stopped the therapy 6 months ago because of external reasons and it is very hard to find another therapist of this type in Germany where I now live). I really developped a more acceptig relation with my emotions. Because of the very intense experiences with deep strong emotions, I now have the feeling of understanding them more. I recognise them, identify them, decide to show them, or not. I notice fear and anxiety rising and try to dig around what triggers did that and if there are not other emotions around. When in one hour I go from a ridiculous bloodthirsty anger to tragic sadness and then deep forgiving love, well, those triggers every day seem quite petty and are easier to cope with.




Of course due to the short time with the therapy it could only work as a solid strong basis for me to now do the year long work on myself, but I am confident to be able to maybe even achieve complete freedom from anxiety after years of every day trainig.



This experience actually even changed my religious affinity and attitude to life.



Sorry for any mistakes, I am not a native speaker.

If this is severe enough to hinder your life functioning, I would suggest seeking help. You don't want this to affect your work, school, or relationships. 

Meanwhile, you can position yourself as an observer of your thoughts and thus create a degree of separation from them. You can practice mindfulness by doing a body scan, and observe your breathing and thoughts. You can notice, ""Hm, I think I'm going crazy. OK. That's interesting.""

If someone is experiencing that level of distress then seeing a therapist could be really helpful.  And perhaps seeking out counseling for yourself can help you too because that can be a lot for a spouse to manage.  

Aside from a person going to a therapist's office for sessions, there are some other options such as online counseling or at home visits.  With online counseling, the client and therapist see each other on the computer in a Skype like set up.  This can help those with anxiety because they are still in the comfort of their own home and in a space where they feel safe.

abzdillah,1464724310.0,,,,,GAD (Generally Awesome Dude),,,t2_ycrxu,"The risk of infection is incredibly low, even if you have unprotected sex.

&gt; First, HIV is a very difficult virus to transmit sexually. Based on a number of studies, the average frequency of transmission is between 1 in 1000-2000 episodes of unprotected vaginal sex, IF the partner is infected, with somewhat higher frequency from male to female. Under certain circumstances, there are other risk factors that may come into play such as viral load, concurrent STDs, etc., that may increase this risk, but for most people the 1 in 1000-2000 statistic applies.

&gt; Second, in North America, most heterosexuals do not have HIV.  Unless someone lives in an HIV endemic area such as an inner city, is an immigrant from a country with high HIV prevalence, is bisexual or a partner of a bisexual, or is an injection drug user or commercial sex worker, the prevalence of HIV in people without these risk factors is extremely low- less than 1 in 1000 people. Even in commercial sex workers, the incidence is less than 1 in 100, with most infections in 'street walkers' who use narcotics; the prevalence in high class call girls and escorts is no different than the rest of the population.

&gt; A person’s HIV risk is a product of the frequency of transmission for the particular sex act and the odds that the partner was infected. This means that unless your partner had any of the aforementioned risk factors, the chance of getting infected from a single episode of unprotected sex is 1 in a MILLION!

dalilajl,,,,,,Verified | Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist,,,,"Hi celestiamatch, 

These are severe forms of dissociation. It happens when we get triggered and our system goes out of the ""window of tolerance."" This is the term used to describe when we feel Ok. We can be happy, sad, or anything else, but we are present and aware of what's going on around us. 

This usually happens due to severe trauma that we've suffered from. They are actually symptoms of PTSD and dissociative disorders in general. 
Just like other trauma symptoms they can be treated by some trauma-focused treatment. I personally like Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, which utilizes Somatic approach along with CBT and psychodynamic based treatment for attachment issues. 

I wouldn't judge them as poor coping mechanisms. The person who was abused used them to minimize the experience of trauma. They served this person when they needed it. Now, these symptoms may hinder a person if they want to grow in life. Thus it would be good to address these symptoms and try to figure out how to replace them with other coping strategies that will help the person grow.

I haven't been diagnosed with any particular anxiety disorder, but it runs in both sides of my family so I definitely know that I have it. Social anxiety affects me the worst. It usually kicks in when I'm in a crowded place surrounded by unfamiliar people and it's happened everywhere from small bars to a convention with tens of thousands of people to a dinner banquet I went to last year for a family graduation. It starts off as a feeling of ""I really don't want to be here"", so I try to remove myself to a more quiet area. Obviously that's not always possible. Then it gets stronger and manifests into me not being able to talk without bursting into tears and going into an panic-induced asthma attack. I usually can't even make myself move during these attacks and have sat in the same spot without moving or saying anything for up to an hour before it actually gets to the point of crying and the asthma attack.

One aspect that makes my anxiety so debilitating at times is that I have trouble talking to people about how I feel. More specifically, when I'm anxious I have a hard time talking about my fears because I feel like having my fears or emotions out in the open and having someone fuss over me will just make me more anxious. And as a result I bottle up a lot of my emotions, and I often feel kind of frozen in place at times.

wtw4,1326166053.0,,,,,,,,t2_6mjk0,"When you develop anxiety, you naturally try to avoid it in the future. We think that if we plan things out or pay attention, we can see things coming and get out of the way.

It doesn't work that way. In fact it's even more harmful. It's the same some veterans and cops, who enter a room and automatically search for exits and possible threats, enterering a constant focus.

I recommend reading about Zen Buddhism, I like anything by Alan Watts. Zen teaches you not to plan, but to react. If I say I'm going to throw a ball to you, you will have thoughts about catching it, maybe dropping it and looking foolish, etc. If I just toss it to you without telling you, the result is the same - you catch it or you don't, but you skip the anxiety. Trust that whatever problem comes at you, you will deal with appropriately. After all, you have survived every issue that you've experienced. Practice reacting and eventually you will build  confidence in your ability to cope, and realize that we usually act in the same way we would if we planned for it.",True,,,0.0,1515709610,,0.0,dsjjclj,False,t3_7pqy9t,1.0,,t3_7pqy9t,/r/Anxiety/comments/7pqy9t/perceiving_danger_absolutely_everywhere/dsjjclj/,7702.0,1517801632,1,,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,,public,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dalilajl,,,,,,Verified | Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist,,,,"Hi Quorton, 

A beautiful thing about therapy is that there are so many modalities that are helpful in different situations for different people. I'm not so familiar with it, but my personal concern is that people who have anxiety or trauma will feel pressured to release defenses, which helped them survive adverse experiences. 

I prefer to empower my clients to make personal choices and decisions when they are ready to let go of defenses. They are there for a reason. 
Hope this helps. What do you like about it? ",True,,,0.0,1515709325,,0.0,dsjj28k,False,t3_7poipc,2.0,,t1_dsj4o9l,/r/Anxiety/comments/7poipc/we_are_licensed_mental_health_professionals_here/dsjj28k/,13723.0,1517801474,2,,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,,public,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Daniela-P-Counseling,,,,,,Verified | Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist,,,,"Hi there iameastinglotsoftime.  Thank you for asking this question.  So I see you saying that you think you have Exploding Head Syndrome.  This is not something I am familiar with (sorry about that) but I am wondering if you have talked with a doctor and gotten a formal diagnosis?  I looked it up just now and it does not seem like doctors know enough about what causes it but one hypotheses is that it could be triggered by stress.  Since I am not a medical doctor I cannot really give you and answer, and even if I were a doctor, there sadly does not seem to be enough information about how to treat it and what causes it.  

If you have GAD then working on ways to manage stress would be helpful and that practice can take many shapes with a variety of mindfulness exercises.  Some ideas could be going for a walk outdoors, practicing yoga, writing in a journal, doing some artwork and starting a gratitude practice.  All of these help in calming down the nervous system and helps the body to be in a more relaxed state and allows the body put its energy into healing and restoring itself.  

Being a therapist can absolutely be stressful at times but it also is really rewarding work because we get to help people get on a path to leading more fulfilling lives.  We get to see the positive changes take shape and the best compliment is when they no longer need to come in for therapy.

When I am stressed though, I go outdoors into nature, breathing in the fresh air, and enjoy a nice walk. I also like going to the beach where I listen to the ocean waves and sit on the sand.  I just set some time for myself and practice deep belly breathing, use tapping on myself and do some light stretching to feel refreshed to go on with my day.  I also see my own therapist and that helps too!

What I find most interesting about psychology is that the field is continuing to evolve and there is always more to learn.  I love learning about the brain, neuroplasticity and about how the body and brain can be supported so that changes for the better can be made.  The concept of intergenerational trauma, and the mind-body connection are areas I am really interested in learning more about right now.  Functional medicine is also really interesting for me and learning about how that can play a role in mental health is fascinating.",True,,,0.0,1515709193,,0.0,dsjixjh,False,t3_7poipc,2.0,,t1_dsj29od,/r/Anxiety/comments/7poipc/we_are_licensed_mental_health_professionals_here/dsjixjh/,15867.0,1517801411,2,,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,,public,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OakleyOakum,1481416073.0,,,,,,,,t2_13h13a,"People don't generally want to consider it, but it matters what we put in our bodies. I feel my best when I'm on a whole foods ""diet"" as well. Convenience food, although it makes me sick and isn't even nearly as satisfying as real food, is a vicious cycle that's hard to break.

I'm working on cutting out alcohol right now, as I try to eat better again as well. Crossing my fingers to end this cycle. 

I find that it makes people angry though, when you tell them they can make themselves feel better when they change the way they eat. It's hard to admit that you're doing something that is actively contributing to your depression/anxiety. ""If only it was that easy."" Maybe it isn't for everyone, but it's worth a damn try.

Great work OP. Keep at it, and remember this feeling.

DrJanaScrivani,1477659209.0,,,,,Verified | Licensed Psychologist,,,t2_12fqb9,"Hi there!  I'm so glad that you posted your question again!  This is a really common fear for folks both starting talk therapy, and medication treatment, that lowering their anxiety will adversely impact their academic performance, or their ability to make good decisions, keep themselves safe, etc.  There is actually an optimal level of anxiety that does help us with performance, but that's in small amounts, in larger amounts, anxiety hurts performance.  The goal of any good treatment, whether it's medication or talk therapy is not to eliminate your natural, helpful anxiety, but to decrease the anxiety that's not helpful and is interfering in your ability to be successful.  Good luck with everything, and I hope you find a treatment that suits you!",True,,,0.0,1515708987,,0.0,dsjipyd,False,t3_7poipc,2.0,,t1_dsjc57p,/r/Anxiety/comments/7poipc/we_are_licensed_mental_health_professionals_here/dsjipyd/,6268.0,1517801298,3,,False,Anxiety,t5_2qmij,,public,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
