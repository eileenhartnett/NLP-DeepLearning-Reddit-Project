PunkRockMaestro,,,[],,,,text,t2_zqzi0,False,"ocd can be a feature or comorbid of bipolar and that's what rigid demands sometimes are based in. Often times personality defects and poor ability to question oneself due to overactive ego protection mechanisms get amplified by a mood disorder, so all his bros are wigging out because of the nonsense he is spewing, but normally if he wasn't disordered, he would be checking himself, so the event and vandalism bit and the display of this stuff, overshadows the simple fact that his brain is on repeat like a scratched dish. Why I'm telling you this is that this builds up from a long time, and his reactive mode has dwarfed his self reflective mode, and now it's too late, what his friends tell him will not make sense, simply on the amount of neurons firing. The only thing that works for that is therapy. Specifically cognitive behavioral therapy. If I were you from this list I would select CBT for Bipolar 2nd edition - Basco, it contains the most relevant issue for trying to reprgram this guy's brain. You need to put together some kind of sales pitch. Like, sit down with him with a computer and show him the science behind cbt and the evidence of cognitive neuroscience like his prefrontal cortex overpowering his limbic brain, and why these procedures will work.

When I say happy I use the term interchangeably with mentally healthy.

They're happy by default when there are no problems. Even better, they have a tangible drive to solve them. If this weren't the case, everyone'd be like me and there'd be euthanasia for sure. (Life really would be meaningless, for everyone, not just the mentally ill.)

Mentally healthy people have resilience, an innate desire to live and interact with others as well as overcome challenges. I suspect they also have an easier time thinking, reading and writing than I do. (It took me over 50 minutes to write this whole comment.) I recognize these characteristics: resilience, desire, passion and extroversion etc. in myself when I'm not empty/distracted/suicidal. (Those are my main three states.) I trust you when you say everyone has problems. My dad's struggling immensely with his business. I've asked him if he's ever considered suicide, and he said he did once when he was on a plane. He thought it'd be easier if the plane crashed and we all died. He quickly snapped out of it though. He has the financial weight of having to support a family of four. See with me I haven't even gotten that far and frankly don't really want to because I've wanted to kill myself countless times already. That's the difference between having problems and being mentally ill. I decided in school that I wasn't going to have kids in case they end up going through the subtle but extreme hell I do. I also wouldn't be able to handle a family because I consistently lose every good habit/interest I gain and have to start again and again.",1584675695,{},fkzo3j4,False,t3_flezj4,True,t1_fkzjim6,/r/bipolar/comments/flezj4/given_the_chance_would_you_eternal_sunshine_of/fkzo3j4/,1584679401,1,True,False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,,[],,False,[],,False,0.0,1584677149.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I work in research and plan on doing mental health research as a career because I am extremely passionate about it for obvious reasons - I empathize with people who struggle with mental illnesses as I have and do struggle with it myself and can't imagine anything worse than what I experience when I am having an episode, its complete hell, or what I would imagine it would be like if there was one - wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. I am digressing from the point but I am really just trying to say I still have not emotionally come to terms with my chronic illness, logically I have, its pretty fucking impossible to deny it but emotionally I thought I accepted it but have not and get excited when I see shit like this that may have some validity to it.  


The real sad thing is this is posted on a board-certified psychiatrist's website [https://kellybroganmd.com/about/bio/](https://kellybroganmd.com/about/bio/) who not only runs a private practice (and am afraid of slander laws n shit - idk how this works but to me it looks like shes just in it for the money, look at how her website is set up and the way she runs her practice) but what is even scarier is that she is on staff at NYU med school as a clinical professor. She is not only mistreating patients herself but training future clinicians to not use proven and effective treatments that as it stands are the only form of effective treatments (aside from some Deep Brain Stimulation or Electroconvulsive Therapy that still need to be fine-tuned).   


Pills/medicine, as much as I don't want to admit it, have saved my life and kept me stable when I otherwise probably would not have been. Yes, I still have episodes but unfortunately its the best we got at the moment and as someone said we are lucky to live in a time where it is available because they would be a lot more frequent without. I would also have most likely been institutionalized in the not too distant past.   


I hope there will be better treatments in the future when the pathologies are better known and understood but until then to not only mislead people with real biological illnesses is f'ed.

crazyausachick,,,,,,,,t2_106tdx,,"I started having panic attacks for the first time last year, due to ptsd. And I had them at work- like once I was interviewing a director and a panic attack  hit me and sweat came pouring down my face and I so desperately wanted to flee.... it was obvious something was wrong. For some reason i stayed in the room and got through it. And I still see this person and I’m still embarrassed, i can’t imagine what he must have been thinking lol. I also had one in front of a former boss of mine with the same physical reaction. He just kept on talking while I just kept on sweating and breathing and trying not to flee until I calmed down and it passed. Having someone not make a big deal out of it was helpful. 

Ive about 9 or 10 others at work, sometimes I have had to leave work and go home and other times I’ve been able to  ride them out or just leave the room to calm down somewhere else. My job also requires a lot of presenting and my current boss and I have a system where if I’m about to panic, she knows to cover for me if I leave the room abruptly and I also have a sign to give each her that lets her know she needs to take over.

This year my panic is not as bad, I’ve had a few but I have a system now and know the signs that generally indicate the likelihood of a panic attack coming. I take a beta blocker to help manage the physical symptoms as I noticed that if can have those managed early, I am far less likely to spiral into a full blown attack. 

Anyway, sorry this got long.... I just know what it feels like to panic at work in front of your boss.

Below are some cognitive functions observed in bipolar disorder. I found these in scientific studies that on substances that might help fight impaired cognition in bipolar: 

* verbal memory - remembering words, lists, word associations 
* long-term memory
* information processing
* reasoning 
* inhibitory control - self control 
* cognitive flexibility - ability to think about two or more concepts at once
* problem solving
* planning
* attention
* social cognition - storing, processing, and using information about people and situations
* psychomotor speed - reaction time while doing a task that includes processing information 

Note: some of the functions listed above are ""[executive functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions).""

kybp1,,darkgoldenrod,,,Bipolar 1,,,t2_qvgku,,"Yes, political matters and civic engagement are a normal passion of mine, so for me it's not random. I'm not extreme or incendiary in my political activities, though I am very far too the left. Normally my political and civic engagement is 90% conventional, but I've done some deeply political and ideological yet apparently ""normal"" work for my local government as consultant on matters like food insecurity, urban agriculture, and urban forests. Though politics are a big part of my life and I'm into far left stuff like peaceful anarchism and social theory, I'm mostly collaborative and constructive rather than incendiary and confrontational. 

When I'm manic and I start wanting to take on the police in particular, it's partly because I've had some extremely negative manic experiences with local cops that, due to their improper escalation of a noncriminal and harmless manic situation I was in, left me with a pattern of having panic attacks around first responders. So when I'm manic I get angry at the police for their actions, I get angry at the panic attacks themselves, and my irritability warps and exaggerates my usual feelings and political positions re: policing. 

With general political matters, it's just an escalation and distortion of my usual political positions combined with some grandiose delusions and a dash of mystical delusion. This mostly implicates specific issues/problems that normally occupy my time/thoughts/etc. I just start believing I have a bunch of easy solutions or formulas for progress on those issues. I've actually had a couple meetings with local government officials while following these delusions, and a couple have been actually productive for all involved, though in the end nothing really came of them. Other people have bought into my thinking/projects, probably because of manic charisma. These things are nearly always embarrassing in retrospect and I'm afraid that sometime these will have very bad consequences. But I should say that I never do anything criminal, mean, or disruptive.

Second, here’s a couple of things that have helped me tons:

A) Throw away the words, “good” and “bad”. They cause us to judge everything we do in a moral way and we then end up hating ourselves because we judge ourselves so harshly. That leads us to all sorts of ideation and over thinking, anxiety, etc. because our analytical mind won’t let it go. Instead, look at your thoughts, actions, moods, etc. as “healthy” or “unhealthy”. Those words are morally neutral. You can then look at something objectively and adjudge it as one or the other and then rationally begin to take steps to diminish unhealthy behaviors and increase healthier ones without the crippling self loathing.

B) What happens is that our analytical mind is trying to fix hurtful past situations or predict future disasters. You’ve heard of overthinking something...this is that. The analytical mind gets going like an out of control time machine flying back and forth with you inside of it. It’s a churning river of regrets, anxiety, guilt, self hate, shame, all the things that we struggle with. It bates us to jump in and we do without even realizing it. We’re carried away to all of those unhealthy emotions, and we begin to drown.
This is where practicing keeping your mind in the present is so important. Google ACT, (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy). You should find a lot of great tutorials.

My best friend kinda scoffed “Oh yeah, I was diagnosed with bipolar years ago , but I’m just fine.” Until she went off the deep end this year and had to be re-diagnosed, and sure enough it’s still bipolar, just a more unusual expression of it.

It’s kinda like ADHD.  All kids have energy.  All kids need to run outside.  But when you’re around a kid with “real” ADHD it’s a whole ‘nother world. 

For me, the diagnosis just answered SO MANY frustrations I’ve experienced for years, and the idea that there were meds for this (even a lifetime of meds) was a joy, and not a curse.

- Deep breathing and grounding techniques tend to slow my mind down. There are a lot of options out there, but an easy one is stopping and naming 5 or more things you see around you. It keeps me out of my mind for a few moments. 

- distractions. A lot easier said than done, but things like journaling or blogging help distract me from what’s happening. They also help slow my thoughts down enough to put them into words. 

- simply talking to someone, or hell, something. If you can do this, it’s nice to just get it out in the air sometimes.

For one thing, it is my understanding that nearly all psychological disorders have increased in frequency of diagnoses in the past 50 years. And it's not because people are getting sicker. It's because there was a huge stigma and very low awareness regarding mental health. Seen as a deficiency of character, ect. It's likely that a lot of these people simply died off without ever being referred to a professional.

I take great issue with how they glibly dismiss the chemical imbalance theory. While it's not perfect, it's the theory most firmly grounded in science.

Instead, they are in favor of food as medicine and other approaches which have no scientific grounding at all.

Also, where on earth are they getting the idea that it's not inheritable? If you have one parent with bipolar, your chances of developing it are like 6x greater. It's extremely heritable.

I hate all the ""spiritual"" stuff they try to get their reader to swallow. This person obviously has no business talking about bipolar if they can't leave their faith traditions out of it. This actually pisses me off. We bipolar people can, like any suffering and marginalized group of people, be easy targets for snake oil salesmen.

This is tantamount to faith healers preying on senior citizens in nursing homes. Can't wait to hear about the book they ewant me to buy.

Also, would you rather consider yourself to have some faulty neurological processes due to genetics, or be spiritually deficient because you didn't do enough Yoga? It's actually way more insulting, on top of being wrong.

Also, meds save lives. Mine included. Suggesting that you should just use wacky eastern philosophy instead of meds is an actually harmful message to put out there. Especially in a population notorious for going off their meds.

Adept_Artichoke,,,[],,,,text,t2_1k5vix1j,False,"This seems a bit knee-jerk to me. 

I'm pointing out attitudes that scream ""ED"" and ""self hate"". It's merely to educate you about your habits and thought patterns that are seemingly destructive - as you said ""I feel bad when I'm FAT"" . (You said it best yourself.) It sounds like you might feel ashamed when you're not fitting a conventionally thin standard - as society teaches us. 

It would probably be helpful for you to read up on the HAES movement and see if there's a way you can feel good about yourself regardless of where you are weight wise. Even if you were a bigger person, you still deserve to feel self love and not self pity or self shame. Diet culture shames us for being any size except a size two, and there are many doctors that feel the same way. If your body keeps trying to gain, that's a sign that your body may have a higher set point. See this article from the national institute of health on this: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2253845
See the comment: Trying to fit into a size you're not meant to be and look at this in conjunction with set point theory. The new news on nutrition from dietitians themselves are turning to this theory instead of the fatphobic and fear mongering ideas we had about weight before: See dieticians and authors like Haley Goodrich, RD, and more. 

The idea that your aesthetic is more important than mental health isn't a great way to start a mental health focused conversation. 

You can knee jerk again, but just know that these theories are actually the new news in Healthcare. I wish you the best of luck.

Trying to fit yourself into a size you're not meant to be isn't a healthy attitude to have. It's also not a healthy attitude to prioritize aesthetics and how you look over your mental health. I wouldn't trade my mental health for being the most beautiful woman in the world, I'll tell you that now. Mental health always will be more important - as it should be. 

Health does not equal weight, there is new research, see more. Many dietitians are moving towards a HAES (health at every size) model.

One of the greatest obstacles to staying and supporting my spouse was the denial and minimization of the diagnosis.

If it is comparable, then it isn't a big deal - it doesn't justify much effort or commitment to address it.   The turning point in our remaining together was us both understanding how big this is, realizing the extent that it affects us both, and valuing the effort we both contribute.  I couldn't support somebody in denial, and I didn't burden my partner with it being their problem alone to fix.

Comparison to the flu belittles what the partner faces, equating their commitment to someone that would cut and run if they got the flu.  If a partner skips out the moment things got rough, call them out instead of minimizing everybodys' challenges.  

This also minimizes the efforts of those with BP.  My spouse has been 100% on top of treatment for at least four years now.  It would be profoundly  insulting to equate this with the effort to treat the flu.

I agree with everyone who says “you dodged a bullet; they weren’t going to stick around.” When bipolar becomes apparent, that’s when you need to hunker down and support your partner unconditionally. If someone leaves at that point, as painful as it may be, it’s for the best. 

Then comes the really trying part. That person is learning the ups and downs of their partner’s illness. As everyone here knows, it can be mild or it can be very severe. I won’t say that a “good person” will stick around and a “bad person” won’t — because this part is what teaches you the most about yourself. As others have said in this thread; you help as much as you can until you cannot bare the abuse. Many people with bipolar disorder do not abuse their partners. Mine did. I tried my absolute hardest and I reached my cutoff. I don’t know if I’ll ever get over it. But it had to end. 

Many people find partners that are a good match; they can be helpful to those with bipolar while maintaining a healthy relationship. To those couples I say congratulations.

Not only do you have to reconcile with yourself that you are ""less than able"" you also have to reconcile your position with a culture that frowns on freeloaders and stigmatizes people with mental illness.

Oh, and the amount of money you receive as a benefit is a pittance. For most applicants the monthly check is relative to lifetime earnings while employed. There are calculators at ssa.gov to help you figure out what your benefit will be but you will first need to give a detailed history of your earnings (also available at [ssa.gov](https://ssa.gov)).

I'm not certain that your citizenship status would affect your case as it is possible to ""go on the rolls"" as a documented alien.

As for the process:

Your first step would be to consult with a lawyer to learn more about the process.  It's not necessary but it is helpful as the process is daunting and having someone to hold your hand isn't going to hurt.  Many lawyers won't charge a fee until your case is settled and then they will take their cut out of the back-pay you are awarded at your settlement.  Back pay is based on your lifetime earnings and is retroactive to the date that you claim to have become disabled.

You can fill out the SSDI application on line.  I think it took me somewhere close to an hour.  Your lawyer may offer to help with the application and there are some social service organizations  that can help as well if you get overwhelmed.

You're application will likely be denied.  The Social Security Administration (SSA) says that nearly 85% of applicants are denied on the first try.

You can then file an appeal.  Again, some legal council can be beneficial but not necessary.

You'll likely be denied again.

On your third appeal it's generally advised that you get some legal help if you don't already have it.  Your third appeal will be a request for a hearing with a judge where your medical records and doctors recommendations will be used to strengthen your case.  With any luck you get a good judge and start collecting your benefit.

Hope this helps and good luck to you.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  A lot of people want to know if they can work while they are on disability or if they can work while they are waiting for a determination.  There are two answers for that.  Yes, you an work while you are collecting an SSDI check but you are limited to an amount predetermined by the SSA.  In 2019 this amount was $1200/mo.  As far as working while you wait it is generally advised that you don't try to work much as you are trying to convince  a judge that you are \*dis\*abed and if you are pulling 30 hours a week at a job it's hard to make that case.  There is also something known as a Trial Work Period (TWP) but I'm not clear on how that fits in.  Maybe at this point you can see why it is advised to see a lawyer.",1570158092,{},f2dmca2,False,t3_dczvpj,True,t3_dczvpj,/r/bipolar/comments/dczvpj/should_i_apply_for_disability_and_how_do_i_do_it/f2dmca2/,1570165716,1,True,False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,,[],,,[],,False,0.0,1570158713.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,,

Think of it like your meds. We’ve allllll been there where it seemed like a good idea to skip or quit them and then shit unravels and you have that lightbulb moment like, oh I did this didn’t I? 

I treat my ED just like any other symptom of my multiple mental illnesses. Bipolar, PTSD, SAD and try not to internalize it. It’s just something I have to manage like my mood and coping skills. 

The thing that really allowed me to start managing it was that I was using it to cope. For bipolars, we can’t control a lot. But we can control what we eat? That was my problem in a nutshell. And then I realized that if I can control how little I eat, I can also control how much I eat. So I started eating more in the same manner that I usually restricted. Good luck! Every person’s situation is different and I didn’t go into much detail on my ED but maybe something I said will strike a chord with you and you can start to make some positive changes. Feel free to pm me if you ever need to talk! I’ve seen a few ED mentions here and there on this sub but not many. Finding others who can relate is so important to our treatment.

OverthrowYourMasters,,,[],,,,text,t2_36mgalu0,False,"&gt;I just scrolled through like 7 pages of posts to find this picture. It came up on my phone a few days ago and I showed it to my mom and husband, hoping it would help them understand. It didn't seem to.

What were you hoping they would get? How would you know they got it? What we were you hoping they would say?

&gt;When I was first diagnosed with depression 15 years ago, I went on Prozac. I told the doctor that it felt like I could see color again. 

Did the Prozac trigger manic symptoms? Before they realized it was bipolar, when I started citalopram and paroxetine, they gave me mania for about 4-5 days. Maybe that's what was going on with you? Also, sertraline didn't go e me mania, but made me a complete moron. Like I was stoned on marijuana but without any of the pleasure. Just a stupid moron disconnected with life.

&gt; 12 years later I was hospitalized for mania. And yes, everything is beautiful and saturated deeply with color. Sounds bother me. My husband wears keys on his belt, and one of my clues that I'm trending manic is that I can't handle hearing his keys jangle when we are walking together.

I like how we all have a little cue for mania. Mine is that I get so freaking happy about stuff! Like, everything is awesome and I want to go do everything.

&gt;It's not just in the present for me. It's in my *memories.* My depressed memories are almost in black and white. My manic memories are GOING. That's the best word I've been able to come up with for it. It's more than just the super-saturation... it's as if everything has a sheen and is covered in a layer of nano-diamonds, and the sun is always shining brightly and reflecting back off it, even when I'm inside and there is no sun. It's so strange.

I think I know exactly what you're talking about. It's especially noticeable in trees when the wind blows cause all of the leaves are rustling and pointing in slightly different directions, making the shine different for each one. Is that what you see?

&gt;Thanks for posting this.

Here's one example from a review article that covers several forms of psychotherapy specifically for bipolar disorder:

&gt;The first controlled PE \[psychoeducation\] trial, from Peet and Harvery, demonstrated the efficacy of PE in improving patients’ attitudes to and compliance with lithium treatment.   
&gt;  
&gt;The most notable study in group PE was conducted by Colom et al, in which 60 patients each were randomized to PE or control groups. After 21 sessions over a 9-month period, patients in the PE group showed a significant reduction in the time to next relapse, as well as a decrease in depressive symptoms and episodes. A follow-up study showed that these results held even for patients who were fully compliant with lithium treatment, implying that improved medication compliance was not the only explanatory factor.

We will have two more dates, then she leaves. It's been nice though - we agreed that we would just lay all our raw shit out. It's not like it's gonna phase each other anyhow but like... You know how you don't want to come on too strong too fast? Too affectionate and an open book? We're like, no, we're gonna do that. We can't date so we don't need to take that into account. Just be emotional. Cry. Kiss during an orgasm. Shit in front of each other. It's very therapeutic. I'm very sad it's so short lived but, hey, nothing is eternal. Convince me not to get matching tattoos though.

Short lived or not, at least now you learned a lot of things about what you like and what you feel comfortable sharing, it's valuable knowledge a lot of people don't have (including myself). I hope you two have a lot of fun together.

&gt;And my psych is the best. I honestly think going to an lgbtq clinic kind of cracks things open a little. Sure, some are more clinical (and I have stopped seeing a couple people there because of that) but then others are much more in tune with knowing how sex is wrapped up with existence when it's not the default, rarely seen, and statistically less likely to meet someone else to match with... So my very gay bear psych talking to me about my overly emotional but also often sexual lesbian exploits has that context sort of baked in. He talks me down from hypersexuality but hes also not conservative about these things.

I wish there was this kind of clinic around here, but then I don't know if I'd feel comfortable. My psychiatrist is gay but he's the married-with-kids archetype, plus he's among the ""numb"" doctors, too. We don't talk about sex at all. I don't even know how it would go.

wolfgame,,c0c0c0,[],,Lost,dark,text,t2_5drij,,"Been trying to get back on track with my job hunt after my last contract ended about 2 months early because I apparently have anger issues.  This came from a guy who was my superior who pulled me aside and pulled this whole ""we're going to be here when you're done"" song and dance.  This was after I said that his wasting of the two weeks prior by taking his entire department to training without telling me anything and then getting pissed off that the project manager that they requested wasn't free.

So then I'm trying to get the project to decommission some servers that were no longer in use and we needed to handle a portion that I hadn't worked with before and so I poked at it a bit and pulls this whole ""we don't want to mess with production systems"", but no one's using these systems anymore.  I've double confirmed that they're not in use, and I said as much.  And so we go in to the office.

That was six weeks ago, and I took a new job.  New job had me sign a training agreement that was super fucking shady, but I didn't see any other options.  The agreement that I had to sign was that after the training that they would be able to bill me for the training if I didn't accept their first two gigs.

Well the training's a fucking dumpster fire.  It assumes that other training materials have been completed without actually including any references, it's full of contradictory statements, images that contradict their own materials, and spelling and grammar mistakes are all through it.  It's so bad that it wouldn't fly in a middle school English class.

So I take a break from ""training"" to go to the dentist, and as I'm locking up my bike, all of my energy disappears.  I collapse in the middle of the sidewalk and people are looking at me like its some kind of act.  Then someone called an ambulance ... apparently I was turning blue.

On the plus side, I got home and got a call from a recruiter that I was talking to a couple of months ago about a position that I thought was not happening and they're going to try to get me in for an interview next week.

As far as feeling tired and numb after taking medication that can be fairly common. I take latuda which is supposed to stabilize your mood. The highs become less high and the lows less low and you kind of feel stuck in the middle. 

One of the worst things you can do though is suddenly stop taking your medication. Your brain doesn't know how to handle it. A lot of the times you need to taper off psychosis meds. Which means slowly stop it over time. 

Anyways I wish you the best! Good luck.

I’m not a Doctor, so I shouldn’t even guess what all that means.

Once you’ve done this, if they’re still telling you it seems like bipolar you sort of have to accept that. If the treatment they give you helps, then you’ll know for sure.
I wasn’t diagnosed with bipolar at first, and I didn’t believe it for a while once I was, even though I’d been hypomanic before. It wasn’t until I was feeling myself again that I was able to accept that medications intended mostly for bipolar patients were working for me.

I was lucky to find my pdoc by referral from a good friend with Bipolar II. Her practice sees exclusively patients with Bipolar and PTSD. She refers other clients out to colleagues with more expertise in their condition.

If you feel like it is negatively impacting your life, get a second opinion. Also, antidepressants can cause manic symptoms sometimes. I don't know if that applies to you but it might be something to bring up with your pdoc.

I work in healthcare and would never ever disclose to a patient. That’s bad practise and not really ethical in my opinion- it’s too personal.

Personally I disclose if I think it’s relevant or would help someone else. My partner is bipolar II and I’m bipolar I and despite that sounding like a bad idea it works out incredibly well for us.

Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a type of severe skin reaction. Together with toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) it forms a spectrum of disease, with SJS being less severe. Early symptoms include fever and flu-like symptoms. A few days later the skin begins to blister and peel forming painful raw areas.

YemekBebek,,,,,,,,t2_falkb11,,"ME TOO. So much about my life and personality makes sense since accepting my diagnosis and subsequently finding this subreddit! Humor has always been my coping style, so even if (or perhaps because) it often makes my life a nightmare, I’m going to appreciate the laughs where I can. It’s so refreshing to see that I’m not alone in these experiences or personality traits that have made me feel so alien for so long.


My manic spending sprees usually involving spending hundreds at a time on clothing or furniture (help me stop redecorating my house pls) but every now and then shit gets weird. Here’s a couple of recent ones if you want to laugh at me!


- I once bought 20 feline neckties online, and spent probably an hour just manic laughing at the idea of gifting them to all the cats I know, but by the time they arrived I was too embarrassed to admit to having bought them in the first place so I just put them on my own cats, which gave me a solid 30 seconds of enjoyment before they were clawed off. There have been many cat-related spending sprees.


- Oh I recently decided that I like taking baths for the first time in my 25 years of life, so I spent a stupid amount of money on “bath supplies” that would make this new hobby more luxe. I took two baths in one weekend and decided I’m the fucking self-care queen 👸🏻🙄


- I’m going on a backpacking trip in a couple weeks so of course I decided it was necessary to spend hundreds of dollars (perhaps a modest estimate) on the best gear... I’m giving myself a half-pass on this one because I do travel a lot, so they’ll get plenty of use. But still. Do I need the most expensive backpack I can find? Oh and do I need TWO OF THEM?


EDIT: I remembered another big one. I’ve been buying people plane tickets!! *Made elaborate travel plans that you think so-and-so should join you in but they’re not sure if they can swing it financially? That’s okay, because apparently it’s no problem for me!!!!! And I bet they’ll really appreciate it!!* I need to end this habit because it’s really starting to add up haha.

My symptoms were present for as long as I can remember, however the onset of puberty around age 12 was when the craziness really ramped up. Mainly it was out-of-character mania, where I would obsess about things and it was so stressful for me. At 15 I stalked a guy at school for 6 months, then that summer I fell into a deep depression and mom took me to a psychiatrist. Dx with depression and general anxiety. Began anti-depressant treatment which lasted until last year (I'm 27). I've been on a downward spiral since then. SSRI's would give me bouts of happy mania, then I'd crash. Over and over. But my dr never gave me anything else to try, and I just kept hoping the ""bad days"" were over then they'd come back.

The SSRIs caused me to make risky choices (out of character, I was always careful and fearful). I was running around with men 5-7 years older, obsessing over male teachers (attempted to seduce one), smoking/drinking at 16-18 (no idea how I managed to not get raped or murdered), wound up pregnant at 18 because I became convinced I was supposed to have a baby. Married then divorced by 21. 
I promise that I've never been an idiot though my actions suggest it. I'd describe it as I was a puppet and my brain the puppeteer, it controlled me with relentless chemical releases. SSRI's were poison for my already unstable brain but I didn't know it.

I'm 27 now, happily married with 2 kids plus a step-daughter and a husband who helps me through my illness and hasn't given up on me once in the 5 years we've been together. I began lamictal 2 months ago and have felt more ""normal"" than I ever have.

Luckily everything worked out great for me and I'm optimistic most of the time. However, I didn't accomplish the things I wanted to when I was in high school. Dropped out of college. I always imagined myself as having a successful career, not a stay at home mom. I also never formed close friendships since I cut myself off from everyone. When I'm going through a Bad Day I keep thinking about how I've messed up my life in all these ways, but on a Good Day I don't even feel that way in the least. I feel that my illness has lead me to this life, and I'm thankful for it.

Finally just being diagnosed with Bipolar has helped more than anything.

You may not be able to stop it entirely but there are little things that you can do to try and prevent it from getting bad. It’s management at the end of the day because there is no cure. So sleep, eat, refrain from drinking/drugs, (this should help with work and school) and be communicative/build a fallback plan with those that you care for in the case of an uncontrollable episode.

Sleep is 50 times more important than anything else right now. Dark therapy and stop and reverse mania

[https://psycheducation.org/treatment/bipolar-disorder-light-and-darkness/dark-therapy/](https://psycheducation.org/treatment/bipolar-disorder-light-and-darkness/dark-therapy/)

The best way to encourage sleep is to block 100% of the blue light that you are able to, and stay in that environment the whole night. Blue light causes the suppressin of melatonin. So turn down every light to just barely what you need, use red light if you are able, use blue light blockers on your screens with Twilight for phones and f.lux for computers and turn the brightness to 0. I am wearing a special pair of glasses that block 99% of the light, plus all my lights are red. In your bedroom block out all light and tape over the led indicators on any chargers, 0% compared to 5% bright is a huge difference. Laying in the dark as they do in that case study is boring, and can be scary if you are having psychotic symptoms, but having laid in bed all night many a night in the complete darkness, I can tell you that it works. I did some stretching, some muscle relaxation, and asked google home to play me the radio or george carlin, but when I got close to sleep I asked it to play white noise or the ocean. And the next day I was able to go to work. In the old days I just stayed up all night doing random crap and went nuts, for years, I know this works for me. Sleep hygiene experts will tell you to get up and go read until you get sleepy, we're manic that's not going to happen. You have to put yourself in an environment for your circadian to get re entrained the right way. 

There is so much to this stuff that I barely know. You will start to learn by your experience and listening to your body by pursuing the physical effect I am talking about and the way it works for you to induce it. 

The second most important thing is to change your mindset to stop thinking about this as happening to you, and it being real, to minimize the distress that it is causing you. This is like how people get anxious about how they are anxious, and develop an anxiety disorder. You can drive yourself crazy worrying about your crazyiness. Your thoughts going to what you like about yourself, what you want to be in the future, how you wish the world was, that's what you need to focus on identifying with and everything else is like your skin molting or something it's just some gross stuff you're getting rid of. Don't let the feeling of this overwhelm you and cause fear, we do have the technology in the world to help us with stuff!

PunkRockMaestro,,,[],,,,text,t2_zqzi0,False,"While I don't think this is what is causing your depression, in my experience trying to think positive, using affirmations, telling yourself you can control this is actually unhelpful because you're setting impossible expectations that are guaranteed to be broken and thus will for sure cause you to be sad, expectations are like your internal puppy, it has no way to know why the thing is happening, it just knew it was supposed to get a treat and did not and will become despondent. So, my mindset is that, I'm just going to stack the deck in my favor, do everything I can, and the rest is just the rub, the consequences of a vulnerability to having my mood easily entrained. Mood entrainment may have evolved to get more done in the seasons like preparing for the winter or whatever, that's why bipolar is related to circadian, and may be why you are in this crushing low in October. Your sleep is good, what about blue light blocking at night and a light box in the morning and getting into the sun asap in the morning? I wear the 99%+ blue light blocking glasses and they do work. 

Our bias is to think if we do this this and this we get that result, but that's a convenient way for us to think. It helps if you identify yourself with your long-term values and your long-term vision, how you wish things were if you were magical, and I identify with that, and not what happens in the day to day, it's a huge shift that takes time, but its the one that I made that allows me to ride out the mood swings and occasional disturbing symptoms. I know it sounds like I'm saying you have to act like a monk, tolerate suffering, and work far harder than anyone really should have to when there is so much around us that we should be enjoying, but it's also what has worked for me, but that just could be me. I know for sure that you can be a scientist and track everything and develop theories and try new things and listen to your body and go for it when you get a hunch to try something and get things to be slightly more tolerable over time. I have definitely been noticing some weird bipolar depression today with me, the psychotic weird thinking, dissociation, feel high but I quit smoking dope (so much better now) Feel good about my life but feel like crap, like I want to break some things or insult someone looking for an excuse to get into a fight, but I'm just letting these feelings go and just going on with my day, I used to have to watch like 400 youtube videos to get through that. So that is what has worked for me. 

There are 100s of things that can help your depression. Acting like normal people is not what cures bipolar depression in my books. It's going way harder than they do in that direction to compensate. The famous psychiatrist randolph nesse has a part in his book good feelings bad feelings which you should definitely read where a woman who had been in therapy and on meds for decades was at the end of her rope, and said doc I'll try anything. He was going on sabbatical so he said anything? OK run for 1 hour, then walk for 1 hour, every day until you are better or you just can't handle doing that anymore, try it out. And she got better. So, don't give up and think you've tried everything and this is how it is. There is so much more. You could do the Wim Hof method and do cold showers and the deep breathing and that might be a part of it.

You can get to a point where you can minimize the symptoms so they are not so distressing, and also develop a mindset where you can channel that minimum amount of distress into constructive action that both distracts you and keeps your moods from getting entrenced.

Next time you want to blot out the world like that do something the opposite way down the spectrum, like go for a run for 2 hours just running when you can walk a bit, and just completely overwhelm your brain with natural painkillers, it's like the opposite of drinking you feel like absolute shit like you are hungover and want to puke and then later it feels like God squeezed all the puss out of your wounds and cleaned them up and put nuskin over them and slathered the area in novacaine. Or when your thoughts suck really bad, sit down with a pen and paper for two hours and work on all of the thoughts directly with cbt so deep that eventually your brain gets the message and goes ""you know what? I'm so sick of being depressed about this stuff, it's too tiring, it is what it is, and it lets go. So part of you knows that you need a big overwhelming experience but you're doing the most reliable thing you know to kill the pain at any cost. You just have to believe there are other things that work. I was the worst alcoholic, I can't even describe it, and what I'm saying is what worked for me and now I don't drink anymore. I do equally insane shit as waking up and chugging a few beers and drinking several fingers of whiskey before I do anything else, but those things are like, ice baths and running in freezing temperatures with shorts and a t shirt, I had to go full David Goggins, that was the only way. In culture, social value is tied into your reproductive value and it's about what people can get out of you, who cares what anyone else thinks, all you wanted to do was feel good, and only a monster would put you down for seeking that, you must have been really ill. I hope you can eat some avacados soon and feel better and forgive yourself and try other things soon. I'm not in AA but the thing about picking up the phone instead of picking up a drink, it works, get on the phone with someone who will support you.

I hope you keep learning and for your sake that you never need to undergo any of these treatments.

My next appointment is a long time away because my doctor is on vacation and there is not a lot of availability to begin with. My follow up appointments in general are very short. I have previously not had a lot of success purely going to see a psychiatrist in a vacuum. It has helped me immensely to read about mental health issues, and research on my own. Otherwise, I don't think I would have ever been taken seriously. It took me years to even understand the concept of mood instability because my psychiatrist had never mentioned that to me. It was all something I came upon while researching on my own. I know that something is not right with me and it is not just being depressed. So I am looking in to what others have experienced. 

So to re-iterate, I obviously know to see a psychiatrist and have already been doing that for years. I assumed that online forums and articles existed so that people could research on their own and supplement the 15 minute visits with psychiatrists who have so many patients that they barely have time for you. I'm glad that I take time to research and read about other conditions because if I didn't I would be like many others who get the easy diagnosis of depression, and are sent out into the world to live their lives. I find it helpful to hear about what other people are going through and to hear what a condition is like for others.

subwutme,,,[],,,,text,t2_2ap8x3np,False,"Before I start in on another long post, I need to ask, is this too much?

I realize two things, talking with you about this in depth. First, there is some confusion between my delusions and theology. The confusion exists in my mind first and foremost. I try to keep them separate, but the confusion infects any discussion I might have on the subject. That I sometimes find analogies between my old fears and my scholarly interests only adds to the confusion.

The other thing is that I'm not as biblical as I would like to be, talking about these things with you. Forgive me. I use the tools I have at my disposal, and I have to hope some of it is relevant to those who know their Bible better than I do. My major philosophical interests have been sympathetic to Christianity in general, but I don't know how far it goes in terms of a one-to-one mapping with Christian doctrine. The Christian theology I am interested in is active but not in the main stream, lotsa ancient and medieval theology, a little from the 20th century, most of which is process theology. A friend got me to read the first chapter of Barth's Epistle to the Romans. I do not remember content now, but my pencil comment on the front is ""bracing,"" like an ice cold shower.

Joy is a birthright, is it not? Just the raw fact of being alive. We deviate from that (har har), but joy is there, basic. That's how I tend to look at it. Celebrations are an assertion of that fact.

The way I think about theophanies, creation itself is one, and every part of it shares in the self-revelation of divine beauty, you and me too. There are ancient sources for this view. I am not sure how well it squares with current theology. The view may be more Greek than Christian. I know my Christian history slightly better than its theological implications, but that is not to say much.

That I had a psychosis involving the self-revelation of divine beauty is itself just another expression of the ongoing theophany of creation, which does indeed include terror and horror as well as love. It's how I've thought of things for a while. I do not know what it means in terms of psychopathology. It does at least leave my worries in a way that I don't obsess over them. That's not a bad thing, in terms of my mental health, provided I do not get another breakthrough episode.

I just wanna say in general that I am groping towards a view of creation as theophany and sacrament both. Orthodox Christians today talk about cosmos as sacrament. I know a few works of their ancient theology and scarcely their theology today, but it's there.

I have to assume that God cherishes without exception, even sin and evil he cherishes and nurtures, though he weeps to do so. I was talking about this with a divinity student. He pointed out that Christ wept. When my spiritual imagination at 18 became megalomaniacal and then shifted to shame and terror about the abuse of my spiritual powers, perhaps that was a reasonable response, given the facts as I understood them at the time. To the extent that the early stages of mania bring ""patterns of unusually clear, fast and creative associations"" (Jamison), I did indeed abuse them.

Mine now (after many bad fits!) is awesome. We don’t waste much time on why my issues are what they are but instead focus on what things I would like to change.

When discussing pharmacology test questions with other students I ALWAYS offer my personal input: « Oh well when I take my antipsychotics I take them with food because they work quicker.. »  or « i know I got that question right because when I was on lithium I did blood tests every 3 months if I was in therapeutic range »

Or, when discussing therapeutic communication: « well when I was a patient in the psych ward, I hated when nurses ignored me »

Or when discussing nursing roles: « well when I was in inpatient treatment for bulimia for a few months, my nurses did dbt exercises with me »

There’s no way to measure any chemical imbalance in the brain like you’d measure blood sugar or Hemoglobin A1C. 

Once the proper dose is determined, insulin does not have anywhere near the frightening side effects or withdrawals of psych meds when you have to try one after another. 

The truth is no one knows exactly how or why we get bipolar, how to treat it effectively and what to expect from treatment, from one person to another. 

Some people get lucky &amp; get the right meds &amp; coping skills without much affect on their lives. 
But that is not the majority. 

And diabetes will never carry the stigma that bipolar disorder does. 

ELI5: Bipolar is a disease of the brain that affects everyone differently. They are still doing research on the cause and treatment. There is no test to verify bipolar or determine severity, other than the opinion of pdoc after you fill out a couple of questionnaires and chat for a few minutes. Then you try a med combo called a “cocktail” that generally includes a mood stabilizer, anti-depressant &amp; maybe anti-anxiety meds. 

Then hang on—it’s gonna be a bumpy ride. You’ll change the meds around until something helps or your symptoms suddenly change, most likely worsen. 

And then you get up and do it again &amp; again...hopefully.

Though it was only last year when a manic phase coincided with a jobloss, abrupt quit from alcohol, and being physically assaulted by my ex fiancé that my symptoms put me over the top and i was fortunate to have good friends who were able to get me medical attention. 

Manic psychosis is the scariest feeling I’ve ever had. Like a god complex mixed with a false intuitive notion that the world is ending and you have some important role to play. 

I’m glad I had that experience, because without it I might not have ever been properly diagnosed. 

While I’ve had my down time in the last year, I can’t say I’ve been severely depressed or suicidal at all. And that’s different for me, so I’m happy.

I.e., it quickly triggers an episode.

This happened to me twice before I was diagnosed (I was diagnosed during a non-antidepressant induced episode though), and twice since when doctors have tried to introduce antidepressants (I'm on two mood stabilizers so in theory it'd be ok, alas).

The thing that sucked about it more than anything is that I didn't have the vocabulary to explain to the doctors what was happening so it just looked like the antidepressants didn't work and I was just depressed. It was a shitty time.

Its sadly a very imperfect science because our bodies all react differently to the different medications. Or lack of medications. As a previous response said, it's a spectrum (within a spectrum). There are degrees, different ends, different experiences of the same symptoms. No two bipolars look the same.

If you are experiencing manic episodes, a mood stabilizer will drastically reduce those moments of panic or hyper or however you want to describe it.

PunkRockMaestro,,,[],,,,text,t2_zqzi0,False,"Yes! You need to read Bipolar, Not So Much, about the spectrum of unipolar to bipolar disorder a guide to help people like yourself find themselves on it, and make sense of the illness, and how you might treat it besides medication. You can just think of yourself having a mood disorder, a disorder of regulation and rhythms, and sometimes your evolved processes get turned on too far or all at once and the system of balancing it breaks down. Treatment involves teaching you how to both regulate your life and also reign it back into rhythm. So what I'm getting at is that the solution is generally the same for everyone on the spectrum, it's just what exact kinds of experiences and treatments you'll be using to try and get yourself functioning the way most others do (with moods being helpful, congruent, and appropriate for situations)

It can help to not get too caught up in pathologizing everything, im bipolar this, i bipolard that, no just live your life and you'll learn to notice more and more when your feelings and experiences veer from normal and you can consciously get in front of it.

Some people may find it helps, but also be not noticing the ways in which it is hurting them. Especially the effects long-term, which you have no way of knowing, and seem risky.I believe it makes you think better and cures depression, I've done it all, but it's just a feeling for a little while inspiring capabilities you already have. Bipolar is a lifelong disease. You either manage it or you don't, you either use meds or you don't, but you have the disease, you are susceptible to episodes. Meds are there to prevent episodes as much as treat them, and for every episode you get there is a cost associated to your brain which long-term means you might not respond well to meds anymore. No one said that it was impossible to go off meds and cope and live like a normal person, it's possible for especially bp2. But for how long? And are they being totally honest with themselves? I made all the same claims that I'd fixed myself, I made it a few years without a serious episode once! Convinced myself they had me all wrong... No the drugs are worth their side effects for the protective aspect alone, it's not good to be obsessed with things that are ""pure"" and ""natural"" when you have a disease that is neither of those things you can't fix it with celery juice or spiritual mediumship, however lovely those things may be.",1566525019,{},exrvare,False,t3_cu5g37,True,t1_exrpm9t,/r/bipolar/comments/cu5g37/how_important_are_meds/exrvare/,1566525805,1,True,False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,,[],,,,,False,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PunkRockMaestro,,,[],,,,text,t2_zqzi0,False,"Motivated reasoning is the evolved human tendency to find reasons to do what you want to do anyway. It could just as easily be that your psychiatrist has plenty of money, is giving you his best professional advice, and that the frequency of your appointments is par for the course. I see mine once a month and I've been on the same drug with no news for a long time and he gets a salary. What I'm getting at is that there is only one way to treat medical issues and that's with medical science. Making a life and death decision like this based on the tone of voice in your psychiatrists voice when then get a flat and cancel is a long way off from that. Your doctor can't force you to take medications, you need to be supervised when tapering off of medications. Every single bipolar patient decides they are fine and can live without meds, you were fine half the time before remember? It was all those people who tripped you up, this time you'll stay in control!  Some people do live without their meds with milder forms of bipolar. But usually people who are 10/10 in a stable place with the ability to control their lives and do what they need to stay stable, not people who are just barely new to stability. You have to spend years building up the resilience in yourself to be able to cope like you were not able to in the past when your mood gets disordered again. If you've been tracking your moods and you have a solid lifestyle and backup plans you should do a scientific experiment and taper off and track your mood every day and share it with your psych. Make a pro/con list of meds. How bad are the side effects, REALLY? Are they really the side effects or are they amplified about your hatred of being different and needing a drug and you want to be ""pure""...

annalee_scott,,,[],,,,text,t2_96wnsv2,False,I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and moderate depression seven years ago and have been on and off of lamictal and Wellbutrin for years. I was tired of having to take meds all the time and go to doctors and pay money for them and so on.. so I weened off. It’s been 3 months without them. Mind u I weened off by myself. Go on google and it will tell u how to ween off the meds urself. I know it sounds stupid but as long as ur not on lithium u can prob do it urself. It sucks at first and it’s hard but the biggest thing that helped me is meditating and eating better. I can’t find the energy to work out so that’s out of the question but another thing I can say that drastically changed my life and helped me get off of the meds is microdosing magic mushrooms. Look it up. It’s the real deal natural medicine. I know it’s illegal and hard to get but it’s illegal cause big pharma has us by the balls. It’s all about money. I can’t stress enough that I haven’t felt this good and clear minded and “somewhat” happy in a long time but I’m getting there. Don’t let ppl tell u u need to be on meds. Another thing u can do instead of meds is juicing fresh celery juice every morning on an empty stomach. Check out “medical medium” on Instagram. I’m telling u it’s life changing both these things. I’ll never go back on medication . And this is coming from someone who couldn’t get out of bed for days and hold a job for shit.

There’s evidence that the longer you go untreated, the worse it will become. I’ve known several people (myself included) who have been stable for a while without meds, then it came on harder.

For me it's tough to show up and be productive.

It feels a little overwhelming and I get off task because I want to go for a walk or listen to music and experience things that are normally numbed when I'm not feeling as well.

What it says is that people with bipolar are both less likely to marry and have higher rates of divorce. 

What is really high are relationships that end when both partners have a mental illness. 

When one person is down and out and you’re relying on that partner to be understanding and get through that phase, they may also be experiencing symptoms of their illness. 

My advice- don’t date anyone who has a mental illness if you have a mental illness. It’s only compounding the challenge.

I was planning to jump off a certain 1,100ft skyscraper. I called the police on myself cause I was acting hysterical. And they took me to the hospital.

I was there for 18 hours, instead of the 72. I was able to call a family member to come convince the doc to let me go, it worked. 

The psych ward was hell. Probably because I was being resistant for the most part. I had my wrists strapped to my bed for most of the time. It was boring, no phone, nothing to read, not even a TV showing nonstop commercials. No windows, no clock, no sense of time. Just a cold room with bright fluorescent lights. 

There was lots of screaming and yelling from some of the other patients. I couldn't see anything, but I could clearly hear them out in the hall. 

They gave me breakfast and lunch but I didn't eat it. Didn't feel like eating, I did eventually eat a cookie and drank a cranberry juice box. Only food and drink I had the whole 18 hours. First thing I did when released was hog a water fountain for 3 minutes. 

I was evaluated by a state psychiatrist that came in later on. It was to determine if I was fit for release. The psychiatrist did the evaluation and discussed it with the 2 doctors I was under the ""care"" of. 

The doctors said no, and because I don't have insurance, I would be transferred to a state-run psychiatric hospital. At the time, I thought I was gonna be transferred to a private hospital, another hell on earth I've been to before few days earlier. When I learned about the state hospital, shit just got more real...

Fortunately! Family convenience the doctors that I'd be under their care and was finally released. Went back home to my apartment like nothing happened. 

However, due to my medical history with being hospitalized. If I'm hospitalized again, they're not letting me go. Not even if fam comes vouching for my release again. No more second chances. I'll be sent to a full-level psychiatric hospital where I would have to stay for probably quite some time. 

That's what I was told by the psych ward doctors tho, not my personal psychiatrist. So it's probably a bluff, but you never know.

One thing that's useful for me is understanding that no one really ever knows themselves. Identity shifts and mutates over time for everyone. Identity and sense of self is necessarily unstable. 

But meds, they bring stability in a different sense. I do, in an abstract way, feel more like myself when I'm on them, because I feel more stable. I don't get trapped in the drain that is my brain. I don't ruminate as much, or feel as bad, when I'm medicated. 

This illness is really confusing and lonely. This space helps me a lot. I actually personally found a lot of relief in coming to terms with my diagnosis. It actually brought a lot of things together and helped me see my past self through a very useful lense. It let me feel more compassion towards myself for some of the super dumb shit I've done in my life, for example. And it helped me recognize triggers and also tools for coping with those triggers, like going to bed and waking up on a schedule and exercising daily.

My story with stimulants is a bit complicated. My mom was a pharmacist and worked in the hospital for most of here career -- by the time I was born she worked in the hospital and did so up until she retired. And for a while she worked in physical rehab. Obviously if you've had a serious injury and need to learn to walk again, it takes a heavy toll on you and you can be seriously depressed. And even in the medical/neural model of depression, it's kind of agreed that antidepressants aren't necessarily a cure but they give you the ability to work through what's going on. Or that's how a lot of people feel. Long story short, the doctor who worked in rehab often prescribed antidepressants to the patients who were really struggling with depression after their accidents, and one would assume this was situational and not neurological defect, though everything you go through is mapped onto the brain so it could very well be the trauma gave their brain the shape of major depressive disorder. 

Anyways, of course antidepressants take a while to kick in. So it was common for him to prescribe ritalin in the interim because it *does* (or can) work as an antidepressant, and does so very quickly. The downside is that you can build up a tolerance and it stops working, so it's not the best drug for depression because it's not as reliable as an antidepressant. But before the first MAOI's were discovered, if your depression needed to be treated pharmaceutically, they used stimulants and opioids for short term relief. MDD is often cyclical too, a lot of people don't know that. 

But yeah, when Ritalin didn't work I ended up on Adderall. They're actually a fairly common off label use for bipolar depression. There's a misconception they will cause mania. It's a risk, but not a major one. I can totally understand why someone would think this. It seems somehow logical that a stimulant would cause mania. Research actually shows it can reduce mania believe it or not. But they aren't without risks. What they *can* do in bipolar patients is trigger bad anxiety.

Modafinil a much safer off label option if you wanted to treat bipolar depression dopaminergically.

I used to use weed to help manage my symptoms but this fall I smoked way, way too much one day and was sent into the most intense manic episode I've ever had. Like full blown conspiracies about my husbands friends and family and just completely lost touch with reality.

&amp;#x200B;

If i look back, weed never helped me with my symptoms really. It just made me not care so much about them. Made it easier to exist. But now that I'm actually getting proper treatment for my mood disorder, I don't need it and especially after the last mental break, I don't want it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was an all day, every day kind of user but something made me snap (still kinda think I maybe just tapped into the reality of words and contexts that I was missing before but if i tell ppl that they just say I need to get back on the suzie qs) 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, it's not gonna help you long term and the longer you use it to cover up whatever is going on, the longer it's gonna take to find something that will actually manage your symptoms. What I do suggest though, is using some CBD oil for sleep/anxiety. I think it's the part of weed that I loved most and so I'm still using that. It's non psychoactive and can be derived from hemp so it's legal in all 50 states if you are US based.

Sorry bro. Does it come with pain?

&gt; It's hard for me because I see in black-and-white and get caught up in words.

And then if you try to infer or assume what they mean then they get upset at you for that as well. It is maddening. Realistically speaking there must be some massive difference in our social skills because we are on the spectrum. It is nasty.

Thank you.

Oh yeah my therapist is probably the reason I am still alive.

That sounds really stressful. I hope it doesn't cause you pain.

And yes a lot of that sounds like him, and of course I knew some of the difficulties going on, and I accept them, all the ups and downs. I truly love him beyond anything I’ve ever known and he is just, my person. 

As far as my emotional needs, I’ve come to accept the hot and cold, and have found more reasonable ways to voice when I need a little word of reassurance, and have even been able to self soothe with that, which is a big step for me. As far as consistency for him, I’ve been pretty rock steady since day one. Aside from going obsessive a handful of times and losing my shit if he shuts me out all the way, I’ve never said a single negative word to him, I’ve never walked away, never abandoned him, and continuously loved and supported him, which he knows and recognizes. 

I guess the issue right now is... the last major PROPER conversations we’ve had (proper in that it’s been more than a word or two at once and he was hopping mad at the time) was him wanting to break up and yelling and yada yada and done, and yet now, months later, he’s still making sure to maintain some semblance of interaction, still saying good morning and good night, dropping a ‘baby’ once every week or two... I even got a five-minute back and forth text exchange last night which was a huge deal (even though each response was one word) - do you think all of this means he’s still in this with me?

Cult_recruiter,,,[],,,,text,t2_wvx33,False,"My husband has severe anxiety disorder and he also finds it hard when I withdraw.

The thing about my personal experience with bipolar, is that when I'm hypomanic I'm preoccupied with other things that aren't my SO. We can be quite obsessive about things that you may not be able to understand or be a part of.

When I'm depressed I'm not sad, so much as my brain has kind of shut down. I can't really have conversations and stuff because my brain just isn't functioning at that level. I'm not interested in what people have to say, and I also don't have anything that I really want to tell anybody.

It's not emotional in the same way that bpd may be. I don't get withdrawn and quiet because of an emotional reason, im not hating on people, it's just that I don't have the energy to be present. I feel as if I'm sort of disappearing. 

Bipolar people can be very hot and cold in relationships, and we can be plain old weird people. We aren't always easy to live with, and many of us lead quite solitary lives. 

You need to decide whether being with a bipolar person is going to be too much of a trigger for your bpd. Bipolar people need stability and routine, and you need someone who is going treat you in a consistent way - bipolar people are the opposite of consistent. 

But I do believe in true love and if you really love this guy I think you should both be open about what you need from the relationship, and also let him go away and be in his bipolar funk, and respect his boundaries when he is feeling like that. But make sure he is still making you feel secure. I often need to say to my husband ""sorry it's not you, I'm just feeling depressed right now, you haven't done anything wrong.""

I'm 30.  I had a child at 24 and was diagnosed with bipolar (among others) at 28, so, granted, my answers came *after* parenthood, but if anything I believe it's improved my parenting.  I had a *very* rocky childhood and spent many years trying to cope on my own, and it was... uh, messy.  Frankly my life is a dumpster fire right now, but my relationship with kiddo is stronger than it's ever been.

Sometimes simply having the label of ""bipolar"" in and of itself is a lifeline.  It helps me to understand why I do what I do, why I feel what I feel, why I react the way I react.  It gives me access to the tools and coping mechanisms I need to monitor myself, to mitigate any resulting damage, and to even recognize my highs and lows before they happen and gives me a chance to prepare.  I better understand my personal limits now, and feel less guilty when I need to take a step back from a situation;  I've gone from berating myself for being ""weak"" to cutting myself a break when stress levels peak, which is refreshing.  

Of course I'm not a perfect parent, but there really is no such thing.  My child has anger issues, yes, from the first few years of my bad attempts at coping alone and unprepared which she observed and absorbed, but *now* we're in therapy, we practice calming techniques together, and we learn from each other.  But for us, it's just me, my wife, and our child;  we have no external support system, so that does make things harder though not impossible.  Everyone has different hurdles.  My wife is incredibly understanding and considerate, and now we're both knowledgeable on our mental health and can cope together, support each other on our off days, and encourage each other to continue moving forward.  Without my wife, no, I could not be a good parent to our child, but she's also the type of person that if I were bedridden-sick multiple times a month -- as in, if I had a *physical* illness with visibly bad days -- she would take over for me with the kiddos and household, as she knows I would do the same for her.  *That's* what makes the difference.

My advice is to surround yourself with supportive loved ones and arm yourself with knowledge.  :)  Parenthood is essentially teamwork, whatever your team might look like or whatever your personal hurdles are, and you're already leagues ahead of where I was when I started down this path.  &lt;3  You can do it!",1553813578,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ejm5uri,,t3_b6pcgl,True,t3_b6pcgl,/r/bipolar/comments/b6pcgl/can_i_live_normally/ejm5uri/,1553813579,1,True,False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two weeks ago I self harmed for the first time in five years. I was so scared I wouldn't survive my suicidal thoughts this time so I did the next best thing I guess. I've got scars that will be around for awhile, but I got help as soon as I could. All of this could have been avoided, my near death, my self mutilation, my self destructive tendencies, a of it. If I had only stopped being strong long enough to ask for help.

I agree with what RedVelvet said - lots of different flavors out there with many different mindsets.  I've been fortunate in that chapters I have been to are open and sympathetic with those also dealing with mental health issues.

First, I will repeat what one AA old timer said to me... (aside from not drinking) ""If anyone, no matter how long they've been sober, tells you exactly what you need to do, ignore them.""  Fellow AA members can make suggestions, or say what worked for them, but they don't know what your friend is dealing with or what his exact situation is.  Everyone is different in AA other than wanting to stop drinking and stay sober.

Second, when I stopped drinking my bipolar monster flared up, which led me to start drinking again.  I had two choices, either battle the alcoholism or battle the bipolar - both are fucking hard.   And unfortunately, I have to battle both at the same, because if I didn't get the bipolar under control, there'd be no way I'd be able to quit drinking.  Right now, I'm on meds and seeing a therapist who can provide counselling for my dual-diagnosis of alcoholism and bipolar disorder.  A competent professional knows how to deal with both issues.  Some guys in an AA meeting don't.

RoaringLioness-,,,[],,,,text,t2_3cbm8ztx,False,"My life has changed immensely in the past year since I had that first major episode of Mania. At first I thought it was the single worst thing to happen to me but in time I have got a lot better at dealing with my mood swings, (just got off the 800 mg of carbamazepine I was taking daily for a little over a year) but they still happen. Especially lately, but  each time I get better at calming myself and being aware of my mental state.  But now, I’m thankful for it because I’ve got so much passion and zest for life as a result. That may sound horrible because after all this is a debilitating mental illness to have and it’s different for each person so it may not be the same for you (yet still very similar) and that’s okay. It takes a lot of time to figure out your triggers I’m still trying to understand what causes me to go into an episode and swing from mood to mood at the speed of light which is super exhausting as I’m sure you know. What I recommend is just taking it one day at a time and think of the things you are doing or experiencing that lead you up to having a mood swing from one side to the other and see if there’s a correlation. For me when I get a lack of sleep I have a tendency to have a greater amount of anxiety on top of hypomania which luckily hasn’t led to psychosis again. But it takes time and patience. So I say just go with the flow the best you can and each day try and really look inward at how you’re feeling and what may have caused it beforehand. I hope in some way way this could be helpful for ya because I know it feels good to have somebody relate to me as well and wish I would’ve had somebody to help me out in the beginning.

Most days are good days and I feel productive most of the time. I have a good job and some good friendships. My bank account is finally out of the red (thank you spending habits) and I’m starting to date again after a breakup.

It takes a great deal of energy to use mindfulness. So when we run out of energy we loose control of how our mind functions. The meds can help to slow the mind so it takes less energy to use mindfulness. When i am really low i just try to sleep it off and recharge. I find a cup of coffee helpful sometimes but i often run into impulse control problems on stimulants. Where my peripheral awareness is very open to sensations (internal or external) and my mind is seeking/looking to focus on something that will make it feel good/release dopamine.

Having a plan to kill yourself makes it easier to do it when the impulse arises. Instead get rid of the plan and don't believe you thoughts when they pop up telling you to kill yourself. Its just and old pattern/path that is easy to follow like a short cut through the forest. It takes more energy to cut a new path because you are rewiring your brain. Its easy for me to tell you how to do this but its much more difficult for us to use when we need to. Its almost like we forget our new coping strategy and resort back to the old one because its easier to remember. Don't let you thoughts control you. We have hundreds of thousands of thoughts every day imagine if you had to do or believed every thought you had, you'd be mindless.

Try meditating for 15 minutes while maintaining focused awareness on the breath without controlling it and then modulating the level of peripheral awareness you have (thoughts/5 senses). You'd be amazed at how quick you focus is switching between your focused attention and the things you find in your peripheral awareness. Its very overwhelming in the beginning the same way retraining you brain is overwhelming in the beginning in regards to pop up thoughts/intrusive thoughts/suicidal ideation/paranoia/self doubt/memories... or what ever problem is hard wired into your brain to some extent.

What i liked about zyprexa is it would force me to get a consistent sleep and it would slow down my mind thought the day.

On the flip side I’m actually quite lucky as I’m pretty stable right now with work and relationships and I pushed to see a Psychiatrist because I don’t want to ruin my life again. 

I had to be more than assertive with a new Doctor to do it. They always said “You have a diagnosis, we just have to get the treatment right and you’ll be okay”. I explained over and over “I don’t think I have depression, something is wrong, antidepressants and psychology appointments aren’t helping, I’m all over the place”. I literally had to say to this Doctor “I respect you as a general practitioner but you aren’t a specialist in mental heath issues, if I had a stomach problem I’d request to see a gastroenterologist, please respect my wishes to be involved in my treatment plan, I request a referral to a specialist and if they have the same opinion as you that’s great as they may have a different treatment option we haven’t tried and if they have a different opinion we can work on that when it comes along” 

The Psychiatrist wants me to take the Lamotrigine. I start in 6 weeks. They want the EEG done first. They also don’t want to prescribe on the spot so they told me to make sure I research and am happy or prepared for the risks and possible side affects

Backstory: I came from a home of mental/physical abuse. And I watched my parents abuse each other (my mother is bipolar schizophrenic and my dad, well he’s very controlling)

Millie was my getaway. She and I had one hell of a bond. When I’d be hurt/crying from whatever happened that day she’d lay on my chest and purr consistently until I fell asleep, and when I woke she was still there.

My mom suffered an episode and gave her away while I was at school. I  came home to find my friend was gone. My sister revealed later that Millie was killed shortly after by a coyote (my mom had her declawed and then gave her to a farm as a barn cat).

The one behind me is named Sid... Sid Vicious. I found him and when I picked him up as a kitten he IMMEDIATELY started purring. No shit IMMEDIATELY, and gave me face boops. He also looks IDENTICAL to Millie. He sleeps on my chest and purrs, and when I’m hurt the most he knows exactly what to do.

The one that lays to the right is named Piper. Piper is my boyfriends cat that reminded me of Millie and was the reason I found Sid.

Sucks to hear your predicament, been there too. I’ve been taking Seroquel since April 2016 - (EDIT: previously wrote 2014, this was incorrect) - and I also stacked on a ton of weight with Seroquel. Got as high as 104kg from 88kg.  After a real downer of a day at 98kg, I came across an article on the Harvard university website documenting the rate of re-hospitalisation due to manic episodes in a bipolar population (https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/probiotics-for-bipolar-disorder-mania-2018062514125) after supplementing them with probiotics (or a placebo). Long story short, it reduced episodes of re-hospitalisation by half, and for those with the worst cases of gut inflammation, it reduced re-hospitalisation by 90%. No side effects (except for the mighty gas my lord), I figured what do I have to lose?

I have been taking a probiotic (Inner Health Candex SB -&gt; https://images.app.goo.gl/SDmKx4CqMw4QsdoB8) since July last year. I’m back down to 88kg, the lightest I have been in 6 years (even pre-Seroquel!). Seroquel dosage is largely the same. I’ve been able to resist cravings and general vices far more easily. Caffeine, alcohol etc. Placebo? Possibly. Lost weight, feeling full much easier, greater cognitive restraint and lack of cravings (which kick in about 1-2 weeks in), no placebo there.

Give it a go :) you only have $40-50 to lose. If you do, keep me posted as I hope they work for you the way it has for me ❤️ wish you the best 🙏🏼 and beware of the initial gas 😂😂😂",1581033247,{},fgqwz3d,False,t3_ezv4vc,True,t3_ezv4vc,/r/bipolar/comments/ezv4vc/fkg_seroquel/fgqwz3d/,1581037548,1,True,False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,,[],,False,[],,False,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The only thing that helped me was staying positive and most importantly taking it one day at a time. There’s light at the end of the tunnel you just have to be willing to open your eyes. 

Look yourself in the mirror every day and tell yourself you’re strong and beautiful. 

The brain needs training just as much as you’d train a muscle in your body. So train your brain to be kind towards you.

Talk to yourself every day like you’d talk to your best friend. Cause by the end of the day, you’re your own best friend.

A way to counter this is to reduce the amount of salt (Lithium is a salt and causes the water retention, but it's a bit harder to reduce) you are eating too much.
