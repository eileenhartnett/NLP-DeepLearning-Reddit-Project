First off, I have been diagnosed bipolar 1 for seven years. In 2014 I was in the place you currently are. Unstable, life falling apart, friends leaving me high and dry, not understanding my illness at all, no meds worked. Sophomore year of college triggered mine, but a bad job led to my diagnosis.
Yes, it can get better. I have been mostly stable for two years now. I had to try over 27 meds and multiple combos of them to find something that worked. Up until I achieved stability I had no idea who I was. I felt like my identity was bipolar disorder, but once it's no longer calling the shots, you come out this badass person who has grown and learned and changed sooo much. I love who I am on the other side of this battle.
You should not be thinking of suicide every day. Once you are stable it might cross your mind if you are having a really bad day, but for the most part, that will be a distant memory. Do I still have a detailed vision of how I'd do it? Yes. That shit sticks with you.
With decision making, if you are manic and you want to start a new career, buy a new car, adopt a pet, jump into a new relationship, anything big with financial, sexual, or judicial consequences, I recommend waiting 3 months before moving forward. I have made soooo many mistakes while manic. After about the 4th big one, my husband and I agreed that I could think of something I was interested in doing, but then wait to act on it for three to four months and see if I still want it. Grand majority of time I don't and that's how I know it's mania.
You can't rely on other people to not leave. In my experience, people will come and go. They may promise they can handle it, but bipolar disorder is intense and a lot of people get overwhelmed and walk away. THAT'S OKAY. You are not a lost cause if this happens. And typically the ones who are worth it will fight for you, learn about your disorder, and support you regardless. I've had people walk away when i was acting crazy and then come back once I got stable. Unstable bipolar people can be very toxic and sometimes people need to cut ties for a bit until you can get stable. But don't let it make you feel crazy or worthless if people walk away.
Truthfully the only way to get control is find your right meds combo. Bipolar disorder doesn't go away. It is a defect in your brain and you need a medication to balance your brain chemicals so you can achieve stability. Unfortunately, no one medication works for everyone. So you're going to have to try them.
Stability doesn't mean you are zonked and emotionless. You should feel decently normal, not overly happy, not tired and uninterested in life. Strive for content and optimistic.
Best of luck to you!",,1587699797,{},foeb8nn,False,t3_g6ss9t,False,True,t3_g6ss9t,/r/bipolar/comments/g6ss9t/crushed/foeb8nn/,1587713408,1,True,False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,0,[],,,,,

As I've learned to parse it out (through mindfulness), the ""tics"" thing feels like a spillover of physical/mental energy more than an anxiety thing. I never considered bipolar, but I mentioned periods of other urges that correlate with when these fits happen and she started asking about traditional manic symptoms (which I do not have). Honestly, I find the whole thing confusing...

Anyway, the tics! They are usually preceded by pacing or compulsively scratching a roving itch that wanders around my head and body. The twitching/tics have changed over time. The can be hitting my head or legs, one side of my face twitching, my whole body locking up in muscle contractions, my head jerking to the side, my chest contracting(?), or my neck tensing up in weird ways. The motions you described sound like stuff I did as a kid too (30 now)...

I'm always conscious and aware of my surroundings, but usually can't talk in the middle of them. Like you, it feels compelled, but when push comes to shove, I can suppress them (often just temporarily). Depending on the severity it can get hard to breathe. Individual fits last 30-60 seconds and a whole episode can last 5-30 minutes. I often get very tired and confused once the episode is over. 

The head/neck/chest tics can be standalone and sound more like what you're describing (1-2 seconds).

Of course I‚Äôll get a ping of jealousy and hurt when I see my person with someone else, but that‚Äôs something I‚Äôll just need to reconcile with and be at peace with whatever emotion comes out. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that you won‚Äôt be committed to each other. It just means that you have physical needs that need to be met with other folks. It‚Äôs just a matter of communicating and reassuring the other that this doesn‚Äôt devalue the relationship. So long as it‚Äôs all safe and consensual, I see nothing wrong with it. 

I also identify as queer. One of the signs that help me be aware of my mania is when I start craving penetration from a penis. I typically only date non-cismen, often times subs/bottoms. That‚Äôs usually not a problem, I get satisfied knowing that I‚Äôve satisfied my person. To me, it‚Äôs not even that I want to be satisfied from penetration‚ÄîI mean that could be done with a strap-on! What I really crave is physically feeling inside me that I‚Äôve satisfied a penis.

I haven‚Äôt dated nor slept with anyone since I‚Äôve started treatment.

I couldn‚Äôt just leave the water because this scary demonic teenage boy was on the shore swinging a knife at me, blocking me from getting out. Eventually my strength gave out too and I couldn‚Äôt swim or run anymore, and as the guy creepily chanted on shore I realized my body was now transforming into a swamp creature. Luckily that scared me enough to wake up. üòÖ 

I agree with the person above me a lot. Prolonged use of Xanax and Ambien causes very harsh ‚Äúrebound anxiety‚Äù and rebound insomnia. I thought that was common knowledge. Xanax was originally designed to treat acute, severe panic attacks. It‚Äôs not meant to be a daily ‚Äúwinding down‚Äù medicine but unfortunately doctors have become too liberal with it over the years. It is so powerful that it changes the brain‚Äôs GABA receptors. GABA is the neurotransmitter that calms overactive brain activity. Ambien definitely causes vivid dreams too. It may be time to taper off at least one of those meds and replace with something that‚Äôs actually safe to take long term.",,1593576858,{},fwjur6j,False,t3_hiwvk1,False,True,t3_hiwvk1,/r/bipolar/comments/hiwvk1/manic_and_having_royally_fucked_up_dreams/fwjur6j/,1593579175,1,True,False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,0,[],,,,,

I found that if you tell a medical health professional/therapist who is a really perceptive and insightful person they can usually pick up on things pretty quick. My therapists/psychiatrists help me to be more self aware when I‚Äôm in this mindset. 

About two years ago I spent six months being paranoid thinking Russian spies were spying on me. Id see all these different signs that made so much sense. In hindsight it really did make sense but when I think back I remember my emotions being so super heightened... like I was worried that this one white truck was owned by one of my Russian neighbors (the spy) and I remember him driving by my block every time I went and walked my dog, like no matter what time of day... everytime... and then I kept thinking he had the only one with the white truck why was he following me around... a while later after I forgot all about it I realized there were like three or four other white trucks around me but in my mind I was so convinced his was the only one I didn‚Äôt even see the other ones lol.

A funny thing...I told my psychiatrist who is Russian and has a very very thick accent...about the Russian spies and she was like why do you think they are spying on you?

[],,goldenpacificsunset,,,[],,,,text,t2_6kkdkyei,False,False,[],"Hello my friend: I too am a pet lover. I was diagnosed as being bipolar about a decade ago. I know what it‚Äôs like having your own place and then having to go back home and being poor and living under someone else‚Äôs roof. I know what it‚Äôs like to love a dog so much and also to lose a dog. It‚Äôs so incredibly painful. (I have two dogs that died of old age). So I hope my input will be helpful, I really want you to stay well...

Can you get other family to take care of him for a while? Your dog is important to you, you depend on each other, it‚Äôll be worse if you let him go. Talk to your friends, your boss....put flyers up...reach out to people and tell them your situation...even post it on Facebook if you have to. There will be someone out there who will have a kind heart who will help you out even if it‚Äôs just a few weeks at a time. Maybe it‚Äôs an elderly neighbor or a store owner in your town who maybe just lost someone. Maybe someone who‚Äôs alone and just wants a pet around. Maybe it‚Äôs a casual friend or coworker who‚Äôs really not close to you but maybe talking about your situation might help to form bonds with other people you might not feel close with. Many times difficulties can be a conduit for us to reconnect and build relationships with others. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being vulnerable and letting people know you need help. What‚Äôs the worst thing people can say...no? But the worst thing that can happen is if you lose a family member you love, your dog, just because you have a selfish member/s of your household. 

Question: Why is your mom siding with her non-husband/non boyfriend anyway. Why isn‚Äôt she supporting you ? Why are you and the dog the inconvenience? You‚Äôre trying to get on your feet. You have mental struggles, why does the everybody else‚Äôs issues trump yours? I hear from your story that their relationship issue is taking a toll on you. The pending removal of your dog is taking a toll on you. Not making enough money is making things harder to bear. You need that dog, he is your emotional support and vice versa. If you‚Äôre posting on this community board, I‚Äôm guessing you have bipolar tendencies in your life. You need to be in a safe environment with no undue stress. Being bipolar myself... you know having a dog is invaluable...and priceless. Let‚Äôs do a rundown of numbers.... in an ideal situation these are things someone bipolar would do to make themselves feel better....

A therapist costs money (what like 60-65.00 per session), a psychiatrist let‚Äôs say 100.00 per month, a spa treatment to relax or massage... that‚Äôs like 75.00 per session... someone to listen... that‚Äôs priceless... someone to love you back... priceless... someone for you to love and look forward to being with... also priceless. 

Worry and anxiety that will happen if you lose him... guilt... anger.... will your mother and her friend be able to replace the priceless love of this animal? Will they pay for your therapy? Will they emotionally support you when you lose him? And what will they be able to do to help you heal from this separation. I‚Äôm thinking.... nothing? 

I know you‚Äôre probably guilty about being a drain to their resources but you‚Äôre the child, no matter how old you are they have the duty to support you and care for you. You did not choose to be born,they chose for you. It‚Äôs tough times, don‚Äôt feel bad about moving home. Many many people are going through the same thing and many families are welcoming their kids with open arms. It‚Äôs the parents‚Äô responsibility to make sure you‚Äôre all right and not treat you and the things you love like they‚Äôre a burden. 

I‚Äôm guessing they probably ask you to do a lot of things for them too. Free labor which would cost them lots of $$ elsewhere. 

Self-care is important my friend and this dog sounds like something you need for self care.

You‚Äôre probably a very gentle person. I can tell, I‚Äôm The same way. But draw the line and tell them you need the dog, don‚Äôt sacrifice your well being because they don‚Äôt like that he‚Äôs a burden. Compromise is important. Have an agreement you all can live with. Why would you have to be the one to lose? Pay them back when you get back on your feet again but don‚Äôt give up your dog. You deserve to have him in your life. 

My friend, my heart goes out to you....no matter the situation, there is always a way around it. Please don‚Äôt lose hope, in time it will get better. There are people out there who care, sometimes you just haven‚Äôt found them yet but they are there. I will keep you in my prayers. I have faith all will be better. Sending you many hugs.

You gotta take into account meds that are similar in efficacy or in dose. Also incompatibilities with other meds. Weighing pros and cons of side effects vs helping or making worse. Being on one med can make you unable to try 6 others. Pre-existing health conditions rule out a bunch. Age as well. Example: Abilify, Abilify Maintena, and Aristada are the ""same"" thing in certain compounds but fillers and half-life differ. Generics that utilize the slow-release mechanisms often function differently than the original brand which causes complications as well (throwback to the pharmacy fucking up). Comorbidities, etc.

Trying ""everything"" for one person isn't the same for another and can really only be determined by the practitioner.

It worked!!!! No migraine today.  I felt good and mostly on point on my 1.5 hour and two-video call interviews.  I feel like I was warm, funny, and genuine in my interview, and not getting an m migraine mid-interview was fantastic.

I think I found my pattern so I am going to stick with it.  No more sugar.  Limited carbs.  Focus on protein and stay away from all the trigger foods.  I'll see how long I can keep this rolling

1) Stop. Breathe. Seriously... stop and breathe. You need to. I feel it. Just do it.

2) You CAN do this. You just have to find the way.

3) Communicate. Talk to your instructors.  They will work with you if you are WILLING to do the work.  I‚Äôm a college professor. Trust me. They will help you (and they pretty much have to if you divulge your diagnosis) as much as they can as long as you are being honest and not taken advantage of their flexibility. 

4) Slow it all down.  Everything that is assaulting your brain right now, slow it all down.  Picture something calming, like a clean desk, ready to have work done on it.

5) Assess what you need to do and set REALISTIC expectations: not the easiest thing to do during an episode. If you have a trusting friend, allow them to help you decipher what is ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù and LISTEN to them, don‚Äôt argue or rationalize. At this moment, there‚Äôs a good chance you CAN‚ÄôT do that.

6) Break everything down and group them into REALISTIC blocks of goals.  You can‚Äôt do everything in one day, no matter how ‚ÄúSuperman‚Äù you feel.  The clock is your kryptonite: you can‚Äôt win.

7) Small victories.  Tackle one goal (or assignment) at a time and ONLY one assignment at a time.  No other assignments exist except the one you are working on.

8) Reassess after a few small victories. Report to your instructor what you‚Äôve done. Then look at your timeline to catch up and, along with your instructor and your support, reassess if getting where you need to be is going to be feasible.  If not, you may need to make the difficult choice of cutting back on courses if your school will make the exception or works on that way.  A long journey may seem daunting without a vehicle, but a bicycle can still get you to your destination.  Progress should be your aim.

9) Don‚Äôt compare yourself to your friends or former classmates.  No good comes from it.  There‚Äôs so many stories of people finding success later in life. Take your time. Your journey is yours: no one else‚Äôs.

I was convinced there was no way I could continue living my life the same way I have been since I was an adult. I just Needed to leave my husband. I couldn‚Äôt stand the thoughts of him any more. I couldn‚Äôt take the feeling of worthlessness i have in my job and my life as a mother and wife. I feel like a total failure. I couldn‚Äôt see any alternative as I felt I had tried everything. I just wanted to quit, give up, give in to the darkness. Then I had a friend actually agree with my thoughts. He told me that I was feeling this way for the right reasons, that it wasn‚Äôt just me. Somehow, when he validated my feelings I realized that my life does, in fact, suck. I wasn‚Äôt just suffering because of my mental illness. I had always thought the shit was in my head. Then I told my husband how I felt. He agreed also. He encouraged me to leave. After a week of contemplating how I would do this, we had a vacation that had been planned ahead of time. It allowed me to escape that darkness and remember what I used to feel like, what my marriage and motherhood used to feel like. I talked reasonably with my husband and made him understand why he needed to change. Our problems are not just stemming from my BP. I felt the biggest weight lifted from me when I felt he saw me and understood me. 
All I‚Äôm saying is, things could seriously be shitty. But even though doctors and therapists tell you that shit, you deserve more. But the truth of the matter is that you will get past it and start feeling better. You will look back and say to yourself ‚ÄúI can get through this.‚Äù You just have to go one day at a time. I do think we all are delaying the inevitable. But our diagnosis and treatment forces us to be aware of it. That‚Äôs not always a bad thing. In reality, it gives us a unique perspective in looking at life. Maybe one day, like today, you‚Äôll help someone else by sharing how you feel. I hope that is the case.

You're welcome; I really hope it helps. I just feel so alone sometimes, even though I have people who love and care for me. I just want to scream at people about how terrifying and confusing it is being in my own head when it gets bad. How unpredictable it can be, just being a person, even on medication. I'm usually pretty functional on meds, even though they still feel like they're *taking* something from me, like a piece of my soul. Even then, though, I've crashed right through my meds and had episodes anyway, and I'm always just *waiting* for myself to fall off the edge again. No matter what I'm doing, even if I'm enjoying myself, there's always a little voice - or not so little voice - in my head reminding me that this is temporary and I'm going to swing one way or the other. It's scary. I don't feel like I have any control, like I'm just delaying things. I can't explain that to people properly, if they haven't experienced it. And then there's the episodes themselves. I can't explain what real paranoia feels like. What crushing depression feels like when I want to die, but I simply don't have the energy to kill myself right now. What it feels like to see things that aren't there. How it feels to come down from hypomania and have to reconcile my actions with who I think I am as a person. How... *all* the other shit feels. And all this, while *trying* to live a normal life. I'm just... I'm so tired. And now I'm in just such a weird place - mentally, in life, whatever - that I feel like I'm going up and down at the same time. I can't even explain that feeling to myself, let alone other people. I just have that feeling, like you get just before a storm, like you get when you're cresting a wave, like that something is coming. I've talked to my psych and my therapist about it in the last couple of days, and basically the advice is to keep taking my meds, my emergency meds if I need them, and just hunker down and go to the hospital is it gets too much.

Along with that bipolar people tend to be more intelligent, empathetic and creative than the general population they become less prejudiced and often become curious of my episodes of depression, hypomania and psychosis. 

As for the sigma, I personally have seen that if someone admits they have a problem and is getting help people won't be as stigmatised (though that sigma is still there), even if they do something bad a lot of people will see that they're trying to improve themselves and will be forgiving. 

As for those who don't commit to help after they notice they have a problem. I feel like they as individuals deserve the sigma as they tend to harm themselves and those around them. This is true especiallyof cluster B personality disorders being antisocial, borderline, histrionic and narcissistic since these people think everyone else is the problem rather than them. On the other hand people with bipolar and schizophrenia are more likely to notice and feel like they have a problem and get help (or go to a mental hospital). 

I personally have dealt with three people that most likely have have borderline personality disorder based on my psychiatrist's opinion and they all have been generally terrible people. Told them the same thing on my psychiatrists advice, everyone else isn't the problem you are, get the help you need or get fucked. And saying that to them has got some of them into the therapy they need. 

At the end of my rant.

I feel that if you admit you have a problem and try to improve that many people will be supportive of you and will often even be curious of your condition and suffering, if you aren't people will rarely give you sympathy.

No, it does matter how you reject someone based on something they can't change. If I have a physical preference the other person can't change, I won't tell them that's the reason why I rejected them. I would cite bad chemistry or bad timing. Why should I tell them ""I'm rejecting you cause you're too tall"" or ""I'm rejecting you cause you have diabetes"". What good will knowing that do for them? They can't change these things and it's not their fault. They don't need to feel rejected for something they can't help. Plus telling them why makes it seem like it's their fault.

You have to be honest with yourself and accept the diagnosis.  Bipolar disorder is a serious condition and can take your life. 

Knowing how severe the consequences can be you have go take steps to minimize the severity of the and number episodes.  First, tell your doctor everything and be honest.  Don't hide the thoughts of suicide or self-harm because you are scared or embarrassed.  The more the doctor knows, the better the treatment plan.  Don't be scared of going to the hospital.  If you are in a bad way and scared, go to the hospital.  It is better to go on your own than to be taken involuntarily.

The treatment plan is based on the knowledge and experience of the doctor.  There are no blood or urine tests to show what brain chemicals are askew.  Everything is based on your descriptions and what little observations the doctor can make during visits.  Again, honesty is paramount.  Stay away from street drugs, alcohol and weed.  The doctor has a hard enough job coming up with a treatment plan.  There is no need to make it harder.  Take your medications religiously.  Don't try the old I am hypomanic.  I will stop my meds to stay there.  That's bad!  That is a really, really bad idea.  Really bad.  Bad! Bad! Bad!  I hope that makes a point.

I have been dealing with this my whole life.  I know how terrible it is.  It has almost taken me.  It haunts me daily.  It is difficult.  Keep this in mind.  More people love you than you think.  You touch more lives than you know.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar II 11 years ago and ADD 9 years ago. I saw a psych when I was first diagnosed who put me on a mood stabilizer and nothing else. She missed the ADD diagnosis and everything was all wrong.

I looked for a new psych with the help of my mom (I was young at the time), and we found a good one. He diagnosed me with ADD in the first meeting, put me on an entirely new drug regimen, including a stimulant and a mood stabilizer. I've been on stimulants as well as a mood stabilizer for 9 years and have never once even considered stopping them nor has my psych suggested it. (I have increased or decreased the dose of stimulants depending on my symptoms, but only in response to ADD symptoms and never due to mania.)

In my scenario, I was not looking for any specific medications. I was looking for someone to treat my symptoms. I clearly had issues with focus, retention, memory, all the ADD things that were not being successfully treated with just a mood stabilizer. I found this helpful that I was really looking for a medical expert who could help me determine the best treatment for my symptoms. The goal wasn't necessarily more medicine or any specific medicine but was more manageable symptoms.

Also to note, I had very severe ADD symptoms. I was a biology major who started out strong in her first years, but once bipolar and ADD hit, I had a reading level below a 3rd grader. I was significantly impaired in just daily life, let alone college classes. I don't know if this influenced my psych to give me stimulants or if he just isn't opposed to people with bipolar being on stimulants.

With that being said, my experience with psychs is sometimes really about luck. Sometimes you get shitty psychs that have no clue or just don't care. Sometimes you get psychs that understand the symptoms and the meds and how they work for each patient.

I would look for a psych that knows the meds on the market and when best to use them. If you find one then you can talk with them about your current concerns and mention what has worked in the past and in what scenarios they worked.

This is just how it all worked out for me. Hopefully it helps and if not then I do hope you find some advice that does lead you in the right direction.

Fucked myself over financially a few years ago. Didn't realize it at the time, but I was definitely hypomanic. I started writing a ridiculously detailed thing here about what I did, but, to summarize--insane credit card debt that led me to bankruptcy, back taxes owed that I just sat on, car repossessed because I ignored the bills (got it back quickly at least)... But I've basically cleaned myself up on all of this BS I got myself into.

For awhile, the only thing I was paying on time was my rent, because the only thing that really scared me was becoming homeless. I've gone a year now with making payments for everything on time. I obsessively check my bank and credit accounts, at least daily, sometimes multiple times a day (which kind of seems unhealthy, but it keeps me in check). I am scared of becoming hypo again and screwing up, but I know I can't do another bankruptcy for 6 years, and the idea of jail time is frightening. I just hope I'm still scared if hypomania creeps up on me. 

I know people in similar positions aren't as lucky. There are numerous stories where people end their lives over debt. Some end up in jail. I think I feel survivor's guilt knowing that. I feel privileged. I feel bad. I throw like $5 at GoFundMes when I can (when I was hypo, I had reoccurring monthly donations to some charities I love, but I realistically just can't), for people who need things like rent or medical assistance. It's a drop in the bucket, but it's the only thing that sort of makes me feel like I'm making amends with the universe.

No advice on making extra cash, but DEFINITELY stay away from get-rich-quick schemes. There are so many out there, especially right now, and they'll get you in even more trouble.

Quitting smoking took a combination of things. First tried e-cigs (before vape was a thing), gum, losanges, and when none of those worked I started doubling up using them all at once. When vape shops started to pop up I started vaping a lot. Started strong but gaping alone kept the cravings away. I then tried to transition to losanges again. It took some time but basically I started vaping less and less, using lower strength until I was just using losanges. 

Once I got on just losanges I was addicted to those for a while. Probably a couple of years, and even tho it wasn‚Äôt tobacco I still hated being addicted to something and they got EXPENSIVE. At one point my girlfriend suggested I just eat tic-tacs. I laughed at her, but I tried it. Obviously I still had physical cravings but the tic-tacs really curbed the mental side because I had something in my mouth. 

It still sucked but at that point, since losanges were so weak, I just roughed it out. I was eating tic tacs for a while, then gum, always chewing on something and then finally phased that out. 

It‚Äôs been 3 years, this month actually, nicotine free and I 100% believed I would never quit. It‚Äôs tough, but worth it. See what works for you and give it time.

The second thing you can do is dark therapy, so basically you probably won't sleep but you can go into the 100% darkness with a sleep mask or blackout curtains and tape etc and it has a major effect on bringing you down.

And basically avoid anything that is agitating or over stimulating, except for your internal symptoms, don't turn away or try to avoid those, embrace them and accept them, stay with it, and while it won't cure the mania it will make you less agitated, so you can stay safe and make better decisions. 

Of course, let your doctor know your symptoms have changed and check in with your team and let them know you need some support. If you really feel like you are going to lose control go to where you can get mental health treatment, maybe they can give you a temporary medication to help bring you down, that kind of thing. 

Take some deep breaths, get centered how ever you can, so you can have a space to say ok what's my plan what's my next step, don't let things get away from you get with your people and make a plan.

I'm glad you've found medicine that works. I personally have just come to the conclusion that I'm bi polar type 1 (undiagnosed) after having the second manic episode of my life. I'm 28 and the episodes were 7 years apart, so it was tough figuring it out... Because I only go through manic episodes so infrequently, I'm struggling with the decision to experiment with medicine, or see if I can manage it by myself. 

As for perception of people with the disorder and media's depiction of people like us, well to be honest I think we are broken human beings. It's almost like we are animals living in a society that we never adapted to. I feel like these disorders would be advantageous if we were wild animals without civilization. But in a society, our brains don't really work right. Medication can help some people and that's great, but I find it difficult to come up with an argument that we should be looked at as similar to people without the disorder.

Also, him going off his meds and spiralling might have been portrayed with some accuracy but it was so fucking predictable. Of course the mentally ill person wants to go off their meds.

I've had depressive moods on and off and periods of very early waking since I was 12. I'm not sure what else I can attribute to being hypomanic until I came out as trans at 19 and began to feel much happier and energetic but I also noticably lost a ton of weight(I was obese from childhood honestly) and never gained it back after a year. It wasn't until COVID hit, screwing over my little routine entirely that I began to recognize that maybe my mood fluctuations weren't just me being very happy and excitable about things for weeks on end, that my early awakenings weren't just me waking up and failing to fall back asleep, or that my depression and intrusive/suicidal thoughts weren't just me being 'edgy and cool.'

I love it when my hypomania kicks in; sure, I might be a bit of a chatterbox, I might overspend a tad, and I might not sleep well, but I get a lot done generally, and I feel much better about myself and my ambitions.

But I'd give it up in a heartbeat if it meant the depression and anxiety stopped too, because I do not find depression ""calming"" or a way to 'settle down'. I get intrusive thoughts telling me to do terrible things, I become convinced that everyone's watching me and secretly hates me, that they're all plotting against me. That I'm worthless and all my ambitions and hobbies are worthless and will never accomplish anything. I had to have stable me hide a karambit knife my brother gave me when he moved out, so depressive me wouldn't try to cut again, and even though I've never drawn blood when trying to self-harm, if I keep it up, there will be a day when I do. I love myself, my family, my friends, my girlfriend and other partners, and the dreams my girlfriend and I share of getting married and adopting children together too much to want to follow through.

I was WRONG.

You CAN tell people, it is no problem, but choose wisely who you tell.  The biases surrounding mental illnesses have gotten better but they are still there.

Some people got more interested in me, but it was almost as if I were a case to them more than a person.

Some didn't care and still thought of me the way I was... But were much quicker to dismiss me if I went off the norm.

Others just didn't want to hear it and it completely changed their perception of me.

DO NOT TELL too many people or else word gets around.

IF you tell some people do it in the right way.  Make it feel as special for them that you trust them enough to tell them this information.  As special as it is for you to actually say this to them.

DONT make it awkward. 

ACCEPT that they might take time to take that in.

THE BEST way to do it is to let them get to the conclusion themselves and if they bring it up you can confirm it.

YOU can drop some clues if you want.  Things like ""I think I might have a disorder"" ""I haven't felt right lately"" ""I feel pretty depressed/energetic""....

Tell as much as you want but only if you know you can trust the person.  In my experience telling someone for the most part never betters a relationship only gives you an excuse to blame the bad on.

People dont like excuses they like people who dont need excuses.

Really just be yourself and accept you will do some STUPID or even crazy things and mess up relationships. 

It will happen, the only thing you can do is try to be as ""sane"" and level headed as you can and just try to fit in or stand out in the best ways.

There's no one right answer and for the person you are thinking of telling, they may be happy to know.  Everyone is different and you just gotta do what you think is best.

I read, or maybe it was a lyric in a song, hmmm I think it was a song lyric but not fully sure.... ""Remember no night lasts for ever"", or something like that, and that's one I try to remind myself of, not that it always works.

What really doesn't help for me at the moment is that, *I think*, there is still things I'd like to do, but due to either avpd, or me being a complete and utter coward, I cannot cope with the embarrassment of being out in public to do any of these, especially on my own and getting involved in groups or clubs really doesn't appeal. The times I've been involved in clubs in the past has always been the same, in that the club ends up becoming some petty power struggle between 2 or more groups inside the club, and I just really cannot be bothered to get involved in such childish, petty, time wasting. Though sometimes I wonder if the possible interest in some activities is because I cannot get out to do these and would I actually do them if I could, so it's all rather confusing.

At the moment I'm surrounded by so much that's partially started and not finished, my landlord keeps muttering about selling the house and not selling, then he is, then he isn't. It almost seems to be that every time I try to get something actually done and finished he suddenly turns up and starts saying about people interested in buying the house. At one point I had 24 hours notice that I was possible to be moving out the next week to a ratty place (yes I know it's illegal, but what can you do at times without making the situation worse), only for that to never happen, my spare room is half full of partially packed boxes just in case (or rather when) I do have to move. I've really lost all drive and ability to get anything done anymore....no I cannot afford to move out n my own as the majority of places these days are all via agencies and they all refuse to accept people on benefits even ones that are lifelong disabled, there's almost no private landlords left in the UK these days. I'm on the council list for possible properties, but as a single bloke, I'm right down the bottom of the list at all times.

There's only so much I can keep struggling against, I'm worn out and there's no escape in life apart from the short time of being asleep, but that only lasts so long and that I have no choice but to wake up again.

Sorry... I really don't know what happened there, that was going to be a brief reply as I couldn't think of much to say, sorry for the extended waffle...and I really hope that you can keep hanging on and getting through the really bad times.

For the second paragraph, yes yes yes. Medicine helps. Drs help. Avoiding drugs and alcohol helps. I liked being alone because people upset me. Unfortunately, no one can predict it for a person.

Some things that helped occasionally. I would distract myself. I watched a lot of tv. I took it one day at a time.  I tried to avoid self criticism and judging myself.

This sounds like a classic case of a Manic Episode. Also you mention having fake conversations and this sounds like when I had my Psychotic break and began to 'give speeches' about politics. Something I had never talked about before. 

&gt;I always have moments where im like oh you are your fathers child bc I feel like him in those moments. All these unfinished or great ideas and no turnout.

I feel the same about my own father. He was an alcoholic and would work for weeks (14 hour days) then sometimes just lay in bed sleeping for days. 

I hope you get help for the self harm issues.

I once told my own therapist I thought I was bipolar but she completely dismissed this. I ended up having a Manic-Psychotic break. I went from being Bipolar 2 to Bipolar 1. 

Please stress to your therapist your symptoms and why you think you're Bipolar. And try to find a Psychiatrist in your area. They have more experience with mood disorders. 

&gt;but I know its something that isn't situational and incredibly out of my control.

Please seek help if you feel you are in a crisis. Go to a clinic or a hospital. Mania can easily become Psychosis which is the worst thing in the world =/ Your reality breaks. You are never the same person again.

If it‚Äôs your first time don‚Äôt take more than about 120mg in total, less if you‚Äôre tiny. BE SENSIBLE. I was thrown into a very strange manic state one time last year when I was an idiot and took too much, it wasn‚Äôt pretty and I was super fucked up and stuck in the same kind of ‚Äúcracked mirror‚Äù mania for two months after that. 

Be. Sensible. The other commenters here are right, be careful and definitely look up any contraindications with your meds and if you‚Äôre taking a MAOI, DON‚ÄôT TAKE THE MDMA OR YOU‚ÄôLL DIE!!!!!

It‚Äôs my favourite drug in the entire world, it‚Äôs the best feeling I‚Äôve ever experienced. As long as you do it sensibly you‚Äôll be fine and have a good time. 

Get some gum of your favourite flavour because you‚Äôre going to want to clench or grind your teeth and you don‚Äôt want that, sip at a sports drink SLOWLY over 4-6 hours, have a small drink of water every hour or so. 

Eat lots of fruit and low fat foods during the day but stop eating 4 hours before you take it for maximum effect. I like to eat a banana and a mango for my last meal, the banana is filling and nutritious and the mango has tryptophan which is a precursor to serotonin which miiiiiiiight lead to a better high? The mango bit is debatable but I also like eating mangos so it doesn‚Äôt matter to me whether it‚Äôs really doing anything or not. 

It adds to the ritual. 

Get heap of music, make sure you‚Äôre with people you trust and love, I personally hate doing it at parties I much prefer doing it alone with my husband or with my very very closest friends. 

Make sure you don‚Äôt make a habit of it. It‚Äôs not physically addictive in the way that nicotine is, but you‚Äôll have very minor cravings after doing it. Leave a minimum of 3 months in between doing it. My trick is to anchor it to life events like our wedding anniversary and our birthdays. We cut down from 4x a year to 2x a year early last year because I felt like I was chasing the dragon and I was starting to get diminishing returns after three years of doing it every 3 months. So we made new rules and decided to take the human distance predatory approach and just keep jogging after the dragon, waiting for it to collapse out of exhaustion THEN stabbing it to death rather than trying to catch it in a sprint. It‚Äôs working well, I appreciate it more and I‚Äôm getting to the level I want to be at.

Be sensible. Chew gum. Don‚Äôt take more than 120mg for your first time. If they‚Äôre going to hand you some sketchy pill take 1/4 and see how you feel and wait a minimum of 30-45 minutes before taking more. Don‚Äôt be a hero and take the whole thing no matter what your friends say. Pressed pills could be any amount and could be ANYTHING so be. sensible. You‚Äôll be able to feel it when it‚Äôs time to redose, make sure you only do this once while you‚Äôre getting a feel for it. You‚Äôll want to do more and more but make sure you don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs where it goes wrong and you mess your brain up. 

MDMA is one of my favourite things in the entire world but it‚Äôs not worth cooking your brain over. Be deliberate about how you‚Äôre doing it and you‚Äôll be ok. Look up a list of foods that have lots of tryptophan and make sure you eat as many of them as you can the day after you do it and for the week following so you can mitigate any sads that come your way. But if you take a sensible amount you‚Äôll be much much less likely to crash out when coming down. More often that not I experience a nice gentle glide from pure euphoria on the night back to baseline over about a week because I have a VERY regimented way of doing it.

Stay safe and good luck! Send me a PM on the night and I‚Äôll happily chat with you, you‚Äôll have a desperate need to call all of your friends and tell them you love them.

* No selfies or human family pics, youtube channels, discord links, personal blogs. 
This also includes requests for research participants and any self-promotion/donation 
links    

* No memes or infographics link posts unless it's Friday

* No ""why did my bipolar SO/coworker/ex/parent/staff/boss do this?"" type posts. Short 
answer: No idea. Ask them or talk to a therapist about it. 

* Be kind to fellow users. No harassment or abusive language will be tolerated. Report

* We are not Drs so please don't post asking us if you have BP. You wouldn't ask a 
cancer support group if you have cancer, so please don't ask us. 

* Please report self-harm and suicide threats. Users aren't equipped to intervene. 

Most of all be kind to yourself. We have a really great piece of the internet due to

Have you reached out to accessibility? 
Generallly, those counsellors are useless, sorry guys! They are basically trained to be like crisis counselling a la read-from-a-script 
Also designed to be short term 
Bipolar is a lifelong illness (as you know) 
Call your campus‚Äô medical clinic and ask for an appointment with the school psychiatrist! They will help you (with medication advice and with appropriate next steps). 
Accessibility can also give advice and is ready with ling lists of resources. 
They will also help you arrange accommodations with your professors - this is VERY helpful in the way of extensions. 
I would not have been able to complete my degree without them. 
Be VERY honest about where you are and do your best to keep accessibility in the loop.

There are the scientific, objective natural facts of reality, and the rest is up to you, what modules of your evolved brain you are going to run them through.

If we didn't lose insight during depression, if we knew we were just depressed and it was our mood that was biasing us, it wouldn't have evolved, it wouldn't work. Just like if pain didn't actually hurt, we wouldn't be careful. But it can become disordered and stuck on, which is just a weakness of the system, but we still feel very compelled to believe in the psychosis of depression that this all means something, and has to, therefore...

If I didn't work at ACT and DBT and CBT and most importantly trauma therapy, there's no way I could have rewired my brain to defuse with my thoughts and alter my consciousness. I've been on lithium around that long, and I've had a different experience, but I haven't had a girlfriend or much of life outside a few friends, I've been working on this stuff.

And I think you'll be OK. We have a storytelling brain, if we didn't believe in our stories we might not move or do anything at all. But we also have the ability to say ""that's just a story"" ""that's just a thought"" and focus our consciousness on something else. And that think becomes our reality. All that shit sounds stupid and hokey to your story telling brain. When you are somewhere way at the peak of your prefrontal cortex just your true self seeing what it is to be a primate, you realize that's just the way it is. Stories are temporary, values are forever. I express my values every day and I don't feel like killing myself anymore, when I fail to, the needle goes the other way. Finding a way to express your values every day in a way that makes a difference will carry you, you just have to find a way to devalue the story you're believing in right now.

As far as meds go have you heard the diabetes analogy? Diabetics cannot just take the same dose of insulin daily and expect to be well. They have to constantly monitor their blood sugar and adjust accordingly. It's the same with bipolar. We have to constantly monitor our symptoms and adjust accordingly. I'm prescribed 500-800mg of Seroquel daily. I normally take 550-600. If I'm feeling sluggish and numb I can skip 50-100 during the day. If I'm anxious, irritated, or not sleeping I can take extra.

I don't think it was meant to hurt but it's definitely a micro aggression that was entirely unnecessary (been there done that).

When it comes to the subreddit (without having looked at many of the threads), I'm genuinely happy that community exist as a place where SOs can get support. Living with someone who has bipolar can mean a thousand different things, but just as having bipolar can be a struggle, it can be a struggle to be the SO, or just a struggle not knowing how to best be supportive. There's also a lot of stigma towards bipolar that will target our SOs as well. It doesn't matter if it's comparable to our struggles or not, it is still there and I'm happy there's a place for them to talk about these things.

Having read the moderator's answer to this specific thread as well as comments in another thread about their rules and how they can be improved, I don't have the impression that this is a stance that is widely shared. The moderator do want us to feel welcome there. As I understand from looking at it now (and I could be wrong), they've both had incidents of SOs going in there to basically trash talk their bipolar partner as well as people with bipolar going in there to invalidate the SOs feelings and telling them to suck it up and be more supportive. In both cases likely combined with typing in the heat of the moment and misunderstandings.

I understand if the post made in there feels stigmatizing and I feel the same.

Due to me already having an issue with it, my brain tells me that it can't get better, possibly adding a level of placebo that I can't break my brain/subconscious self out of, unfortunately. He locks on to things like that too much for me to help him break through.

Not only that, but with Lithium potentially increasing cytokine production, and me already being immuno-compromised from infleximab, it serious triggers an emotional drop, as well as with covid's main mechanism of action being a cytokine storm. Even typing this out is spiraling me downwards and without being on the Lithium, I would absolutely have an emotional melt down. But if being on it is a serious trigger right now, why subject myself to that for 3 months, when I could take a couple weeks trying something else with the possibility of working? I really do not have 3 months of time to have things up in the air, with potential for change afterwards. I'm in my early twenties and still working on my highschool, if I don't get that done soon, everything I have planned is completely gone. I understand my mental health is important, and that taking a comparitively small amount of time to get the right thing figured out will significantly better me in the overall long run, but taking 3-5 weeks to try a few different meds is about all the (already stretched) 'extra' time I have. However, I would like to reiterate again that I absolutely know my stability is the most important thing, and if I can not find something that works well for me, I will absolutely go back on lithium.

In regards to the salt and water, that's interesting. I have however been already adding extra of both of those before even being on lithium. It has not, unfortunately, and it's been a fair few days. For me, /personally/, at least. I did try some mag citrate as well, as it normally really helps with muscle screwieness, but to not much avail.

If you think I'm wrong, or making a bad decision with anything I've said, please do tell me. I enjoy being wrong, as it provides a route to grow. I would however appreciate an explanation on why.

Untreated bipolar long term does cause cognitive decline, and so for most people it just involves weighing the pros and cons. I wish there were more concrete studies about the long term (30+ years) use of mood stabilizers.

There has been no quantitative evidence for bipolar causing dementia, just correlation. No one knows if it's because of the disease itself, risky behaviors common in bipolar patients such as drug use, or medications.

The interesting part here is that typically only recollection, working memory and cognition are affected. Spatial abilities, social affect, and recognition were not impaired. Which is SUPER interesting, because spatial pattern recognition is primarily dopaminergic. (More on that later)

In my experience, anti psychotics are what I need because my (hypo)mania is essentially constant low-grade psychosis. TD is much less common with modern neuroleptics, such as quetiapine and risperidone. For example, halperidol is basically never used continuously or as monotherapy except for classic schitzoaffective. Most often prescribed PRN for bipolar. Quetiapine and risperidone are commonly used as replacement mood stabilizers.

This is what concerns me. There is very little research on long term use of anti-psychotics as either monotherapy or as a primary continuous component of treatment. Psychiatrists are not typically well versed in pharmacology, and will use prescriptions as they are taught to. Atypical neuroleptics block the dopamine D2 pathways.

My boss at the store I just left looked at me like I had 3 heads and I felt myself going in circles trying so I'm kinda scared to talk about it.

ECT vastly improved my symptoms for sure, but it didn't make me as happy as I thought I would be. It's just a level baseline now. TMS made me feel better, maybe a little hypomanic, but overall happier.

The memory loss was pretty bad and remains a problem honestly. I did 15 bilateral treatments, I've heard unilateral isn't as bad about that.

I've also been struggling with very strange vivid dreams and nightmares.

I'm having this weird sense now that I feel violated by ECT. It just made me wonder - What did I do to deserve this? Why did I agree to this? It seems almost traumatic to me now. I'm really bitter that it happened.

Her anger really triggers me, even when it's not directed at me. I've told her, but it happens anyways, and if I speak up about the actions aggravating my symptoms, I'm dismissed as being controlling and bossy.  Sorry I can't help but I can appreciate it. 

P.s. Actually though in some cities there are some rape crisis hotlines that you can call 24 hours a day. It doesn't have to be a full blown crisis, some are more like warm lines where you can talk out your feelings, sometimes I call to talk about my rape-related ptsd symptoms, or just general rape-related issues I'm not comfortable discussing with friends or family. You can call at any time, whether it happened 5 min ago or 10 years ago. I used to call every night a few years ago, now that I'm doing better about once every two months. I highly recommend looking up the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center hotline if you don't have a local one. They have saved my life so many times, and are always helpful in one way or another, and they don't ask where you are/live. They let you talk for up to roughly 25 min, then they have to go but they'll help you make a safety or coping plan for the rest of the day or night.

I know it seems all cliche but manic/hypomanic episodes rise up with stress and sleep loss. Make sure to get enough sleep and have a schedule for it. Try to go to bed and get up at the same hours. This will help the meds adjust and also help you in treatment. 

I have a psychiatrist who also does psychotherapy sessions so that is also helpful. I tell my doctor about how it really is, I never lie and underestimate. That is a must, you cannot lie to people helping you. 

It is helful to get help before the term starts because mood stabilizers lower the effects of stimulants and overdosage of stimulants may awaken mania. Give yourself 1-2 weeks to let the meds adjust, if you can. That adjustment period may be hard when you are trying to follow lectures but try to stay positive. You can do this.

I can never use normal calendars so try to find a way to change them into something you can actually use. I use glittery highlighters because I bought them with my own earned money and they make me happy to use. 

Don't be afraid to fuck up. You can and will fail and so what? I got 52 in a midterm worth 20% of my grade and still managed to get an A. I am not saying this because I am being arrogant, I am saying this because I have seen my friends give up and honestly as people with both ADHD and bipolar, we are at a huge disadvantage. We have to work harder, sometimes fuck up worse than others and make it work. 

Last thing, you have to believe in yourself and your abilities. I know it may be hard to because of past experiences but you can do it. If this is your goal, you can do it.

And if you fail, you know that you tried. Having a bath is trying, combing your hair is trying and doing a single worksheet worth %0.05 of your grade is also trying.

Hi! I get the not being able to seek help thing. Even though my parents would have been understanding, I really didn‚Äôt want to talk about it and insurance was in their name. So I kinda ‚Äúsucked it up‚Äù until after college. It was probably not the right thing to do because college was VERY rough with depression, but my point is that I understand the struggle and feeling alone.

My biggest advice from a seasoned bipolar veteran (kinda kidding, am in late 20s):

1. Make a depression plan. For example, I have positive notes to myself that I can look at. Whenever I feel lousy and worthless, I look at them and am reminded that I did achieve things, I do have potential, and my life is decent. Even neutral things like ‚ÄúI own shampoo‚Äù, ‚ÄúI see trees and trees are pretty‚Äù, and ‚ÄúI like the earrings I‚Äôm wearing‚Äù can be so nice and distracting and positive. 

Part 2 of depression plan- set up your environment. Candles! Non-dying plants like bamboo! A good smelling soap. Set it up when you‚Äôre feeling okay-ish and you got this.

2. Yeah, bipolar sucks, even the good moods. I always start feeling good but then just can‚Äôt turn my thoughts off. The lack of control makes me upset. If it‚Äôs more hypomania and not mania, then you still have control of yourself, don‚Äôt forget that. You can put away credit cards, ask a friend to look after you, or channel your energy into something productive or creative.

3. Look for opportunities for counseling or online self-help books or meds. College has free counseling usually, for example. They might help you with meds from a normal doctor checkup or maybe free clinic, which might go unnoticed on insurance and not reported to parents (if that‚Äôs the issue, idk). It might not happen for a while but don‚Äôt completely discount it.

There‚Äôs probably a ton more stuff but I‚Äôm glad you found this subreddit, I hope it‚Äôs helpful! I think everyone here likes to be supportive so don‚Äôt be afraid to ask. Feeling alone is super common and this helps. Even the most understanding people in my life don‚Äôt always understand.

Makes one approx. 25-30 cm pizza

Preheat oven to 230C

Wash and dry small head of cauliflower 
Cut off the florets (you don‚Äôt need much stem)
Pulse in food processor for 30 seconds until its like powdery snow (alternatively use a cheese grater if you don‚Äôt have a processor)
Cover and micro-wave cauliflower for 4 minutes
Dump cooked cauliflower onto a clean tea towel and let cool
Squeeze as much water as possible out of cauliflower mixture

Add:
1/4 cup parmesan cheese
1/4 mozzarella cheese
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried basil (crush up more between fingers)
1/2 teaspoon garlic power
1 egg

Once mixed together, use your hands to form the dough into a crust on your oiled parchment paper. Pat it down throughly, you want it nice and tightly formed together. Don't make it too thick or thin either.

Bake for 8 - 11 minutes (until kind of golden brown)

However, I do have a lot of guilt over times I've tried to, and it's gone wrong.

Please don't refer to this as a first-world problem, it's so reductive and emotion and the need to be loved and understood is such an important part of life, you shouldn't feel selfish or shallow for wanting that.

I am glad you have found someone you feel you can be honest with without judgement, it's not easy to put up with us as I'm sure you are aware. I hold the belief that only people who have experience with a topic can truly understand, put up with, and support another with it, so that's good for you.

I am a little concerned you are taking this very quickly. Some relationships run very intensely and burn out quickly, hopefully that isn't what's happening here.

My best (only remaining) friend is engaged to a girl who basically moved in with him after a month of dating, and they seem very happy, so it can work out.

I would suggest setting up video calls if you haven't already just in case WA does get locked down though, always best to have these things in place, just make sure you've agreed on times to call so you don't start to feel like you're bothering her.

I completely get the "" wasting chunks of people's lives "" thing, I hold the same mentality towards long-term dating, but it is important to not rush into something, too.

From my experience, you tend to find those who have had harder lives tend to do 1 of 2 things in relationships: 

1. Emotionally distance themselves to prevent further pain
2. Dive headfirst in

There's a good middleground in there which is the best road to take, I'm permanently stuck in position 1 in that respect unfortunately.

If you really do feel like you have met your perfect person, I suggest doing something I do when manic, write every thought down, every one, then wait until you come down back to baseline or even in a drop, then read it all back to yourself and see which bits you still agree with, that should help you filter out which bits are you, and which bits are mania.",,1585473519,{},flthu2y,False,t3_fqtbw0,False,True,t1_flspcu7,/r/bipolar/comments/fqtbw0/i_am_always_skeptical_of_myself_because_of_my/flthu2y/,1585473519,1,True,False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,0,,,,,,

I've slept glorious three hours and feel like shit but she is save, thats important for the moment.

I've been on the phone with her parents for about an hour and more and more information come together about what happened over the last couple of months. It is unbelievable.

As it turns out she snapped in late january after quitting her meds (Abilify, Seroquel to help her sleep) because some dipshit self called shaman took advantage of her situation. She was self employed and doing well but was never happy with her meds and tried to find natural ways of medication. So this shaman convinced her to try a combination of medical marihuana and a sort of herbal tea.

As soon as she snapped she suddenly had a lot of new ""friends"". They basically lived in her house and thats when the situation began to worsen everyday. She started consuming cocain, speed and mdma and began to take money out of her business accounts to spoil her newfound friends and her own drug abuse. 

According to her father she blew through 100 000 ‚Ç¨ in two and a half months. He is now in controll of her business and managed to get a look at her accounts.

If you and others are concerned about what comes in the future, that's worth a group conversation but not if it includes any mention of bipolar. Even if you're right, even if you see it clearly, any mention at all is out of bounds. So by that, treat them like you'd treat anything but very specifically without mentioning a disorder. 

Consider the hypothetical, the person is appearing to ride high but then you find out they're struggling with amphetamines. How might you treat their behavior if that ended up being the case? Would it be a direct question? Would it be a group discussion? And where's the line on that? At what point do you say, OK now we're having a talk. And if you did have that talk, are you going to lead with, we think you're on amphetamines. Of course not. It should always be centered on very specific instances of failing. 

My point to you is that if you frame this in your thinking as, ""I see a potential issue. I think it's bipolar. I should do something but I don't know what,"" then you're a hammer looking for a nail with all the potential downsides of what I wrote. If you instead treat the person as an equal and have a set of evidence showing, in instances ABC there was harm to the organization and our mission, then it really doesn't matter what the cause is. Your responsibility is not responding to cause but to consequence and until there is one that merits saying something, then there's nothing to say. And by that, bipolar is not what should be focused on. 

Perhaps the strength of my tone is driven in part that you posed this question on the bipolar subreddit. Again, no hate on you. It's clear you're trying to do right by someone. My encouragement is, why does this have to be about bipolar? And if it is, why are you treating it differently? And if you're not, why post it here? Do you see what I'm getting at? Your heart is right but your approach seems a little too focused on bipolar and insufficiently focused on harmful behavior. When that line gets crossed, if it does, and you need to be making business/organization calls for the good of the mission, then especially then bipolar should not be brought up.

I want to be careful about NOT jumping from possible hypo to doing something, without first coming to a space where I can ask people with bipolar questions about the issue.

The fact is, if someone were not sleeping without exhibiting any other possible hypo symptoms, that alone would be enough to raise concern and ask them if they needed anything like a workload reduction or a check-in.

1. my sex drive fluctuates with my highly managed cycles, so even if I'm not feeling that down, I can still see 5-6 month spells where I've just got nothing, not interested. 

2. I'm not 18 anymore and it's unrealistic to think I'll fuck like an 18 year old. Now, I have the vast sexual wisdom of a man pushing 40, and I think the trade off is quality over quantity. An 18 year old can lay it down all day but they suck at it. For you guys in your relationship, that's probably not what your wife wants anyway. Instead, she probably jut wants to be desired, and there's lots of ways to show desire. That could be worth some further contemplation.

3. Idk how long you've been married but for sure after 7 years in marriage, my ex was far less sexually appealing just because I'd been with her for so long. There's a part of this I think that is just normal human stuff. So that could lead you to exploring how other couples (regardless of bipolar) deal with that. 

4. In the immortal words of Wyclef Jean, ""Fellas if you need help use ginseng."" Find some raw ginseng and make tea every morning. Small cup of boiling water, put the powdered raw ginseng in it, steep, slurp it down. Do that for a couple weeks, you'll feel something. It sparks desire, or at least, it helps me when I want it. 

5. To her comment, ""easier to do it on her own."" Nothing wrong with that. In fact, a woman enters her sexual prime right about the time men are leaving it, and that's just human. Get her some toys or whatever, designate personal time, if you guys are committed to each other and she just wants to get off, I think that's a pretty reasonable thing, as a component of other things.

[],,Write_What_I_Like,,,[],,,,text,t2_17fnng,False,False,[],"There's a secret meaning to suicidal ideation and desire. It's not obvious, but for bipolars in particular, it is true. Suicidal desires for us are a desire for control. At its core, bipolar is an absence of control. We simply cannot regulate how we feel and by that, everything feels out of control. And when that drives you mad enough, you start to think, on some level, if I can't control anything else, I can control how it ends. Right now, we're in a space where we have very little control over things - our routines, our safety, our ability to go out in the world, all of it is out of our control. And that stacks up on top of bipolar. 

I understand the desire to die. I lived in that space for many years. What I realized since is that when I focus my energy on seizing control of every aspect of my life (to the degree I can), it helps quiet that skipping record of wanting to die. It might not go away entirely, but it makes a big difference. Some ideas on how to seize control:

\- Force a new routine - write down your entire day by the hour or even every 30 min before you live that day. Wake at the same time, eat at the same time, shower, TV show, reddit, etc. All of it scheduled. 

\- Control your environment by making it pristine clean. Like run-a-white-glove-and-there's-no dust level clean. This helps order your mind, gives you an ordered space in which to live, gives you something to focus on and gives you total control of what's around you. 

\- Control your health, to the degree you can. Exercise, control your diet, control your sleep, take total command on your body. Treat it like trying to remember to breathe. Seize control over it all directly.

\- Take your meds. Always take meds. 

I'm sure others have tips and tricks. Get creative with it, but reframe the desire to die as actually a desire to have control. And then take that control relentlessly, unapologetically, ruthlessly. Keep fighting, stay connected with people here. Everyone is always ready to talk.

\- You do not have the knowledge necessary to actually conclude what you're seeing is hypomania. It could be that, or it could family, or drugs, or another disorder, or none of the above. It could be anything. Hypomania looks like a lot of stuff and even a doctor would require vastly more info than just observing behavior. You note you don't have a real personal relationship - the guts of bipolar ONLY can be revealed through personal description. So, that right there, you should stop. 

\- If you say something to this person or to HR and your only statement is, this person might be hypo we must get them help, you are FUCKING that person for good. Since you're with someone who is bp, you understand the stigma and how it can end careers and relationships - or at the very least, shade them permanently. If this person is bipolar, you're effectively outing them, even if you say it privately. And if they are not bipolar, you're throwing a huge stigma on them that all of us are trying to overcome. And on that, if this person is, for example, using drugs and you say, bipolar! well then you've just contributed to perpetuating the stigma. 

\- If you're in this decision making role and you are making the jump from ""possible hypo"" to ""I need to do something about this,"" dude, you ARE the stigma, walking and breathing. Unless this behavior is impacting the quality of the work, wtf does it matter? If someone has ADD and has to work extra hard to concentrate or if someone has autism and works harder or -INSERT DISABILITY HERE- and works harder, what does it matter if it's not impacting their work? Unless you're thinking, uh-oh, bipolar we better be careful here, then you are someone who makes the stigma continue. I don't think you mean to do that but that's the truth of it. 

\- If the person is bipolar and you out them, there's no respectful way to do that. They will get extremely self conscious and will expend huge amounts of energy trying to figure out what gave them away, while also hating themselves, while also then doing any of the 1000 things we do just to live with this fucking disorder. Again, you're in a relationship with someone who is bipolar, so just imagine, what if someone outed your SO, what would that do to them psychologically? I think by virtue of you having that more personal insight, you have a much higher responsibility to tread so lightly that you do nothing at all. 

\- Let's say the person is bipolar but they don't know it and you speak to them about it. What, are you going to drive this person to the hospital, this person with whom you have no personal relationship? Are you going to give them resources to educate themselves? If that's the case and they are unknowingly bipolar, man, that's not your fucking business. That's about the most intimate and private thing ever and if you have enough awareness to see it and they don't, then you should show the utmost respect and leave it alone. They'll figure it out in time. 

I see that you want to help and do what's right. Here's my bottom line. If someone is not bipolar, they don't get to contribute or speak about it. They get to listen and support as the person they told wants them to. Anyone who is not bipolar is a GUEST in bipolar discussions, which means they must be invited. If you are not bipolar and you have not been invited, then saying anything at all is disrespectful. Being with someone who is bipolar is insufficient for you to join the club. You do not get a membership pass. And in terms of your colleague, I think the only right move is leave it alone.

a) Red is associated with danger, passion, lust...

b) Green is associated with balance, peace, groundedness...

c) Blue is associated with ""being blue""

d) Black is associated with darkness, fear, death...

a) The red looks like a sky on fire with a sunrise or sunset

I use weed to help me sleep. But if I smoke weed all day (like I've been doing during quarantine) it stops working. It does not help me go to sleep so I had a few days where I was hypomanic and I could not get to sleep at all. I'm working on using weed more medicinally instead of recreationally, such as ""taking it"" at the same time everyday. 

Weed doesn't help me with depression. It holds me back from doing the things I need to do to help alleviate the sadness. When I smoke weed, I self-isolate. But sometimes I'm just mentally exhausted and weed is my blankey so I can just take several days off from life and just check-out. 

In the research that I've done, smoking flower or a tincture that is made from whole flower is more medicinal, they call it ""full-spectrum"" rather than smoking tinctures that are pure THC extracts.

If you don‚Äôt have one already, I recommend getting a mood tracking app, they‚Äôre a good idea in general and invaluable when you‚Äôre adjusting your meds. They really make it so much easier to judge how a medication is affecting you in the event that you get lost inside your own head.

I agree with Jay Harn that it takes work. Being bipolar is a lifelong illness, but if you learn more about it, you will learn to live with it. Don't fear or dread it, instead try to understand it and it will get better. Find alternatives to a therapist if you can't afford one. Meds alone are not enough. I'd tell you what alternatives are available but I don't know which part of the world you are from. Different countries have different healthcare systems.

Mental/verbal abuse, or any other form of abuse, definitely requires a therapist. It's OK if you can't afford a therapist now. Deal with your bipolar first. One thing at a time! Besides, it's easier to deal with abuse when your bipolar is in check.

For the record, I am doing well now in terms of mental health. There still is room for improvement, but my point is that it can be done. Being bipolar or experiencing abuse doesn't seal your fate in any way.

1. Call his last doctor's office. Many offices are operating via telehealth appointments, he might even be able to speak to his own doctor, which would be better than a stranger if they had a good relationship. When you call let them know he is *experiencing a crisis*, they may be able to adjust his meds over the phone. I see in another comment of yours that he is taking Paxil regularly and only Zyprexa as needed - I would ask them specifically if he should continue taking Paxil given his manic state, SSRIs are known to cause/exacerbate mania (but *do not stop* unless a doctor advises it, it could make things worse)


2. Call your city/county/state crisis line. They can help you find resources and advise you on when to seek emergency care, and also let you know if there are behavioral health urgent care walk-in services available. The ER can definitely help him if he is a danger to himself or others, which if he has lost touch with reality he may be.


3. Call your local NAMI affiliate - this number is for Greater Orlando but they can redirect you if needed 800-950-6264.


4.

If you have any of the latter, then IMO, you need to be in a hospital so that you are safe and should be checking yourself in. 

Talk to your clinicians about this. Be honest about the thoughts you are having, how you feel about them, and whether or not you have the desire/means to make them real. Their job is to assess the level of your risk, and they can't do that with incomplete information. Ask for help with understanding the thoughts. It is possible to talk to clinicians about suicidal thoughts without being whisked into a hospital.",,1591364734,{},fsz01we,False,t3_gwylo8,False,True,t3_gwylo8,/r/bipolar/comments/gwylo8/ive_started_thinking_about_suicide_sporadically/fsz01we/,1591364735,1,True,False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,0,[],,,,,

[],,FakingItSucessfully,,,[],,,,text,t2_10okuyxs,False,False,[],"I'm not trying to contradict or invalidate your opinion... I agree actually. And you also said already you mostly wanted to vent. But I'll offer another perspective though...

First of all, what you're referring to is absolutely real and it's bullshit. Lots of people DO just identify with compelling portrayal's of mental illness and chime in that it's ""SOO Me!"" without thinking at all that they're piling on and making things worse. They do it with all sorts of identities/disorders... maybe the most flagrant is people who throw around being OCD just because they appreciate an organized cupboard or something. Like do you not get that some people's lives are measurably harder because they CAN'T stop from making an unreasonably big deal out of this in their heads? That's not an opportunity to get some attention... but a lot of people lack that awareness.

Next up on my list, since Bipolar Disorder specifically has a large genetic component, it follows that there are a lot of people with a family history and some of the traits, in maybe a weaker form, who have some of the characteristics but maybe never experience them strongly enough to get diagnosed. I think it'd be valid for those people to see themselves in the descriptions... still should be sensitive about chiming in and hijacking the convo, but all I'm saying is there are a lot of people who can legitimately identify with the disorder even if they don't full have it.

Finally, one of my good friends has a similar beef, but about autism/asperger's, and how people claim that identity and have self-diagnosed but haven't ever gotten officially diagnosed. But the problem is, number one back to the previous point, some people can have some identifiable tendencies even if it's not pronounced enough to rank as an actual disorder. And secondly, therapists/psychiatric personnel qualified to give an official diagnosis aren't cheap... not everyone has access to that kind of resource to be able to get an official diagnosis. Hell, having ASD or BPD bad enough probably makes you LESS likely to be able to afford to make it official.

Self-Diagnosis is risky, and doing it publicly and for attention is a jerk-hole move. But sometimes it's the only option for people that do legitimately belong. Personally, I am officially bipolar, but also I mentioned during my Psych checkups one time that I've long suspected I also have some level of Autism-Spectrum Disorder, and can we talk about that? My doctor at the time was literally just like ""oh... yeah no you totally don't have that."" And that was that. I still want to get actually diagnosed some day, but even when I DID have the privilege to have access to the resource, sometimes the door is still shut. Particularly for women, ASD can be very hard to diagnose correctly (and this is well off your point so forgive me, hopefully it's still illustrative), since some levels of ASD looks a lot like how females are simply expected to behave.

Anyway, that's probably enough. I hope I haven't made your poor feelings even worse... I do totally agree that it's really harmful to have people throw around labels with little to no understanding, and especially claim a disorder that is borderline ruining some of our lives by the day, simply because they feel a bit less insecure to have a name for their idiosyncrasies. But hopefully we can acknowledge that AND be open minded that some of the people in our community aren't able to do better than self-diagnosis, and they probably need our support even more than usual.",,1591364355,{},fsyzdxy,False,t3_gx35jb,False,True,t1_fsyszad,/r/bipolar/comments/gx35jb/tiktok_glorifying_bipolar/fsyzdxy/,1591364356,1,True,False,bipolar,t5_2qnv4,0,[],,,,,
