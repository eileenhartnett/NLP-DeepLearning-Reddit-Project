Many work on a sliding scale.  You don’t say how many years you have suffered but it’s never too late to recover and don’t give up!  Life is so much better without suffering under the demon.  If your parents know, they should support your recovery and that means helping you get therapeutic help. This is key. 
In the meantime.  The addict’s voice in your head sounds like “I want this, let’s figure out how to get this, image eating this, I want all of that...” etc.  etc.  you get the picture. Each time you hear that voice, yell back as loud as you can “You are a liar!” Build up to “You are not me, so get out of here and leave me alone! No liars allowed!”  This has actually been proven to be highly effective. There is a lot more to this, though, a lot of emotions to work through and it doesn’t happen overnight. Medication helped me too. 
Your parents are not respecting your boundaries. By affecting what you eat they are adding to an already complicated situation. You are unable to hear your body’s hunger signals and satiation. You probably don’t know what a normal portion size is for someone of your build and activity level. You won’t know that for some time after recovery. Your parents have to stay out of your way. You don’t say what kind of relationship you have with them but it sounds co-dependent which sucks. Find something else to do with your dad every day except eat. Take a walk.

I was in recovery from about 11 to 13 but I was very strict and would eat a set meal plan a day and certain exercise routine. During this period I did not attend therapy, and I never really liked it.

The demand thing is hard for me to grasp, but I see how it helped you. Any advise on the complex situation above would be wonderful. I would also like to note that my father has an interesting relationship with food, and when I was first diagonosed with anorexia from like 10-12 b/p type, the only reason he wanted me to recover was to have meals with me because that was his form of bonding. Now we have meals together and he buys them, though he knows I purge them up. But he is lonely and I give him company during those periods, and I guess that is all he cares about. I spend time with him outside of that still he still insists on eating those meals even if I reject several times. But with the Ed voice screaming i more often than not give in.

What you are doing will work and you will get the results that you want for a while. The problem is that with body dysmorphia you are going to eventually begin to only notice the so called faults and get to purging again. 


You can start to lose your hair and your teeth will start to erode because of the constant stomach acid  washing over them. Your gut flora will be a mess and your cause you to have bowel issues. Oh and the acid reflux is especially fun. 

You do really need to get to the bottom of the reasons behind your disorder and for that you need a good psychologist. You can shop around for one that you feel comfortable talking to. 

From a purely aesthetic point of view however, what you will do is train your body to stop losing weight or even put on weight with very few calories. So by the time you get to your mid to late 20s nothing is going to work and you will just get fatter and fatter. 

I am currently working to fix my metabolism and it sucks. I have to watch myself gain weight then eat even more just so I eat enough calories to then cut back and lose weight in a healthy way. That said I am the healthiest I have ever been in my life. 

What you can do is consult a registered dietician and a trainer. If you can find one that works as a team like mine do that's even better. Just explain to them what you want to do and I swear it is so much easier than what you are doing now. You will lose weight without the side effects. 
You are putting in a lot of work right now. That will be exactly the same amount of work with positive side effects. It works, it's not hard and you get to eat like a regular person. 

I wish I could go back to 17 and knowing what I know now.
 Working out without a plan is pointless and that is doubly true when  it comes to nutrition. Take control over both of those things. My trainers work online so I never even see them. Just review twice a week and adjust according to the results. 

Lastly, you are fantastically brave and smart for reaching out or even just venting.

I always tried to hide it but my boyfriend always questioned the vomit stuck to the side of toilet or vomit I thought I cleaned up but clearly missed. After all the time of sore throats, bad breath, puffy face, and guilt, I said fuck this. I did a lot of research, to beat addictions, because that’s what this is right? I’m addicted to hating my body. I thought maybe something was off in my head that I could fix naturally without weight gaining side effects. I found L-Dopa and began taking that along with curcumin. I was so tired of destroying my body to attempt to be skinny. I was never fat, not even slightly, but always felt soooooooooo fat.

I was also already underweight when doing that and still managed to lose 3 kg (6.6 lbs) in the first 10 days of doing multiple times and that's when the initial heart/respiratory issues appeared to be intense enough that I worried.

My advise is:

- right after purging: rince with water for several minute without brush. I usually rince and spit the water about 5 times.

- take a glass of water, put bicarbonate of sodium (1 teaspoon) and rince and spit about 5 times too. Drink 1 or 2 sips, it helps with stomach acidity.

- do not eat again, do not drink anything sweet or acidic for the next 20 minutes (no coffee, no sweetener, nothing, just good old water)

- after 20-30 minutes, brush your teeth with a soft toothbrush and repeat if needed -do not wash more than three times.

- use mouthwash if you wish

If you need to eat after purging because you're scared for your health, try to do it after the rinsing and do NOT eat anything acidic, sour or sweet. Potatoes, bread and starchy veggies are a good choice after a purge (they will make you bloat, but they are good for your stomach and digestive tract). Lukewarm water/tea with honey can also help if you experience throat pain, but make sure to brush your teeth about 20 minutes after drinking.

I have two kids. I stopped purging when I found out I was pregnant both times. Still struggled a ton while pregnant and adjusting to body changes, but was able to keep the behaviour in check while I was pregnant. Relapsed HARD postpartum trying to lose the baby weight and adjusting to the new stressors of kids. I struggled with bulimia for about 15 years, and there have been periods where I did well, and times where I didn’t. 

This may not be the response you want, but as soon as I had kids I think people just assumed I was doing well. But the reality is that having kids is a huge life change, and many of us lean on familiar coping strategies when things get tough. My husband is oblivious. Same with my family. I think they just assume weight loss postpartum is normal, and as we all know if you don’t want to get caught you can keep it hidden. I think your mom is a really good example of that. 

Also, I felt like people viewed my kids as an extension of me.. so as long as the kids are good people assume I am good. People often don’t realize that making sure children are OK often comes at a tremendous personal cost to parents.

For me, the motivation now comes where I don’t want to pass this along to my my kids, or see this modelled to them. So I make certain they don’t see it. I also make sure that I don’t all about diets, weight or anything else.

we decided to cuddle for a while but i ended up crying. he obviously wanted to know what was wrong, and that was the first time i opened up to him about my eating disorder. he knew i got a little neurotic about food, but i finally told him about the binge/purge part, some of my triggers, and just how obsessive i had become. he didn’t/doesn’t quite understand it fully, but he’s very supportive and loving. he’s grateful that i got it off of my chest and is trying to use this new knowledge to understand me and my habits better.

It won’t be in your realm of control whether or not she’s able to start recovery but you can definitely help by being a really loving, gentle and non-judgemental friend. You can also make her feel like it’s ok to talk about it (though she might not want to). 
You might even tell her that you have been o line trying to find support and here are some of the resources people found helpful:
I can’t recommend the Book and podcast ‘Brain Over Binge’ by Kathryn Hansen enough - it’s a game changer.
She can also find lots of helpful videos for free at Life With Lydia.

The bulimic behaviours won’t be able to stop until she’s able to stop/ease up on restricting. It’s ENORMOUSLY difficult to stop because it’s a mindset and your whole perspective has to shift.

I needed to be gently guided by a therapist/dietician/psychiatrist repeatedly to start to consider that I might be ok as I am. It took time and loving support and people showing me by example how to be accepting of themselves rather than telling me what to do.

The treatment is there to give you freedom and peace. Your therapist will help you overcome every scary obstacle and once you notice that bit by bit you can overcome fears, you get a taste for it. It will become exciting to tackle stuff that used to scare you.

Weight gain is not a guaranteed effect of ED treatment. Not everyone gains weight, some maintain the same weight, some people gain some weight. Then they learn to have a healthy relationship with food and they settle on the weight that is perfect for them.

Usually when I eat normally ill still have night/sleep binges but during that period I didnt. Ive been trying to do low carb since then but still have binge cycles.

One of the things that helps me most is taking vitamins/meds. My boyfriend is super into nootropics and supplements and stuff so we have a bunch that I take every day. I have some to take in the morning and at night. I have them all ready in a pill holder every week. It helps bc i take them first thing in the morning so that if I want to binge I just tell myself, ""no you took your meds already and you need to keep those down"" since its recommended that if you absolutely NEED to purge, generally try to wait at least 4-5 hours after your meds. So even if i still end up having a crappy day I don't feel the need to binge or if I do feel the need to i dont get the motivation to follow through.

for me it helps when friends compliment my outfits/hair/something i'm in control of because it takes focus off how my body looks. don't be weirdly enthusiastic about it or anything just casual comments like ""those jeans look really good on you"" or smth. probably don't comment on her body or eating habits (you probably already know this cause you struggle with an ed yourself). like think about what would trigger you and avoid saying that stuff.

I'm trying to psych myself up for not b/p for awhile (at least). I feel like the stakes are high.

I think it was a fairly large amount of blood. But, just like if you've ever seen a toddler bump their mouth, the amount looks larger because it mixed with the other fluids. I'm sure that happened to me, but it wasn't streaks or clots, it was bright red blood. My initial reaction was, ""did I just eat something red?"".

When I realized it was blood, I thought, should I lie down? Am I going to pass out? I didn't get dizzy or anything - thank goodness.

Thanks for reminding me that feeling shame shouldn't interfere with healthcare - I needed to hear that.

I'm pretty sure I've never intentionally stopped b/p before. Either I haven't had privacy or I just didn't think about it. With covid I have SO much privacy.

So sorry to hear that you’re dealing with this right now, during a pandemic getting healthcare can be hard and managing an eating disorder can seem nearly impossible. I’m not a doctor, but I’ve gone to one for a similar concern and they told me a few things to look out for with MW
How much blood did you throw up? Ppl with MW usually see a pretty large amount of blood in their vomit? Did the blood look clotted? Often times it’ll take the appearance of coffee grounds 
Another thing to watch out for is stool color, if you have MW you’ll most likely see some dark blood in your stool that’ll make it look sorta like tar 
Other tell tale symptoms are abdominal pain and dizziness. 
I know that it’s WAYYY easier said than done but in most cases a tear can heal completely on it’s own so if you’re at all able to, stopping purging for a week or two will help it improve 
In very very very rare cases, a MW tear can cause shock and hemorrhage which can be life threatening. Keep an eye on your pulse and if you’re able to, your blood pressure. I would recommend going to a doctor if the problem persists for more than 24 hours or if you start to see blood in your stool.


I also just want to let you know that while shame is a totally normal emotion to feel due to bulimia, it’s the job of your doctor to assure that you are safe and well taken care of.

I learned how to counteract that from a story I heard about Mormon Airforce soldier who wanted to take smoke breaks with his coworkers.  To stave off arguments he would pull a cigarette from a pack he'd purchased, snap one in half, throw it in the ashtray, and hang out for 7-10 minutes before going back in.

This little ritual came from being discriminated for being a non-smoker (of all things) and he eventually stated he consumed his tobacco the way he preferred and if he wasn't going to be allowed breaks, with his peers, they'd need to make a special rule either forbidding him to go outside, or requiring he inhale a lit cigarette...  Which would be super petty.

Well the logic and confidence inspired me, so I started standing up for myself, and I started correcting myself, and then others, when considering a meal wasted because... well, I consumed it in the manner I preferred.

Though I personally don't track what I eat.

Part of my personal recovery is trying to eat normal amounts of food and then seeing that I'm not instantly gaining 20 pounds in a month. My recovery means learning to trust myself and my body that I can tell when I've had enough to eat.

I also think it's important to remember that most people who maintain their weight without thinking about it is that they don't eat the same amount of calories every day. One day it might be double (a weekend with the family), another day it might be half (too busy, running around with work).

Tracking in recovery means I would try get a certain target every day, but that's counter intuitive to how I ate pre-ED. It's okay for *calories in* to fluctuate. 

It might be useful for recovery to track for a little while, to ""relearn"" how normal people eat and what normal portions look like, but eventually... that should be let go as well, or you will, in my view, remain in pseudo-recovery.",,1608237883,{},gg6fxu2,False,t3_kf0247,False,False,t3_kf0247,/r/bulimia/comments/kf0247/controversial_recovery_technique_that_healed_me/gg6fxu2/,1608262218,14,True,False,bulimia,t5_2tmc8,0,[],,,,,

It's hard to regulate the ED thoughts, and slipping into harmful behavioural patterns happens easily. You first need to make sure you're fully recovered ([helpful info](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/stages-recovery)). Setting a minimum kcal goal and allowing flexibility are important--going over your healthy goal by 100kcal one day of the week would not be a big deal to a 'dieter' with a healthy mindset, but to ED sufferers it might feel like an enormous failure. The ability to recognise when you are beginning to fall back into old patterns is essential. To reiterate, I'd implore you to consult a medical professional. This scenario is such a tricky one to navigate. I mentioned kcal counting, but many medical professionals may not recommended this approach at all. Here are some useful links:

Anyway, that's what I do:
Have everything ready BEFORE purging: water mixed with electrolyte powder near where you purge, something with carbs readily available (not packaged. I once couldn't open a pack of biscuits because I was shaking so bad. Do not panic, it will make your heart rate go even higher. Drink the electrolytes first, if you feel bad don't eat in case you faint while eating. Lay down on your left side because it helps with the regurgitation. Close your eyes, deep breaths. When you'll start feeling better in ~10', eat the carbs. I don't get out of bed, I only have that certain amount of calories. If I get up and there's more binge food, I usually end up with back to back b/p. Yes you'll still stay in bed for quite some time but you'll be feeling better and you won't be freaking out.

And if you ever consider medication, the main medication specifically for binge eating is Vyvanse. It is suuuper expensive though and hard to get. I tried to get it but my insurance didn't approve it so I got the ""generic"" brand, which is Adderall. Some other meds are Prozac and Topamax. I've tried Prozac and it didn't work for me.
The Adderall was super helpful when I first took it but I ended up ruining things on my own by going into an impulsive binge cycle. 
You can get all the therapy, medications, advice, etc in the world but none of it will matter until you yourself want to truly commit to recovering and letting go of your bad habits. The journey is incredibly tough but the end result will be worth it. It won't be easy though and you will most likely end up relapsing at least once, but that doesn't mean your progress is ruined.

They don’t make you lose weight at all unless you are severely constipated, and then it is not fat you are losing, just the weight of retained feces. Furthermore, they can cause horrible health risks-more info here https://www.rosewoodranch.com/laxative-abuse-treatment/. As the article says, laxatives don’t make you lose weight. They do not make you thinner. “Laxatives work on the large intestine. By the time waste reaches that area of the body, the small intestine has already absorbed the calories from the food consumed. The bowel movement triggered by the laxative doesn’t even contain a lot of food, fat, or calories.”

I’ve abused laxatives for over a year now. Let me tell you what happens when you do so: 

-constipation, all the time, that can only be cured with more laxatives, which only make the constipation worse. It is truly an addiction.

-gas and bloating, all the time

-dehydration and electrolyte deficiency 

-intestinal infections 

-rectal prolapse

And so much more. The cramping is painful. it’s embarrassing to constantly be trying to figure out whether you’re gonna shit yourself in public. They’re expensive-I’ve probably spent over $100 on laxatives- and they don’t make you lose weight 

If I could go back and tell myself to never start using laxatives, I’d do it without hesitation. I can’t do that, unfortunately, so I will tell you instead. Please don’t start.

[],,tinyxmochi,,,[],,,,text,t2_6cndztlo,False,False,[],"When you eat too much, sometimes throwing up seems to be the only way to make you feel better. That is why purging is really easy and can become addictive. You binge eat and then you regret it because you don't want to gain weight, then you remember that purging will get rid of what you ate, and when you step on the scale you see that you didn't gain or even lost weight. That can be really exciting right? Being able to eat whatever you want without gaining. You think that you can stop whenever because this isn't something you normally do, but you will end up getting addicted to the fact that you can eat anything without gaining. Even when you went just a little bit over your calorie limit you felt the need to purge. This is seriously a dangerous habit. First it starts with throwing up 2000 calories, then 1200, and finally it can lead to you throwing up every single thing you eat during the day. Even if its just one cookie, you could end up wanting to throw it up. 
I don't know your full eating history but you have definitely been binge eating the past couple of weeks/month. Eating to the point of being too full can make you physically and mentally uncomfortable so your brain will want to find the quickest solution. 
Honestly there isn't a fast solution to stop purging. Because if you do end up eating a lot again, you're going to feel sick and it will be really hard to resist purging. The best thing I can tell you is to do a lot of research about bulimia. Read all the negative effects and how it can permanently damage your body. 
I used to purge for like 9 years but I got myself to stop because purging makes your cheeks bloated and fat and my face fat is one of my biggest insecurities. That is honestly the only reason I managed to stop. I ""officially"" stopped 2 years ago but there are a few times where I'll end up impulsively purging because I ate way too much. Or if I got sick from drinking. But overall in the last 2 years I think I've only purged like 10 times, which is a lot better than when I used to do it almost every day. I admit that I do miss being able to purge all my meals so that I don't gain weight because I have gained a lot of weight during quarantine from binge eating all the time. But in the end, purging is not worth it. It can make you feel better after you eat too much, but at what cost? You might lose weight but it can cause serious problems for your body. 
Also, when you talk to someone about this, no one is going to ask you how many calories you ate. If they do ask about what you consumed, they will only ask what quantities and how frequently you did it. Its not about how many calories you ate because you can purge when you eat 100 calories. If you are worried that someone will ask you about your calorie intake, you can let them know that you're not comfortable sharing that info. If you ask someone for help, like a therapist, they won't judge you at all. 
Anyway, I hope things can get easier for you. Please try your best to not develop bulimia.

Maybe you are still not allowing all foods, which is restriction, so you still have urges to binge on those foods.

Expect to still binge for awhile after that, and expect to have poor digestion and maybe gain some weight. Bit I promise you those binges will get less and less and fewer and farther between. Your body is still asking for calories because it needs them along with nutrients. Eventually.your weight will plateau for a time, then decrease to your set point. 

See Stephanie Buttermore's all in journey on YouTube she explains a lot of this. 

I'm skinnier now compared to when I had my ED and I eat what I want , when I want. Give into your fear foods and eventually they will lose power over you and you'll be able to eat them moderation.

 I had to go through the extreme hunger period...lasted a few months of binging. 
The absolute key is to stop purging. No vomitting or excercise purging. Throw the scale away because the weight you are or will be for awhile isn't your actual set point...so what's the point in obsessing over something that's temporary. 
LISTEN TO YOUR BODY. If you're hungry eat!!

In my opinion therapists and doctors can sometimes be unhelpful, they may give you a calorie limit or food plan that will be too low on calories for what you need right now. 
Obviously go to a doctor to get your health checked out, but my doctor didn't understand me eating 5000 calories a day during my extreme hunger. They will try and promote restriction.

Hello, 

I am a nursing student who was displaced from clinical due to COVID-19. I have been 

approved by the Board of registered nursing to discuss health-related issues with the online 

community. I have found the following information relating to Bulimia nervosa and I would like to help and support you. I understand your frustration and I am sure it can get difficult at times and I am sorry you feel that way. If you have any questions about lifestyle changes, coping with those lifestyle changes, diet changes, medications, etc please post here and I will answer them throughout the day. I am working under the supervision of our instructor, however, the 

education we give is not to replace that of your primary care provider. According to national library of medicine, Therapists may not always address the root of the problem, but speaking about it can help relieve physical distress. Also, alternative ways can involve exercising, yoga, relaxation as well as support group and cognitive behavioral therapy, which changes negative irrational thoughts to positive rational thoughts. The following link talks about the disorder its self and ways you can get treatments: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5792652/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5792652/)

I am not a medical doctors, please follow the advice of your Primary Care Physician. We can 

answer questions, but our information does not replace what your Primary Care Physician has 

stated.

&gt;The association is strongly reinforced in people with coexisting  personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder which is  characterized by extreme, impulsive behavioral patterns to put it very  mildly.

Impulsivity, emotional instability, risk taking and self harm are all characteristic of BPD, and among people with bulimia, about 20% have comorbid BPD. About 40% of people with BPD have an ED over their lifetime, with bulimia being more common than AN or BED, for example. Fortunately BPD is treated relatively effectively with targeted treatment like [dialectical behavior therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy), which is also applied to bulimia. Many people with ""complex problems"" (multiple diagnoses) start to see improvement when adding DBT to treat borderline symptoms directly.

And yes I DEFINITELY think not restricting helps with urge to binge, I know from experience (and if you read the book, it’s backed by science:).

In regards to the “one week”, honestly just find a time frame you feel comfortable with for the trial window, and try your best to stick to that. But be forgiving with yourself too. Eating disorders are usually a coping mechanism and it makes sense that it’s hard to turn away from when it has given you a sense of control and comfort so much.

Also I just wanna add, it’s really hard to not want to restrict. It’s also hard to not want to binge. It really helps to eat slow and regularly!! and be kind to yourself. If you slip up, it is okay! It’s normal. Especially with the “recovery bloat”, it was really hard for me.

Here is what I focused on... I STOPED THINKING ABOUT IT... i just STOPED... And for numerous times when i tried i failed but thats because I was still thinking about it... Oh I ate this and this and that is that many calories NO... When you eat try focusing on when you feal the right amount of full... Try with 3 meals a day that include as many vegetables and meat possible... Dont overeat is what i'm saying.. 2. i STOPED talking with my family and friends about it because when i talked about it i was puting my mind in that place you know... And we don't want that we want to forget about this horible disease and focus on things that make us happy...go out... Take a walk...do things that make u happy...

Exercise for 15 minutes a day just so you can fell Better you know it gives you a feelings like you doing something good for your body (which you are) or you can strech... The main thing is that you must not think about it to hard... Let things Flow... And listen to me: usually i gain weight Pretty easily...i didn't even restricted myself from mcdonalds.. I didn't gained a pound... FOR 9 WEEKS...trust me please... It is all in our head that is why it is so hard... You must stay positive... You should focus on yourself now and noone else...

First I didn’t care about it but when I got older, my friends started to get noticed by boys and went on dates. I was already insecure then. Noone ever cared for me so I decided to shed some weight. I did it healthy and was happy. 

Fast forward to last year. I planned to get married this November. I decided to get a bit more in shape, went to the gym and ate healthy. I felt very good. When Covid came, I was scared to gain weight because the gym was closed. I just started to eat very little, and didn’t felt bad about it. I actually lost more and started to like it, it was in a weird way challenging. Can I get to xx lbs? My fiancé noticed and was worried, which made me feel guiltily proud but also sad because I never wanted him to be preoccupied. 

Later that year, we took the decision to postpone the wedding to next year. I was devastated for obvious reasons, but even more because I didn’t think I could keep this weight off for another year. 
So, out of sadness, I did a full 180. I felt sorry for myself and literally thought f*ck it, all the hard work for nothing, I started to buy cookies, crisps, nuts, cakes, pastries etc. in secret and washed them down with loads chocolatemilk. It felt good at first but afterwards I was frightened by all the calories. So I started to puke and was surprised how easy it was. I do this whole cycle now since over 2 months 3-5 times a day. 

I live with my fiancé, his sister and his parents in a small house and can’t wait to get out (they’re really nice and heartwarming thouh and I feel so ungrateful) I’m not used to that as we are from very different cultures I l live in his country now. However there’s no privacy or quiet time, that’s also a huge trigger to me. I feel like screaming and kicking the pillows, but I don’t want to find any excuses. It’s a problem I have and I know I need to find a solution for it.

I hate myself for buying every pastry that looks tasty to me at the bakery while a poor girl asks the vending lady which is the cheapest piece to see if she can afford it. I catch myself thinking: If I would be as skinny as her, I’d be happy. The truth is that this poor girl, like many others here doesn’t have enough to eat and my privileged ass spends loads of money on all kinds of food just to purge it out immeriately.

Every day I feel so guilty and tell myself: Today it will have been the last time, but it never is.

In 7th grade when I was 13, I was in Texas visiting my grandparents for thanksgiving. My parents, sister, grandma and I went to the store to pick up this new dishwasher that my parents bought for my grandparents. When my grandma, sister and I were waiting in the car, my grandma starts going on (in Spanish) how ‘fat’ I am and all that even though I was at a healthy weight. I’m not sure why but that really bothered me, like I’ve never really bothered about my weight before. I started purging food, and working out more. I remember joining cross country and track in junior high to help me lose weight and continued it in high school. But while doing that I didn’t lose much weight but I did end up loving running. I remember in junior high I’d jog in place at night in my room when I was supposed to be sleeping.

Ten years later, it’s my first year of grad school getting my Master’s degree and I’m still dealing with bulimia. I’m still at ‘normal’ weight for my height. This past December-February I relapsed and lost some weight, but still in the ‘normal’ range. Being really really short I guess it was a noticeable amount even though it wasn’t a lot cuz my parents said stuff and even one of my professors made some snide story during class to indirect me. 

I can’t speak for the rest of the Latino community, but with my family/extended family it’s harder to have anorexia because my family expects to eat, and my dad especially expects us to finish our plate. I think this is partly why I developed bulimia instead. My dad’s not like this much anymore but he’ll say something to my younger brother here and there and wants him to gain weight.  I don’t really binge but I do over exercise and purge especially when my parents make a big meal or when they unexpectedly buy fast food/pizza for lunch or dinner.

I also always had an association (from the media and my mother) that females should be on diets and fat = bad.

I started gaining at about 18. Went to university, had a new sense of freedom, and started eating all the foods I wasn't allowed at home. I felt so lonely at uni and food was a comfort. I hated myself. I purged a few times. Uni for me was full of comfort eating.

Then I met my now ex about 6 years ago. His mum was a recovering anorexic and sister was bulimic. I lived with them and felt extreme pressure to diet - about 600 calories a day with 1 hour exercise. So I lost a lot of weight and became my thinnest. 

Over the next few years I was very restrictive with food, went through stages of purging and binged every few weeks. My weight remained pretty low. I exercised daily. Constantly felt fat.

I broke up with him about a year ago and suddenly felt free of his family and their pressure for thinness. I started eating, and couldnt stop, so for the past year I've gained about 2 stone. My binges have been out of control. I would say I'm embarrassed to leave the house. I'm a UK size 10-12 so it's the biggest I've been since uni. 

I currently b/p about once a week.

A lot of slim people are eating 2000+ calories a day, and stay slim because they are consistent and don't feel the need to over eat.

- try and shift your focus from your diet. Find hobbies and things to occupy your brain. The brain has to think about something, so it's easy to obsess over weight and trying to control something. My ED has flared up over lockdown because I haven't had any distractions. Think of your goals in life and concentrate on working towards the ones that don't involve weight loss

- understand that the urge to binge is just a fleeting thing, and you can just dismiss it. The book Brain over binge explains this wonderfully. Every time you get a binge urge, use it as practice - see it as a good thing. It's an opportunity to practice dismissing the urge.

- exercise. This will make you feel good about yourself, shape a body you're proud of, improve your health, get that endorphin high, and of course manage your weight. A lot of people have accredited resistance training to helping them get over restrictive diets.

- understand that it's OK to be someone who cares about their weight, but you need to put boundaries in place to not become obsessive. E.g. don't weigh yourself if that's something you obsess over",,1602258007,{},g884pgi,False,t3_j7j0ba,False,True,t3_j7j0ba,/r/bulimia/comments/j7j0ba/didnt_binge_for_3_weeks_but_still_feel_lost/g884pgi/,1602258528,1,True,False,bulimia,t5_2tmc8,0,[],,,,,

Tooth damage can be avoided or at least minimized with baking soda or aluminum-free antacid before a purge. (And if one knows that one IS going to purge anyway, it's best to at least minimize what damage *is* preventable.)

Using a mild nauseant/emetive/emetic like salty water has reduced the heart backlash for me. Makes the purging easier too since nausea range is already reached.

I avoid Lite Salt personally since the iodide makes me really sick, so instead I make my own mixes using pure, additive free sodium chloride\* and potassium chloride. (Which can be respectively bought as canning/pickling salt, and a brand called NuSalt.)

The best solution is of course to not binge--&gt;purge in the first place, but not everyone is a God, and sometimes it really do be too late and yeah vomiting can make me feel better if, say, I ate an entire week's worth of food supplies within a single hour.

Massive overload of food can do a lot of harm as well.

I’m 29 now and I started having palpitations and irregular heartbeat at 19, but it was written off as anxiety because I didn’t want to come clean about my purging. It has come and gone over the years but recently it’s been really bad. I’ve woken up several nights thinking I’m having a heart attack. I get hard palpitations just sitting on the couch, randomly. I’ve had extensive tests done this year to look for clogged arteries or any physical defects on my heart and there were none. 

Anyway my point to my rambling is, it will never be truly safe, I’m worried I’ve damaged my body to the point of no return but I still go back to it. The sooner you can get into recovery the better.

This is slightly unrelated but there is new advice on how we should compliment young girls. For example, you're less likely to compliment a young boy's outfit/hair as soon as you see them, so why say it to a girl? You should compliment what they have achieved and what they like and only compliment their clothes if they bring it up or later on because it stresses that what they look like isn't the most important thing about them; their actions and achievements are.

I’m sorry we live with such society standards that bring us down. You &amp; I are two completely different people who have experienced body shaming in two completely different ways. Yet both are still considered body shaming &amp; are detrimental no matter who we are or what kind of life we live.
We don’t know eachother but I can reassure you right now that you don’t need to lose weight as to uphold a certain straight man image. You should want to “get into shape” for yourself &amp; your own mental/physical health, if that’s what you want. I say “get into shape” because saying “lose weight” is triggering I think. But you shouldn’t do it or feel the need to do it because it’s what you’re expected to do from trash people around you.
I’m also sorry that girls have not expressed romantic interest. It might be where you live tbh lol you live in the sticks. There’s a sticks area out of town where I live &amp; the people are a bit weird there lol so I feel like it makes sense.

I don’t speak for the entire queer community but I think a lot of queer people (especially gay men) have it in mind that absolutely everyone should already know everything about their lives &amp; shouldn’t be asking questions hahah the idea that the world revolves us. I’ve had a lot of negative interactions with queer people when I ask about their sexual &amp; gender identities (&amp; I’m literally apart of this community 🤦🏼‍♂️)
But there’s also a large number of queer people who are always open &amp; willing to share things, as to help others try to understand. 

It does sound like a slur doesn’t it? Tbh I think a lot of roles in any relationship is a bit weird. Like if you’re a masculine straight man who loves to work &amp; wants to take care of your girl then you should definitely live in that role. But, if you’re not that type of guy but you’re dating a girl who tells you you need to be the bread winner &amp; take care of her, then that’s weird. Some straight guys want to be taken care of, which I think is completely okay because some women want to be the bread winner &amp; take care of their man lol. 
I think it’s just a matter of finding someone you fit well with, apart from your physical attraction to them. Same in the gay community. Masculine gay guys are always expected to be muscular, hairy, &amp; dominant. Feminine gay guys are suppose to be dainty &amp; subservient.

Also, I don’t think you’re dumb. You asked a question you genuinely wanted to know the answer to. Some people are intense homophones who sarcastically ask &amp; then mock the answer lol. Those are the dumb people. You are not one.

I developed anorexia september 2019 and restricted heavily for about a year. i decided in november of 2020 to recover finally. i’d been in quasi recovery for the past couple months before that. in my recovery journey, i decided to go all in. by that, i mean i eat anything i want whenever i want without maximums but the minimum was 3000 calories. i ended up gaining 20 pounds so far. it has been hard. my jeans no longer fit. my face and stomach are bloated. but i lost my period, i lost my fair, i lost my confidence..all from my ed. i also lost friendships, my life, family relationships because of my ed. i feel like, in this past year, i’ve missed out on so much bc i’d been so hyper focused on food. and i still am, which sucks. i went from obsessing over calories to obsessing over when I’m going to eat next and constantly going back to the kitchen for more food and snacks. weirdly, it’s chocolate that i always binge on. (which before my ed, i never really was too fond of) it’s an everyday struggle that i want to relapse and have to fight it. what has helped me is thinking of everything my ed has taken away from me. and everything i want back. it’s important to not get too bent out on the weight gain. you’re gaining weight bc you need to. your body is begging for any sort of fat. just yesterday my mom told me she thought my face was sunken in (during my prime ed) and that really shocked me. i didn’t think i looked ‘that bad’. that just shows how messed up all of our body images are of ourselves. we all look at other people and congratulate them on being confident on how they look and yet we will never accept ourselves for who we are. and that’s horrible. 

another thing that has helped me with recovery is knowing there are only two paths on this journey. one is recovering and healing yourself. the other is death. eating disorders are the most common mental illness to end in death. i myself have had suicidal thoughts bc of this disorder. which is sick to think about, that id rather die than eat ice cream or a pasta dish. ultimately who cares what your weight is. who cares if your body is cushy? only yourself. anyone else that says a comment about your weight negatively, does not deserve to be in your life. cut all of the background noise out and focus on healing your body and your mentality.

I’ve had a legitimate weight issue (BMI overweight) for about 2 years and trying to lose the weight has been difficult. I’m about 180 at 5’8” as a female. I have some other health issues (2 autoimmune disorders, POTS, PCOS, fibromyalgia) that make it necessary for me to maintain a healthy weight while also making it difficult to exercise. And supposedly weight is lost in the kitchen, and I’m good at crazy restriction so this should be NBD right? 

Wrong. Even maintaining 1200 calories/day, I can’t lose weight. I went so far as to cut out soda completely, replace it with water only—no juice, diet soda, sweetened coffee or tea drinks. Being hungry all the time and not enjoying anything I eat, I can still only lose about ~3 pounds. I’ve talked to my GP about this and, while he recommends me being more active, he seems to think that each person ‘settles’ at their body’s ‘ideal’ weight. That number is directed purely by the body, and there’s not much we can do about it. He also keeps telling me about this research that basically says we all eat backwards—breakfast should be the biggest meal of the day, lunch should be slightly smaller, and dinner should be really light. 


Except I am not a morning person, can’t eat much more than a granola bar without feeling sick for 2-3 hours after waking up. If I don’t eat my ‘normal’ meal at dinner time, I will go to bed with my stomach growling and not sleep...and you know what they say about the importance of restful sleep and weight loss. 🙄

I just finished a really intense nursing program, and couldn’t afford much non-study time other than the bare minimum for adulting (grocery shopping, cleaning the house, etc).

So, Covid-19 hit, I rush back to my home country with one of the last minute flights, the borders are closing, the world is closing. I still thank the universe for this, I managed to return to my parents’ place to spend the lockdown. First time for the last 6 years, we were to live together as a family again. I felt complete, I felt in peace and happy for the first time after a long time. Moving to a new country was much harder than I thought, my bulimia had gotten worse, I went into a depression and so on. I finally felt like I can start to recover with my family while I stayed with them, as the umiversity turned lectures online.

I thought I was happy, and I decided to change the way things are, starting with my eating disorder. I knew I had tried this many times and failed in each, so I decided to take a different approach. So I thought, it is hard for me to keep things in when I eat even a normal amount, which feels like a lot. So if I eat less, I can prevent this loop. Any sane person can see the biased logic in this point of view. I couldn’t, it just seemed like a good idea. So I stopped eating, and simultaneously, binging and purging. I am healed, I haven’t vomited in the last two months, I’ve beaten the disorder now, right??! I really thought I did, the only thing I couldn’t see was, all I was doing was to give it another form. I started losing weight. Quickly. I was not vomiting, so everything seemed fine, but I didn’t realize I was eating barely anything now, with the fear of seeing my disease coming back to surface. I didn’t realize it, but my family did. They started complaining I was not eating anything and I lost a lot of weight (to my delight). They tried to feed me, they even said I was not pretty anymore and looked like a skinny child. It was right, I could see my body, I could see my womanly features diminishing slowly.

My older sister has had anorexia for many years, since I was 13 and I'm almost 23. I recently visited my home where she is staying with my parents as she works on her health. For context I stayed with her during University while she was very unwell, we lived together in a flat. 

I sat down with her when I went home and she expressed how much guilt she feels re the impact of her illness, as she has many times over the years.

I told her honestly that when I see her I don't see her illness. I don't think about the times I saw her in hospital, or in severe distress.

I see my childhood companion, my ride or die, the person I have loved dearly and looked up to for her courage, for the way she has never given up even when it has been unbearable. Yes, she has displayed disordered behaviours, but I would likely have picked them up from my very weight-conscious peers. Anorexia is also heavily featured in my genetics.

My sister has modelled strength through adversity. Life will throw more than just food and weight concerns at your loved ones. Please try to have compassion for yourself - we all do our best with what we have.

From a little sister, it's ok to to let go of this guilt - it fuels the disorder.

It hasn't cured me, but learning about your disorder is a step towards your recovery. Obviously seeing a therapist would be the best approach.

I can't fight all binge urges but I'm getting better at it. Here are my tips 

- Have a reason to get healthy. My binging has gotten worse during the pandemic because I can't go anywhere and it makes me depressed. When I went through a break up, my binging got worse. It's a way to deal with negative emotions. But now I try and remember binging causes negative emotions. I feel *awful* after a binge. So to avoid those negative emotions, I have to avoid the binge. Positive reinforcement. Think how light and healthy you feel when you haven't binged in a few days. You want to keep that feeling! A big turning point for me was when I started telling myself how *awful* binging made me feel, as opposed to how comforting food was. Rewire your brain to hate binging. I used to crave it. Now I dread it.

- Delay. Tell yourself you can binge in 10 minutes. The binge urge will always go. Brush your teeth, listen to music, have a shower, go for a walk.

- if you restrict, you will binge. If you use laxatives or purge, you will tell your body it needs more food and it will give you binge urges. Read about ghrelin. An average female needs 2000 calories a day. For ages I was wondering why I couldn't stop binging even though I was eating 1800 cals. It just wasn't enough. Eat the food!! Digest your next binge without laxatives, to end the cycle. Eat every few hours. Eat nutritious and filling foods.

- have a routine. Write a list on your phone of your day plan. When I'm aimlessly bored, my brain turns to food. Keep busy. Try and find things you enjoy in your daily routine and make every day as happy as possible.

- plan volume meals that feel like a binge. I've got some go-to meals that are nutritious, tasty and massive.

I feel similar with the 'it must be better than trying to get rid of it all, right?'. I know purging is bad for your health and it doesn't remove the guilt/hatred/negativity from the binge for me - it's too late I already did it. Usually I just endeavour to restrict more to compensate, which obviously isn't the solution. But sometimes that over full feeling is too uncomfortable and I need that instant relief.   
I'm guessing we both know we need to rethink these behaviours, try be kinder to ourselves etc. etc. But it's hard when it feels invalidating to not be the 'perfect ED sufferer' and even harder to shift your mindset to actually wanting to be a healthy, happy person.

First, you have nothing to be ashamed of. Thank you for coming here and reaching out, and thank you for taking the first step to reconfiguring how you’ll take care of yourself. This is good. 

You’re struggling and that’s okay. Everything you feel is valid, and you’re going to come through this. 

It’s trial and error. You deserve to take care of yourself, you deserve to start with a basic need. This is a big task for you, so don’t think about anything like “I should have done this sooner” because that’s not the point. The point is, you’re going to do it. And you’re going to feel all sorts of things. 

Discomfort isn’t abnormal when you’re pushing the boundaries of what you’ve become accustomed to. That isn’t you, but your illness trying to keep you in. When you listen to it, it wins. When you appease the anxiety and panic it makes you feel, it’s winning. That isn’t you choosing to be lazy or dirty or whatever you may think, it’s you finding comfort in the chaos bulimia has thrust unto you. 

So this is a big step. You may or may not find relief when it is over, but you and your body deserve this. 

Perhaps out loud, verbally fight what you are feeling. Focus on the basic steps of this cleaning ritual, and guide yourself out loud. 

Prepare it so you have a set of clean clothes and towels to step out and in to, the feeling of something clean alone can help. 

“I am starting the shower. I think I like this temperature.”

“Now, I have to remove the used clothing.” 

“I’m going to wash the past weeks away.”

“I am safe. I am taking care of myself. I may not feel great, but this is the beginning to something better. This is a good start.”

Maybe if you can manage it, a clean set of sheets on your bed too. Fresh can really help your mindset. 

Perhaps you find yourself comparing your life to others in anyway, maybe even who you were able to be before. This won’t help you. What may, is what I call, flipping or spinning it. No one has a life that is linear and no one is you, so your journey is valid and your struggles are too. No matter how you feel about what you’re experiencing, you deserve to get better.

If all that is too much, start with micro-goals.  Celebrate yourself whenever you can and understand that doesn’t mean your progress stops. It helps you love yourself a bit more every day, and allows you to live alongside you. 

So maybe all you can do today is step into the bathroom and place a clean towel. Or even step in, stand for a minute, whatever it may be. Any small advance towards you getting to your goal, which is to shower, is still an advance. So focus on that. 

Talking to yourself is helpful. Things like, 
“I may not have gotten to the main goal. But today I set up my towel and clothes I want to wear for when I do finish, and that is still progression. That is still going forward. I am doing well.”

Where is the harm in fighting back against the voices in your head that are mean? You may not be where you want to be and I want to remind you that is very okay. It’s those little slow steps forward that will make your happiness and progression more long term. 

The more micro goals you achieve, the more you’ll find yourself desiring to achieve more of them. It’s cool. You may find yourself thinking “well dang, I put the towel in here. I think I could probably brush my teeth even too. That’s not a lot.” And then boom, two things done. Broken into bite sizes. 

I do this, every day. I also struggle with showering. I have managed to go to once a week and I walk myself through it because even though it’s uncomfortable, discomfort is part of the recovery. It’s the growing pains and it’s ALWAYS okay to step back if you can’t manage your level of stress.

Try to just listen to them and just notice what they are specifically. Maybe write them down. Next day try to have the shower door/curtain open. Put your hand in if you feel comfortable. Feel the rain on it. Notice the warmth of it on your skin. Again, notice your thoughts. If it feels like you start going too fast, then take a step back and just listen to the water. 

Remember that this can be a long process, so have patience with yourself. This isn't something that can or SHOULD be solved in a day, heck even a week. Give yourself time. Praise yourself and treat yourself for even taking a small step forward. Give yourself understanding and patience for needing to take a step back.

Did you ever have refeeding syndrome with a/n? Don't know your history but that was my first thought from your symptoms, especially the palpitations after eating. I don't know much about it personally but I've heard it sometimes requires an IV to replenish electrolytes, which would explain why gatorade isn't enough. Maybe try bumping up to Pedialyte if you can find it?
 
Rolaids (the antacid) are another cheap source of calcium + magnesium, and most grocery stores carry salt substitutes that are basically potassium chloride. No Salt is the brand I use. Both of those help me with electrolyte imbalances.
 
Actually, Rolaids are a good idea in general if you b/p. Bulimia gives me chronic heartburn/dyspepsia that feels like a lot of what you described: sharp chest pain, wheezing and shortness of breath, especially right after meals (and if I try to lie down after eating it's super super noticeable). That wouldn't explain the palpitations, but it may help in the future.

Every word I write here is the absolute truth. Your current emotions and thoughts were mine once. I’ll tell you a little about my lows. I drank every night and it alienated friends and men I was interested in. Feeling that shame and rejection made me drink more so I couldn’t feel it. The cycle was exhausting.  Additionally, there were so many times where I didn’t necessarily want to die. I just didn’t want to exist. I took so much of a prescribed anti-depressant that I had seizures and I was hallucinating. I’ve been involuntarily committed to psych ward. I’ve cut myself. And on top of all of this I was an active bulimic. You said you feel so alone. I remember being at parties and crowded bars. I may have looked fine but truthfully I felt like there was an invisible box around me. I was totally alone.
I found a wonderful therapist and I told her all of this. She accepted what I told her and worked with me and a psychiatrist to tackle this.  I won’t lie— it took a looong time to find a therapist, the right medication and going to AA meetings and finding an AA (woman) sponsor to help. It’s tough... you might have to shop around and find people you trust. It was two steps forward, one step back and it didn’t happen overnight. Issues of our magnitude needs to be tackled from all corners.
It’s easy for me to say all of this now but when I first spoke to women with a similar history ( like me talking to you) I couldn’t believe they overcame it. I swear I thought they were bullshitting me. They weren’t. 
It’s like looking at art in a museum. If you are looking at with your nose an inch away from it, it’s hard to see what the painting is. But as you take one step back you see it better. Take many steps back and you see the whole painting... when I was immersed in my pain I couldn’t understand it. But as time passed I saw myself better, I saw my problems and saw who I was.
This might not make any sense to you. But if I can tell you one thing— don’t get comfortable with your misery. Don’t give up on yourself. You have a difficult journey ahead of you but with some patience, you can make a team that’ll have your back and you will be stronger and wiser (even if you don’t know it yet). I love, love, love you. Your disease is telling you that you are alone. It’s lying to you. But I’m telling you the truth. You can get through this. And maybe one day you’ll be sharing your story of recovery with a scared girl just like what I’m doing right now. ♥️",,1614029340,{},godx2fu,False,t3_lpajiv,False,True,t3_lpajiv,/r/bulimia/comments/lpajiv/ranting/godx2fu/,1614033954,3,True,False,bulimia,t5_2tmc8,1,[],,,,,

Remember, acid will damage your teeth, and will take effect once contact is made, but you can minimize damage by rinsing with an alkaline solution (baking soda with water helps). Don’t brush your teeth right away, because right after is when your teeth are freshly exposed and enamel can be brushed off. Just do a rinse. You should be fine to brush after 30 mins, and do please floss to remove anything between your teeth (it’s better to floss before brushing) 

As far as a time frame, damage is cumulative. Any amount of acid exposure, even once, will do some damage. Because of how unique everyone’s bodies are, there is no way to give you a concrete answer on how soon you will damage your teeth to the point of causing problems. I would expect significant issues if you’ve been purging for 1.5 yrs though 

Signs are any brittleness, sensitivity, cracks, discoloration (often more grey; yellow is more likely attributed to superficial staining, which soft enamel can be more prone to - do you drink coffee?), pain, erosion of the gum line, gum inflammation, indentations on the biting surface of your teeth. Usually, you won’t be able to feel a cavity until it’s gone deep enough to reach the nerve of your tooth where it causes pain.

Bulimia nervosa is diagnosed when a number of criteria are met, namely that the sufferer shows the following behaviors and characteristics:
-Engages in binge eating on a recurrent basis via episodes characterized by eating more food in one sitting than most other people would. The sufferer also experiences a lack of control over how much food they eat, or feels unable to stop eating.
-Recurrently takes inappropriate steps to prevent weight gain, such as by vomiting, fasting, excessively exercising or misusing laxatives and/or diuretics.
-Experiences episodes of binge eating and compensatory purging behaviors at least once a week for three months or more.
-Pre occupied with body shape and weight in self evaluation.

Between one and three episodes per week is classed as mild bulimia; four to seven weekly episodes is moderate. Severe bulimia is specified if the sufferer records between eight and 13 episodes each week and 14 or more episodes over a seven-day period constitutes extreme bulimia (American Psychiatric Association 2013).",,1594864610,{},fy7kxr2,False,t3_hryzi4,False,True,t3_hryzi4,/r/bulimia/comments/hryzi4/i_dont_know/fy7kxr2/,1594879210,2,True,False,bulimia,t5_2tmc8,0,[],,,,,

For things like these, it went away for me and I'm certain that in time you'll overcome it too. But for purging i don't think it ever will cause its not something natural to begin with

It's still early, give it some time. It gets better, trust me. You will stop focusing on it in the end. I used to measure my pulse all day long, I was checking my fitbit every 5 minutes, I even bought a finger pulse oximeter and would sometimes leave it on for 30+ minutes just to be reassured that my heart isn't racing.

But when I was purging on a daily basis my heart rate wasn't going up. Since the ""on and off"" bulimia started, I think my body recovered from it and now even when I unintentionally vomit eg from a car ride, it goes up and I start panicking too.

I was scared of binging in the beginning.. but all the stress in my life made me get out of control again. Yesterday I had a bad day too, but from binging. I felt like I couldn't breathe and the uncomfortable feeling made my chest feel tight (probably also because of reflux) and I was panicking.

You need to drink something with some electrolytes. I recommend Pedialyte, Or Gatorade I believe low calorie options are available in both of these.

What I do is actually put Himalayan pink salt and potassium in water and just drink that,  It's more of a fasting technique and its for tough people. So if that's not your cup of tea, gab you some Pedialyte and you should be feeling better in no time.

I understand the denial or the ""just for now"" mentality. It's part of the addiction. Just like when you tell yourself ""this is the last binge."" it's a lie. You will binge again and it effing sucks to the core. But the small silver lining is with each episode you are given a chance to assess your triggers and practice delaying the binge.
It takes time. I'm a year into recovery and I still have a lot to learn. I know I'll binge again. This is where being gentle on yourself and understanding that this is a mental illness is critical. Maybe you binged all day, but did you shower and go outside for a half minute walk? Did you delay a binge by 20 seconds? That's a win!
If you get a chance, I strongly suggest looking up intuitive eating. It is used in multiple places in the states for ED recovery and is science based. It's not easy to accept but nothing about recovering from any mental illness is. It takes work. You know what though? You are worth it.
You, and your body, are worth love. Keep picking yourself up and with (lots and lots) time you'll realize as much as I do how resilient you are. You are not your binges. You just go through them.

Through my journey (still going on) as I would try and get healthy and stop one maladaptive coping behavior (like restricting food), my mind would immediately pick up a new way of trying to cope. 

I began with anorexia, then cutting, then eating and purging without binging, hair pulling, chewing and spitting out, skin and hair picking until I bled, drugs and alcohol. I don’t mean this to be like it was a straight line, all these bad coping systems mixed together and at times I focused on one more than the other, you know how it goes. Whatever you need to do to make it through where you’re at and the day.

Your mind is familiar with these ways of controlling your anxiety and bad feelings, and knows these are the behaviors that work to bring order, control and good chemicals like dopamine and serotonin into your brain. 

1) talk about all of this with your counselor, all therapy hurts like shit and makes you feel worse before you feel better. It’s a normal part of healing and switching behaviors and doing “new” behaviors is all very normal.

2) try to think about, not do, but just think about, what activities you might enjoy doing that will be a good coping mechanism and that also releases “feel-good” chemicals into your body. For me it was running, art, petting my cat. Later, with the support of your counselor, you can begin to make moves to replace those coping mechanisms that hurt your body and mind, with ones that help AND feel good. 

No one can expect you to build a house while taking all of your tools away. First you need to 1) begin to think you might just be worth being taken care of, and worth being healthy, 2)realize your current tools are broken and they are hurting you when you use them, 3)try to let those old tools go and put those tools in the garbage, 4)think about finding new, better tools, 5)save up for them, 6)buy one at a time (get buyers regret, take it back to the store, take your old broken tools out of the trash, find some other broken tools that you saw in a garbage dump and try those tools out, realize those broken tools suck also, put them back, buy your new tools again, rinse, repeat, 7)start building your forever home with the best tools on the market.

unlike other mental illnesses, bulimia is much more quantitative in the sense that it's [split into four categories dependant on frequency, as seen in the DSM 5 criteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4361239/). Because of this, self-diagnosis is distinctly different from, say, depression, since it's a lot more black and white. (kind of 'if you do it, you have it')

at the same time, i don't encourage self-diagnosis at all because what you consider to be an 'episode' may not match the same standards of someone else/ a professional. regardless, i don't want to let a label invalidate your experience. you're struggling, and that much is clear. however, if having a diagnosis and fully knowing that the label applies to you would help you deal with it, i'd suggest seeing a psychiatrist.

You can also tell them you’re a recovered bulimic even if it’s a lie, but makes it’s a little less spooky to share.) 

Anyway, all this to say, my doctor prescribed me a toothpaste that has 100% fixed my tooth sensitivity. Even if you don’t have symptoms in your teeth I think it would be protective. It was cheap too, thought I guess that’s insurance-related, but I think I paid less than $10 for it and it’s super worth it! 

Beyond that, I hate to offer advice that encourages purging, but I know it’s more complicated than that (obviously I hope you can recover and everything will be sunshine and happy) but after purging, rinse with water. Don’t brush your teeth right after especially with any harsh/whitening toothpaste. Dental hygiene is still key so definitely still brush, just not right after purging. Also, floss. Minimum once a day. I never knew but like flossing is the number one aid against cavities because all my cavities are on the sides of my teeth which I didn’t know was a thing. Floss after a purge and rinse with water.

I probably could’ve been more brief with this comment but I don’t have the energy to recompose, hopefully you can get through it lol.

I could feel the anxiety building up, I just wanted to eat, eat, eat..Every time something was going wrong at work (usually bullying) I was binging from the moment I was done, all the way home, and I kept going on and on.. Most of the time I wasn't even hungry. So then I started calling my mom every day after work. I would just tell her everything that was bothering me and hearing about her day and her struggles was shifting my focus from my stress to other things. She would make me laugh and the stress wasn't as overwhelming as before. Just call someone and wait it out.


I don't suggest you start smoking, it's very very unhealthy, but when I'd feel overwhelmed and I would feel like I want to binge, I would go smoke. 5 minutes break from reality. I'd just enjoy that and re-evaluate the situation.


Never watch mukbangs. When I would watch ppl consume all this delicious food I'd just feel so sorry about myself. *Why can't I eat too all this junk???* And then I'd go like ""Fuck this, I can, and I will""


leave the house and don't take money with you. Going on long walks would calm me down. I would ask myself ""Why do I want to do it? If I'm already hurting, why should I hurt myself more?"".


Otherwise, I would vomit all my feelings away and a weight was lifted off my shoulders. Listen, you have to actively recognize when it begins and stop it right then and there. It's hard in the beginning, it takes a lot of effort. I deleted all the food delivery apps like ubereats from my phone and stopped buying binge food altogether. 


I started getting only actual groceries online. I had a ""favorites"" list and would only order from there. No browsing other things cause it was so easy to give in. I was avoiding going to the store. The doughnut section was my weakness. And the moment I had 1 doughnut in my cart...that was it..game over, I would just surrender and buy a shit ton of junk to comfort myself. I would regret it on the way home but I didn't want to ""waste it"". And btw that's all bs that your ED will try to tell you. throwing it up in the toilet is even worse than leaving the binge food, even on the street if you have to..at least someone in need will enjoy it.


I had slip ups but it is SO worth it. Now when I'm stressed out I just lay down.. close my eyes.. think of solutions to the problem. No solutions? It's okay, I'll watch kitty videos.

Look at what emotions come up for you when it triggers a binge then write it out. It helps to get it out and deal with it. Kristin Neff has a rain meditation that would be good in these situations. I would check it out. You are allowed to feel your emotions! Eating disorders are coping mechanisms so recovering is learning to change those learned behaviors into healthy coping mechanisms.

So while it feels hard to turn down a dinner with friends and puts you down, you’re doing the right thing! Pushing away triggers can be isolating though, and that can be counter productive on recovery so two tips for you:

1. tell one person in your group of friends about your bulimia. Have an ally in the group. Someone you trust can keep a secret but also can help influence the group choosing a restaurant that’s not buffet, and be the one who says “let’s try something else this time guys” instead of you...and suggest gatherings not be around food but an activity like bowling. 

2. Read the first few chapters of The Bulimia Help Method the night your friends are at the buffet. Im a 10yr long bulimic in strong recovery, all thanks to this book. you can have it for free on amazon kindle as your first download). It’s life changing.

I'm super proud of the fact that I talked to a professional about it. I've made so many changes this year! You're right, looking at how much good I've done is important. Makes me feel so proud!

[],,ItsElectraBitch,,,[],,,,text,t2_696kohku,False,False,[],"Hi there. So sorry to hear this is happening, it’s a good thing that she has been honest with you about what she did, though I personally do not think our mental illness should be taken as an excuse. 
I am a doctor (Internal Medicine), but from my general Psychiatry studies there tends to be an association of bulimia to struggles with impulse control. Bulimia nervosa is intrinsically an impulsive disease where an inability to control ourselves around food -using it compulsively as an emotional support- leads us to try and achieve some level of control via purging. 

This tendency towards impulsivity can trickle down to our social, financial and overall life decisions. The association is strongly reinforced in people with coexisting personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder which is characterized by extreme, impulsive behavioral patterns to put it very mildly. 

I can tell from personal experience struggling with bulimia that I do tend to be impulsive in other aspects of my life as well, and that I have had experiences where I have wanted something -or someone- and I have gotten it. Regardless of the consequences of my actions. Later, when guilt shows up, we try to excuse ourselves -to undo our actions- just like we do when we purge. 

It is present in different degrees of severity but yes, impulsivity might make us more prone to bad decisions, but they are decisions we make, in the end. 

I hope this helps, and that everything works out for the better for both of you, whatever that turns out to be. Take care!",,1597789220,{},g21erta,False,t3_ica6ub,False,True,t3_ica6ub,/r/bulimia/comments/ica6ub/bulimia_personality_affects/g21erta/,1597798018,2,True,False,bulimia,t5_2tmc8,0,[],,,,,

Recently, I’ve noticed that even if there are many things in my life that I wish were perfect and they surely aren’t, I’m still surrounded by love and it was exactly the same when I was hating myself so bad and b/p everyday. This ED really affects your mood and your vision of the future and the present: is like a Matrix!
I know it changes from one person to another, but here there are some considerations that help me when I do want to binge/purge:
- if i b/p, my mood would be the worst and I wouldn’t be able to do anything. Life would seem unbearable.
- I cannot ask too much to myself, I deserve to be unproductive sometimes. When I need to rest, the day after I can do more and with a better mood.
- bulimia cancels just HALF of the calories I ingest. It’s better to distract and to walk or run if I don’t feel ok with what I ate.
- if I b/p I hate myself. If I hate myself I believe that nobody loves me and that I’m unworthy of respect.
- bulimia causes allucinations.
- after purging, my weight is still the same, even worse.
- if I cook my food and eat slowly, I’ll be more calm,
- I try not to have trigger food around. If it isn’t possible, I notice them and I try to stay away from the vision of the packet. Instead, I buy healthy food to snack and if I fill myself too much, at least is healthy food.

Does that mean for weight loss? One common factor of bulimia is that initially there is weight loss, and as the body ""adapts"" (goes into a starvation mode), the weight loss stops, the restriction and ""compensatory behaviors"" like purging and over-exercise become more severe, and the guilt and loss of control when eating increases, like the binging and nightly panic attacks you describe.

Don’t stop trying. Try different techniques.
I recently have tried to “restart” my brain addicition to sugar and my stomach addiction for the “fulness” feeling. First time, and hopefully, it will work.
I have fasted for 40hrs...
Working my way to a 3 day fast.
Besides my B/P i have no their medical condition, so fasting will not cause me harm.
I have not be able to stick to a 3 days fast
First time, 24hrs, got
2nd time I went to about 40hrs
It is more a battle with the mind them with the feeling of hunger... I did not feel hungry when I broke my fast... I was just bored and stressed...
I will try again soon
The amazing thing... is that things that you eat... flavor and sweetness is so much stronger after a fasting. A banana tasted sweet as icing from cupcakes... 
Maybe you can try this approach to restart your brain and stop being wired to things that makes you B/P

It took a lot of breakdowns in general, me saying I want to be done, feeling worthless, etc to finally get myself help. If you were going to forgo all other help, PLEASE see a therapist/psychologist/psychiatrist that specializes in ED. That step alone made me feel less isolated by my disorder &amp; opened up an entire world of thinking/recovery. 

It’s a lot of digging into your past traumas &amp; thoughts to determine what triggered your ED/dysmorphic thoughts. Once you sort of determine the cause (Ex: mine was the feeling I had to be perfect in every way) you can work on deconstructing that and reconstructing a healthy view of yourself w a lifestyle that accompanies it. 

Again, it’s different for everyone. A great (free) way to help yourself is to sit down with the book Intuitive Eating(available at most libraries &amp; recommended/used by ED recovery teams).

Basically, you’re gonna keep overeating after severe restriction because your body goes into this semi-starving state where you zone out and HAVE to get in nutrition. Then comes guilt, purging, the cycle repeats.
If you can try to commit to one week of being kind to your body and allowing yourself to eat 3!! Meals a day and even snacks, they don’t have to be big. And then sit with it, don’t purge or overdwell in it. It takes a while for your body and brain to adjust to being fed without the nutrition being taken away right after.
PS you might experience bloating because your body isn’t used to digesting. Just bear with me. ONE week.

I'd love to go get some professional help for it (since I've been struggling with this for a few years now and it seems to be getting much worse) but since i'm quite young and no one knows about my bulimia, it's just something I'll have to try and eventually stop on my own. I'm trying not to be so hard on myself lately, and it's definitely helped a little bit from a mental point of view, so now I think I'll just monitor myself and see what my main triggers are.

 Maybe I'll get a dairy of sorts to just monitor what I want and when, how much and if there's anything that I can't help but purge after having so I can avoid it! Hopefully this'll help me me stop eventually.

 Everyone starts somewhere after all, maybe I'll just take a little more time than I'd like to admit. But I refuse to believe that I can't recover form this, even if it does take a few more years. I'd definitely be worth it!

Over the years it’s changed, so that now I generally feel pretty neutral about my body- never beautiful, but never like I’m a monster.

Like if I stayed at my cw forever I’d be fine, but the thought of gaining even a couple pounds is terrifying. I’m always terrified I’ll start eating and never be able to stop, and that’s how I started purging, not to lose weight so much as just to not gain. 

For me, it seems like the amount I hate my body has very little to do with my weight, and more about how much I hate myself and my life. I’m at a point now where I’m doing well in college, finally made some friends, feel like an overall decent person. But when my ED started, I’d just dropped out of high school, had no friends, no plans for my future, felt like a total failure... it was a lot easier to put all that hatred and disappointment I felt about myself on my body and focus on what felt like the easiest part of me to fix at the time, as if being thin enough could at least give me something to like/be proud of.

But it’s still really weird that I’m a lot of ways, my ED has been so much worse (much more frequent b/p) for the past year even though I’ve started to be ok with my body most of the time.

worse, being an adoptee whose race isn’t the same as anyone in their family (i’m a POC, they’re all white). this lead to an ongoing identity crisis beginning in early childhood, one of which my adoptive parents did nothing to help me with. i was desperate to attain a sense of self.

i was also overweight for much of my childhood. didn’t make the situation any better, to say the least.

all of that lead to feeling like no one would love me, which was further proven by bullies and even people i considered friends, commenting on my weight. it started when i was around 8 years old, and didn’t let up until i was 14 and already deep into my eating disorder. i lost the weight and people noticed. i got compliments, praise, etc., so my disordered behavior was just being reinforced.

My advice is get some help. Reach out to your doctor if you can and or family. You need to go onto a meal plan that you will have to stick to or your body will honestly just stop working eventually. Your meal plan will seem scary at first but i guarantee after a month of consistent eating you will feel like a new person. Energy will be much better. No brain fog. Less anxiety/depression.

And I know exactly how that feels. You lose yourself in this illness. You feel like you have to hide because that’s what society expects of you, but you’re done hiding. You are broken and don’t think you can be fixed. But it doesn’t have to stay that way. 

I love poetry, especially songwriting, and I wrote my story through song as well. But I won’t share that here - I just wanted to say that I’ve been there and I’m glad that you can find an outlet through your art. 

Now - back to the hope. I’m a recovered bulimic and binge eater. I’m living in a freedom that I can write about without worrying if I’ll lose it again. You can recover. 

For me, it took coming to the end of myself. I had to accept I was powerless over my compulsive behaviors around food and I needed something outside myself - stronger than therapy or psychiatry, and lasting, not a diet or meal plan. 

Not everyone is powerless. Some can find recovery through the meal plan or group therapy or whatever it may be. If it works, go for it!

For me though, I was this chronic type of compulsive eater who could not leave food alone. Couldn’t stop thinking about it, eating it, purging it. My behavior was addictive. And whereas others could binge eat for a season and then return to normalcy, I couldn’t do the same. 

I am not normal. And I’ve accepted that. It’s ok if you’re not, and ok if you are. What matters is that you get the help you need.

I am here - if you want to talk about recovery, if you want someone to share your poems with who can truly appreciate them, if you are seeking something stronger that can help you overcome this illness, if you feel you’ve hit your rock bottom with something that has become an addiction — wherever you are.

I knew it wasn’t the healthier way to recovery... but eventually as the months went by, I got more and more scared of puking because I saw the progress i had made..

I also started losing weight, because I was eating less, so eventually I found my balance, and started eating larger portions as I became more confident that I wasn’t going to puke

When you’re starting DO NOT stock your house with ANY binge foods or trigger foods.  (If all food triggers you into a binge idk how to help).  For me it’s things like snacks and sweets and ice cream and crackers and cheese...  if you want a treat you have to go out to a store and buy a single serve of something.  When you do want to reduce their triggery effect buy it all in single serving packages for your home.  Take one package to your designated eating space or your couch watching tv etc.  Make a hard rule with yourself to take one at a time.  Sure you may still end up eating all the packets but you’ll have to get up to get each and every single one.  You’ll also see the trash accumulate.  It interrupts the binge giving you a chance to bail on it before it gets outta hand.  If you’re still hungry after just one and want a second serving then go for it.  We’re stopping binge eating not eating.  I still struggle with certain foods so I’ve bought some of those foods and I keep them at my office.  I am far less likely to binge eat at work where people can see me.  This way I get to eat my granola bars and popcorn and cookies every day and it’s controlled.  Learn substitutes for binge foods.  Like.  I like granola on fruit/yogurt but I’ll binge eat it.  I’m less likely to binge eat cereal.  So guess what goes on my fruit/yogurt parfaits now.  Bulimia is fucking hell.  I wish you all the best.  Life is so much better on the other side.  Oh.  And if you don’t already get a 1L water bottle and carry it with you everywhere.  Drink 2-4 at a minimum depending on your other fluid intake.  I live in kinda a desert area so I can drink 4 no problem and still get thirsty.

Like, my body felt so much better, I had more energy, my skin wasn't pale, face not swollen.(and really, you see it in your face but the bloating is everywhere, like my intestines were constantly distended, when I was purging a Lot, making me feel worse about myself). 
 But it was hard trying to find coping mechanisms that weren't just as harmful. I probably couldn't gave done it without my therapist and friends. Something that really helped was not letting myself be alone after eating. I didn't tell anyone thats what I was doing, but I'd make a plan to hang out, or sit with my roommate in the living room. It helped keep me accountable. 
But i think it just took time. Taking it one day at a time. I started small, just aiming for purging once a day, then once every other day, then just kept stretching the time between. I told myself I could always do it the next day, and kept putting it off. Its hard. Truly hard. But its also doable and super worth it. Im still not great, I relapse at Least once a month. But I'd like to think its getting easier. 

And just a side note, your body will get bloated when you stop purging. Your intestines aren't used to keeping the food and they kind of freak out. But it makes them happier cause they like nutrients and shit and they adjust and the swelling/bloat goes Way down. It can be painful tho. GasX and tums helped me lots.

You may find verbal interaction with someone face to face difficult and if thats the case I found that Samaratans helped as I could vocalise what I was feeling without looking into someones face at the same time. If you arent in the UK there are US etc versions of this charity.

Control issue? Why does he feel like he needs to take that control back, what has happened that has made him feel like he is out of control? Work together to find his triggers, and see what you can do to work with them (but don't expect him to just completely be over them).

Self harm? Is this replacing other forms of self harm? Reach out to local self harm charities, and try and push him to go to his doctor and talk about what is happening (this is important with the others too! It's scary but worth it, I promise!).

-do not ever brush your teeth straight after. you’re essentially rubbing stomach acid into your enamel. wait a couple hours before brushing. rinse ur mouth out with plain water or non-alcohol fluoride mouth wash instead! 

-stay away from acidic foods and drinks. stuff you wouldn’t even expect to be acidic could mess already damaged teeth up more. tomatoes, citrus fruits, concentrated fruit juices, sparkly water, soda. if you do partake, rinse your mouth well with water right after.

-keep up with regular dental hygiene. brush/floss 2x daily. see your dentist regularly and be upfront that you’re bulimic. yes, it’s embarrassing, but they can’t help you appropriately if they don’t know what’s up. they can offer you advice and protective treatments.

I wanted to let you know that I sadly will not be able to offer the $10 Amazon gift card for your participation anymore. I have received so many more willing participants for my study than I originally expected and want to be able to include as many people as possible. 

I originally was going to use my own money to use towards the gift cards and expected to maybe get about 5-6 people; however, the turn out has been SO much better than I expected! 

If this is something that makes you unwilling to participate in the study, I totally understand! I wish I could give the gift cards, but it would not be fair to give some informants a gift card and not others, but I also cannot afford to fund all of the gift cards.

I hope this is not an issue for you, but I completely understand if this changes your opinion on participating and will not be upset at all!

I get the strong urges to b/p. You have to make sure you're well fed to recover because hunger = bingeing. I know it's difficult but try not to think of the calories for now, and just eat nutritious, filling meals. Eat every few hours. 

I get the urge to binge after dinner in the evening. But if I can resist it for about 30 mins, it always goes away. Sticking to a routine helps me, and going for an evening walk at this time when I feel like bingeing usually curbs it. Also I cannot have binge foods in the house.

First things first, I was a bulimic for 8 years. I recovered by myself. BUT i was at rock bottom and willing to try anything. If you feel like you're there, then here's some things you can try. 

1. Tell yourself you're never purging again--then hold to it. If you purge ok, but be at a place where thats not your life anymore. You can binge all you want, and it aint going nowhere. (Get used to bingeing it's gonna happen, but it gets better every day. Less and less)
2. Start a meditation practice. You need to learn to sit with your uncomfortable feelings. You need to be ok with feeling shitty. I recommend starting small, 5 minutes, 3 times a day. Slowly move up to 10 then 20. Keep pushing yourself. 
3. Understand that your urges to check the mirror, binge, purge etc--are all anxiety. Anxiety is a pushing away of emotion. What happened to you that you're pushing away? Work on journaling. Write out your feelings as they come. Work on body movement. Make walking, getting in nature regular practice. Stretch, jog whatever. Anxiety thrives on lack of body movement.

I went to a psychiatrist for the first time over the summer (she focuses on EDs), she wanted me to start Prozac for my anxiety and depression but I never did even though I got them.  My last appointment with her earlier this month, we discussed how since I decided not to take it I could start doing therapy instead. I haven’t done that so far either due to being busy with graduate school and getting my Masters degree but I’m thinking about it.

Normally, I'd have left him. He was always so sweet but finding all these texts destroyed me.. The reason why I'm still here is because I have no friends anymore, my family lives far away and I've spend all my money because we recently moved together, I'm not able to leave him and I have nowhere to go right now.. And it's naive and stupid but the little happy moments give me hope, even though I know this love is dead, I know it and I told him, we broke up but he won't accept it.
