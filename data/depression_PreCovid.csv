[],,sirmao187,,,[],,,,text,t2_1622a0,False,False,[],"First off, don‚Äôt let yourself be defined by those numbers and terms. You‚Äôre a person. You‚Äôre deserving of happiness. At least as much as the rest of us are. Sure, you‚Äôve got problems. But in seeing them, you only really have two options as far I can see. You can allow yourself to be those problems, allow them to swallow you up and become them. Or you can face them, head on and with determination. And maybe there you can at least do something about them. Maybe there you can take control. And then maybe a little control is all you need. Find creative solutions. If you‚Äôve tried everything you can to drive, maybe take the bus. Maybe bike. 

Try and find moments in the day to appreciate life, breath in some fresh air outside and feel your lungs absorbing it. Feel the sun on your skin. Think of how you‚Äôre alive, and that must mean something. Even if you don‚Äôt have meaning, even if you can‚Äôt attribute any meaning to it. You‚Äôre here, breathing, reading, interpreting. And that must mean something. Maybe that‚Äôs enough. 

Get sleep, proper sleep. No more going to bed late, no more waking up late. Exercise and reach out to a loved one, or someone you can talk to. Tell them you‚Äôre feeling down, and maybe you don‚Äôt need much, just someone to vent to or someone to check up on you. Lean on someone, and return the favor when you‚Äôre strong enough to be leaned on. I know this third point is much much MUCH easier said than done, but it‚Äôs a must. It‚Äôll improve your attitude tremendously, which has a snowball effect of helping you take on other things that bother you. 

Don‚Äôt torment yourself with pointless questions. If you do, try and stop them with other questions. Instead of thinking,‚Äùmaybe it won‚Äôt work‚Äù think,‚Äùmaybe it will work‚Äù. ‚ÄúMaybe there is a point in living life‚Äù ‚Äúmaybe my suffering won‚Äôt be for nothing‚Äù 

Maybe pick up a hobby. Volunteer your time. Force yourself to meet new people. If you can. If you can‚Äôt that‚Äôs okay. But at least you‚Äôre thinking of ideas instead of staying where you are. That‚Äôs just it. Don‚Äôt stay where you are. I know when it rains it pours, and it‚Äôs easy to think my life is bad so it‚Äôll get worse, but if you can take a little control and make your life a little better, you might find that when it‚Äôs sunny it shines brilliantly. You just gotta take those steps, and move from where you are now to where you will be. 

Most importantly, find what works for you. Make a calendar, or don‚Äôt. Talk to someone, or don‚Äôt. Face your fear of driving, or don‚Äôt. Do everything I said above, or a combination, or none of it. Whatever it is, listen to your gut and body and mind, and find ways to make them all work for you rather than against you. 

I realize that this may be things you know, or things you‚Äôve heard and putting them into practice is much more difficult than what I make them out to be. Unfortunately, these words of encouragement are all I can do to try and help you out of your rut. But you‚Äôve gotta heed them, and take on the demons on your own.

To be honest I never went to prom, and my graduation day wasnt anything super special. High school was ok for me, and I didnt hate it or love it. I'm sorry, I can only sympathize with you with what you're feeling.

But I will say this- as much fun as people have with prom and graduation, I dont think that's what high school builds you up for. It builds you up for your 20s, and your college years (if you do indeed choose to go to college- I know you said you dont know what you're doing). And your 20s will probably be the best and worst years of your life. You will find the friends that will be with you for most of your life (everyone told me that, and they weren't wrong), whether through college, or jobs.

I'm absolutely not telling you to just ignore the pain- you have the right to mourn these events you've been looking forward to, and you should give yourself time to mourn them. But try to allow yourself to look forward to the future, and what that might bring. Maybe you can get a job and save up to go to Hawaii yourself! If there was someone special you wanted to go to prom with, once the quarantine subsides, you can take them on a 'date' or just a fun night to make up for prom.

Myself, I probably couldn't make anybody laugh if they paid me a million dollars. Ironically my inability to be humorous forms a large part of the basis for my poor self-esteem, social isolation and feelings of depression that arise as a consequence.

Life is a wild perplexing trip and for you to Not let these emotions eat your mind body and soul by keeping it in. Instead you made a constructive and conscious decision to unravel what you‚Äôre going through to us all who are reading your post!

Proud of you. I know it Fk!ng sucks and the negativity is such an easy thing to do at times like these. Do Not let these times win though, mental illness is a challenge, and you‚Äôre friends or ‚Äúfriends‚Äù they may just need a break for whatever reason or maybe they‚Äôre really gone.

I got in my own fn head and decided to quit my job.

Scared me because Ive been doing great but we mustn‚Äôt keep it inside.

If you can't go therapy, there are always online sources where you can get help from and express your thoughts. 

I would recommend that you write a journal/diary each day because it allows you to express your thoughts (and that feels good). You can always use the journal/diary to help explain to others what you're feeling. If you need someone to talk to, you can aways talk to me :)

But what I've found that works for me is just smiling in the mirror and saying I don't fucking care. I like being happy and if I don't like my body I try to change what I can, but I don't change myself for others because i like who i am. If you don't like your body, hit the gym, do some squats, work on perfecting what you want to chsnge. But don't do it because you are afraid to feel unwanted if you dont. Ive never had a girlfriend and I'll be a junior in college in 4 months, I always feel like I'm unwanted and unattractive because no one expresses interest in me, but I like who I am, so I hope there will be someone soon who finds me attractive, both in personality and looks. But hey if not, I still like me, so who cares :)

,,CapaTheGreat,,,,,,,,t2_13iaad,,,,"It's easier said than done bro. Like it's physically restricting to get my schoolwork done. It brings me pain to even look at a paper assigned to me. I'm low on dopamine (whatever chemical it is) levels and I need something to make me happy again first and homework isn't the answer. The feeling of getting stuff done isn't the answer. 

So that's why I slack off. And then feel shittier about myself for not having done said assignments. It's a vicious cycle. I want it to end. But I can't break out. I feel hopeless because I don't have motivation to achieve something. I compare myself to others who are getting amazing grades and taking hard and challenging classes because they are so gifted and I'm not. They're getting awesome scholarships because they're better than me. 

We are not created equal. I believe that sometimes, or most of the time whenever I feel this way. Some people are just simply better than others. And I don't believe that crap that ""everyone goes through struggles"". Hmm, yeah it's really hard to see that when I see kids in the hallways at school laughing and smiling and then there's me. A 17 year old, acne covered, chubby, tired, and stupid kid who has nothing going for him. High school makes me feel like complete shit. It's inhumane. Yet I have no other choice but to suffer.

Please don't do heroin Again. You will never get the same high but you don't need it. 
It's the same when you have an amazing girlfriend - no other girl compares. 
And it can be hard. I have been spending years searching for the next high with life - without drugs. 
I have played in bands. I have had success. I have won money gambling. 
But whatever high you have there will always be a comedown. 
I know nothing will compare to heroin, but don't give in to the temptation. You will destroy yourself more and more. There is always a new low. And even though you feel shit now it will only get worse if you keep doing heroin.

Also, you don't have to make a jump. It really doesn't matter if you do or don't. No rush and no worries. I think a lot of people in various religions don't actually believe but go along with it for cultural reasons. 

I come from a fairly secular country and I was born into a secular family. One of my uncles almost died from alcoholism, but then turned to Islam and turned me to it. I was maybe 11 at that time. Around your age I started having doubts and decided to put my religion on hold. Over time more and more I saw that religion is nonsense. 

I too used to believe that Quran is amazing and that I wasn't educated enough to understand it all. Truth is that Quran is kind of boring and not that good. For example, in college philosophy you will study Plato and Aristotle but not Quran. Why not? Wouldn't God be a better philosopher than Socrates? You would think God would write more interesting stories than J,K. Rowling, but nobody prefers Quran over Harry Potter. Business people in the west will take wisdom from Sun Tzu's Art of war but not from Quran. 

As for all the stupid rules that are unfair to women, well back in the bad-old days women had no power and their survival depended on getting married. People lived on the very edge of survival, so a woman that had sex before marriage was basically done for. That is why a lot of religions were so strict on women to control their sexuality.

For a long time I had a hard time separating the thoughts ‚Äúthings suck and it would be easier if I were dead because I wouldn‚Äôt need to deal with hard things anymore‚Äù and ‚Äúthings suck and I wish I were dead so I wouldn‚Äôt need to deal anymore‚Äù. It‚Äôs not dangerous to yourself to acknowledge that dead people don‚Äôt have responsibilities or worries, but it is dangerous when you start wanting to be dead. Passive suicidal ideation (‚ÄúI hope a bus hits me while I‚Äôm crossing the street‚Äù) can morph into active suicidal tendencies (‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to step in front of the bus‚Äù). If you get help in the passive stage, it‚Äôs much easier. I just can‚Äôt think of an easily consumable way of talking about suicide that frankly though. 

You could also try to highlight normal vs depressive behaviors and reactions. Have a big breakup and struggle to leave your apartment for a week? Normal, if intense, reaction to a bad thing happening. Have a big breakup and struggle to leave your apartment for three months plus not taking great care of your personal hygiene or excessively missing work/school? Not normal and probably a sign that you have depression. 

You could call attention to normal depression symptoms. Poor personal hygiene, excessive absences from school/work, withdrawal from friend groups, general hopelessness or melancholy, dreading waking up in the morning, and lack of interest in hobbies or in general not caring when you used to are all signs and symptoms (but obviously not an exhaustive list) that can be recognized in oneself sooner than in others and people should know to look out for that. Catching and treating depression early makes a difference in overall quality of life. 

Even if you completely ignore the rest of my comment, I hope you listen to this part and pass it along at least. If you are really unhappy, don‚Äôt jump right to blaming yourself for some moral or psychological failing compared to the others around you; go talk to a therapist who can help you work out the cause of your unhappiness and work with you via talk therapy, cognitive and behavioral therapy, and/or coordinating with a psychiatrist for meds in order to make positive steps forward in your life.

Selfishness is all about self preservation and self benefit. Ending yourself is the complete opposite of self preservation. You don't personally benefit from dying, it's a frightening and painful experience and then you're gone forever. To commit suicide, you have to overcome the self preservation instinct and the fear of pain in order to injure yourself badly enough to die. That's why many people struggle with successfully commiting suicide, or actually going through with it. It takes a lot of bravery and detachment from self to actually do it.

Furthermore, ending yourself can be seen as a selfless act that is beneficial to others, because you are no longer using up resources or exploiting anyone else in order to keep yourself breathing (such as purchasing products made by low paid/slave laborers, or products that cause suffering to animals, or products that have destroyed their habitat).

If you are like me, your brain is screaming at you that maybe this is just an elaborate ruse to get attention, or an excuse. Feeling that way is relatively common for people with depression. It's one of the reasons why depression can be so insidious; it sometimes feels like it is actively trying to stop you getting better.

You don't deserve to be in pain, you aren't a coward for not hurting yourself, and you aren't alone in feeling how you feel.

 *I wasn't posting because I thought I was getting better*

I wasn't posting because there was time where I felt differently and not like I do now.

&amp;#x200B;

*Everything has been getting worse* 

Everything? Did kittens get less cute? No, but the kittens aren't helping you feel better. That doesn't mean kittens got less cute, it means you won't feel like this forever. This is not forever. This is today. Tomorrow is tomorrow. One day. At a time. No more, you can't. No one can. Only focus on TODAY. It will pass.

&amp;#x200B;

 *found out that I was burning, and didn't do a god damn thing about it.*  

To cry out and plead inwardly and outwardly for the people who are supposed to love you to care but they slap you for it, so you feel utterly and completely alone. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

It sounds like they may be afraid, or anxious, and have no idea what to do. Also this borders on emotional abuse. No amount of anger and proverbial slapping on their part is going to change you, it can't be forced out. Rational people know this. Which leads a sane person to think they are afraid. Fearful people act immediately, and if they immediately reacted with anger it's not really what they are thinking. Something triggered the thought chain. ""We're going to prison."" ""Our kid is getting taken away."" Who knows what.

&amp;#x200B;

You really need healing and your parents need to take you seriously. You might have to be your own advocate and look for services in your area, or even call DHS on yourself. An agent will always show up to check (In America at least), which WILL force them to react. (The check doesn't always lead to anything but it will get attention from your family.) It might be a negative reaction, or they might break down. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is really, REALLY hard to ask for anything directly from care givers when you're not heard to begin with. It would be really hard to tell them you need help. It's hard for a person of any age, let alone a minor to make the choice. There are always too many what-ifs cycling over and over and negative voices screaming all the reasons help is bad and harmful, while tying the person down and scarring them in their own bodies. Help is the devil, stay here and be 'safe.'

&amp;#x200B;

But you do need help, that someone who is fully invested in your future and your well being and progress. In whatever form that comes, PLEASE don't give up. It can get better, and you will become very strong from living through these days, but the best thing you can do for yourself is do not give up yet. It's not your time. Keep going.

If anything I guess my input on your situation is, to stop being so critical and  self conscious about how people perceive you.

People are incredibly superficial but sometimes they actually like vulnerability. A small dosage but they do like it. It makes them feel like there is trust and that makes them feel good sometimes if they can help (but it's incredibly upsetting to them if they can't help).

A B? Are the brush strokes good enough for an A? Doesn't matter, art makes you feel something. And that's good art/photography. Even if it only feels like something to YOU.

If someone asked you to paint a tree, it's not exactly invigorating or thought provoking. The secret to creativity (besides hiding your sources, according to Leonardo) is limitation. Draw the tree. With triangles. Suddenly.. Your tree is completely one of a kind.

&amp;#x200B;

So you have a limitation. A lense for all other things to move through, and it's up for you to decide that the grade doesn't matter. What matters if what's under the focus of the lense. Think about what you really hope to do at least once and how you might get there. Someone could be anyone. YOU'RE someone. It always starts with someone. You're someone. Who can. It's not the grade, that doesn't matter. It's the outcome- what are you hoping to achieve? 

&amp;#x200B;

The grade might matter more if you just REALLY have to get into a university because you want to be the first person to reproduce a particular plant in captivity. And then on mars, Or you just really like volcanos, or orca whales, or sounds we can't hear with our ears. Whatever strange unique thing deep inside you like that makes you you, that's what you're doing the hard work for. The grade can't tell you that you're an amazing person- those qualities can't be measured. We've been trying to measure them for years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Beautiful paintings start with a single stroke that's kinda ugly. Oak trees came out of a fat nut with a hat.

On the flip side in my experience with SSRIs and SNRIs this kind of stuff happens.  If i was in your shoes I would also wait a bit.  These things typically take 4 to 6 weeks to show their full effect and it's preemptive to discuss every minor up and down.  

So yea, normal, I would see where it goes and mention it at the end of the month.  

Don't though rule out other medications.  Some people find ones that work well, and SSRIs have a good safety track record overall. So I wouldn't fear switching.  This is really something you should talk over with your psychiatrist, but I agree waiting until appointment is the way to go.  It's just too soon to really make a judgement.

I'm prescribed for ADD/mild ADHD but I don't experience symptoms quite like that. I do get slightly more energy and can focus more but otherwise I feel generally normal. Similar to how you described it.

Maybe have your therapist make a recommendation to a psychiatrist about both your concerns and receive an evaluation to see if you're fit to get on medication. My situation is similar to yours, but switched. I was already on Adderall but it began to not work very well (towards school) and so both my therapist &amp; psychiatrist recommended me to go on antidepressants. Psychiatrist thought it'd help make the ADD medication more effective for me and my therapist thought I needed them because of the changes in my life and my vulnerability at the time. And even if in the end it's not ADHD, you're not a lazy sack of shit. Since you're on this thread, I assume you've been going through some tough stuff.

I really hate when I get attached and interested in someone, want to know more about them, and they just ghost ghost ghost. I hate having to contact them for them to say ""Oh sorry I was \_\_\_"" You were doing that for TWO WEEKS? And then you have a good convo, then they ghost again.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes you just have to have some real friends around, work up to that point, and just tell them it was nice meeting them but you don't talk enough and have other things going on, good luck and goodbye. All sane adult people will completely understand.

&amp;#x200B;

By the way I could use some more online friends, I don't have nearly enough and I'm pretty lonely. If you want another warm body to talk to. Can't say it would lead to awesomeness but it would be a nice distraction! I can initiate.

,,wayfarer_jr,,,[],,,,text,t2_1f8d801l,,,,"Also, the very fact that I have been relatively aggressive these past couple of years in pursuit of a viable treatment precludes me from many clinical trials. Ain‚Äôt that a kick in the head? 

I was reading about some trials in Chicago, which is only about 100 miles from where I am, for new pharmaceuticals for people with treatment resistant depression, but it‚Äôs limited to people who have tried something like three or fewer medications. Part of that is because many of the newer meds are just different spins on older ones and they are seeking approval, so they need a trial pool that has a greater chance of success. 

At Johns Hopkins, they‚Äôre doing clinical trials utilizing synthetic psilocybin, the psychoactive component of ‚Äúmagic‚Äù mushrooms, but I don‚Äôt qualify for that one either, even if I could afford to be there for the several weeks that would be required, because my depression didn‚Äôt respond to ECT. Too, say that did work for me, it‚Äôs a one-off trial. Funding and legal support are so limited with regard to psychedelics that they can only deliver the single trial run to patients. And, they‚Äôre finding that, while the treatment can be highly effective, it must be re-administered periodically. The same is going on in the UK right now with their psilocybin trials. It‚Äôs helped many of the participants, but, when those participants come back in some months as their symptoms return, they‚Äôre being turned away because the organization can not afford to administer it to them. They have to limit administration of it to acquire the necessary data in the hope that it will, someday, be an accepted and standard form of treatment. 

Other groups are performing parallel trials utilizing LSD or MDMA, but I don‚Äôt qualify for those either, largely because I‚Äôm not a veteran and treating veterans strikes an emotional chord with people that makes it easier to get the funding and legal support. 

To many people, it appears as though I‚Äôm not trying. But, I probably know more about psychopharmacology at this point than my GP at least, and maybe as much as the psychiatrist I was seeing, because I research. My now-former psychiatrist refused to even research different options that I asked her about. I generally don‚Äôt/can‚Äôt do shit, but I sit in bed with my smartphone and I research as I‚Äôm able to.

Sure, there may be people who aren‚Äôt trying to get better, but an important part of that is to understand why. A lack of trying is a potential symptom of major depression, so even that is not so simple. And, there is the internal battle too. Most people in my circles have no idea that I‚Äôve undergone four months of electroconvulsive therapy. There‚Äôs a lot of stigma around mental health, and even more with something like ECT, so people don‚Äôt tend to be very open. I‚Äôm much more open than I used to be because just about every shred of dignity and pride I had has been torn away anyway. It‚Äôs too much work to pretend all the time, to hide behind some fa√ßade.

I realize, in hindsight, that my responses may be coming off a tad aggressive, and I don‚Äôt mean for them to. I‚Äôm just trying to, as I said before, offer perspective.

Trust me weed sucks for me now. It means nothing. 10 year pothead. On and off.
Point is, it's a fact that drugs harm your body. One day you wake up and it hits you. It feels like you been in a coma for years. You wake up and get off drugs realize how better the world is without having to depend on them. You feel stupid for spending money on drugs instead of an entertainment system. All your money, you have nothing to show for. your miserable cause your broke. 


Point is, we've all been there. We wanted an escape. Even if its for a moment. The problem is we get lost and we fall asleep on all our dreams and ambitions. Because you wish to escape, we don't set an alarm clock to wake us  up. No. We stay asleep for years lost to drugs. Eventually without an alarm clock (or a scheduled date where you decide to stop using drugs aka tolerance break), you miss life. You been asleep for years. Perhaps a decade.


Life wakes you up, somehow! Whether it's a trip to the hospital, losing some one, ending up homeless. Point is, one day you wake up. 


It's a double edged sword, bro. I know, I know. I hate my younger self for following that lost path that led me nowhere. It destroys your body. So future me pays for the consequences, basically I set myself up as my greatest enemy .

Just be straight forward with him cuz most men are very straight forward people so it would be easier to understand not matter how stupid what you are saying may seem to you.

i know this was just supposed to be a rant but imo, when you say this,:
&gt; I struggle to eat and sleep
personally i found that sticking by schedules is rly helpful. even if you're not hungry, try to force yourself to eat a little bit and at the same times everyday and you'll eventually get used to eating normal meals at those times. same with sleep: use alarms at first to wake up so you don't oversleep (but ofc don't get sleep deprived also lol)

obviously this didn't cure my depression but i didn't push people like my family as often when i was less cranky from deprived sleep/hunger. people underestimate effects of food and sleep when it actually can help you a lot.
anyways best of luck &amp; hang in there ‚ò∫

I had my first suicidal ideations when I was about nine. Just the morbid ‚ÄúI could kill myself and end it all, look at all these things that could kill me, how tempting‚Äù type of thinking. It continually got worse and I self harmed the first time at the age of 13. In fact it was 1 am on my 13th birthday, and repressed memories from 5th grade came back as a birthday gift to me.

People like to pretend that bad things can‚Äôt happen to children, and that we‚Äôre all innocent no matter what happens to us. They often blind themselves to the fact that they‚Äôre causing us more harm in assuming this, as they‚Äôre denying us the help we so desperately need. That‚Äôs why after years of struggling with self harm and suicidal thoughts I‚Äôm still being told it‚Äôs for attention.

That when 10 year old me stayed up crying until 5 am alone on a school night it was because I thought taking antidepressants (which I‚Äôm only now starting at 17 years old) was an edgy and cool thing. Because when I had cut myself countless times on my birthday with no knowledge of anyone I knew doing so it was because I wanted to fit in with kids at school.

I went to a lawyer with my dad to get custody revoked from my mom, my arms and legs completely covered after just four days (my non neglectful parent found out pretty easily I was self harming) of self harming, and she told my dad that I was splitting my wrists because I wanted to live with my dad because he ‚Äúprobably had better cable or something‚Äù.

It‚Äôs sickening how people can write off other people‚Äôs struggles like that. I really hate to think about how many kids who‚Äôve been denied proper care because of age.

I don't know you personally but I think you are a good person . The negativity is just a piece of how you feel about the world. I'm certain you can find a relationship with someone who likes how you are. My therapist says I can too but my insecurities disagree with me. 

Well I'm glad your anxiety and panic attacks have improved from it. If I may ask, how do you exactly feel about the world? What is so negative about your views ?

I must give it to you, there are many things you have tried. It is deeply unfortunate that you have not had much luck. I would just cheer you on to not to give up and to keep on trying. I find no meaningful reason to suggest giving up. Yeah you might save some energy to accept depression but for what? To hate life with more enthusiasm? It's still possible you will find something better for yourself. Even if it is drastically more difficult in a very unfair way. I can't promise things will get better soon, but it's possible they will. You have people that love you and suicide shouldn't be an option for their sake if no other reason. 

Have you tried acid? There are scientific studies showing efficacy of treating depression with psychedelic use, but of course in very controlled and productive conditions. If you tried that and it was negative , scrap that idea as well.

Just know you are NOT alien. There are many depressed people among us. I'm definitely one even if I am also manic at other times . And treatment resistant depression is a very real thing. It's just that most of the most severe cases involve people near completely immobilized so they stay home.  You have a degree of strength that is very rare.

,,littlewolfgirl_12,,,[],,,,text,t2_izxxu65,False,,,"You're both basically on auto-pilot, using your phones as a way of disassociating from reality. I'd say that if you were both fully committed to battling your depression, it could make your relationship stronger, and it could be beneficial that you both have someone who understands. When one of you is feeling down, the other can pick up the slack and act as the motivator, and you trade off. But, if one of you is continuously more committed than the other, it'll only drag you both down. I'd say talk to your bf and see if he wants to try and turn things around, and if he does, give it your best effort. But if he isn't committed, you have to get out of the toxic relationship. 

Some things that have helped my depression:
* Taking long walks through the woods with my dog.
* Lavender bubble baths (With books NOT a phone!).
* Physical activity (I like hot yoga, hiking, skiing, etc).
* Do something for others (I like volunteering with animals).
* Better yourself (I went back to college and it makes me excited for the future. You don't have to go to college, but learn something! Learn a foreign language or something ""useful"" that's still fun).
* Drink plenty of water, eat healthy, nourishing food, and take supplements (I think magnesium is good for depression? I don't take supplements but I heard they can improve your mood).
* Most importantly, try going cold turkey with your phones. Nothing will improve when you're a slave to the internet. You're just wasting time.

It makes meaningful relationships incredibly hard, everyone says they can deal with it, very few can.

In my experience, relationships feel trapping not because they really are, but because we are afraid of losing something. Perhaps of losing the other person, of losing our good image in our eyes or another's, of losing trust or losing a sense of security. It leads to a sense of paralyzation.

I think most people's response is to ruminate on how to fix the past, and it doesn't really lead anywhere, seeing as how the past can't be undone. The only thing we can do to feel better in those situations is to do the right thing, regardless of what we might lose. To be honest about where we went wrong, compassionately stand our ground on what we did right, and honestly ask for what we want in the future. It's not easy, but it's the only consistent strategy I've found to feel almost as if the past is truly behind me, and it usually leads to healthier relationships and a better reconciliation. And I've done some awful things. 

I know that probably doesn't help a whole lot, but I hope it's relieving to know you are not the only person who has made mistakes like this before, and that things can get better.

My advice is to find something and master it, hobby, talent, anything.  Something to pour your feelings into.  It will always be there for you when nothing else is. It is a great way to build relationships.

About the GF.  Don‚Äôt feel bad. Think of the type of person who would like you and find a way to inhabit a space they might be.  You have to be visible.  Don‚Äôt try to be something you aren‚Äôt in the process.  Someone will like you for who you are and if they don‚Äôt you don‚Äôt need them.

How will you survive? Largely through your own doing, many will disappoint you along the way.

I read your other comment and it feels familiar. In my three years of intense suicidal depression, I tried many things to relieve myself of it. From therapy to drugs to recklessness to exercise to literally running away across the globe and I never recovered one iota from any of it. In truth they're all helpful activities but not until you're very close to the top of the hole.

It's my personal experience that our particular sort of depression is not something that can be alleviated slightly or be distracted from. Nor is it purely medical, despite having a medical component. It is a deeply personal and challenging question about the very root meaning of our lives, with the due date for an answer inevitably coming closer with each second we age. It is not about hobbies or exercise or jobs. That's not what's important. It's about what we decide to do with our lives that will make the last breath meaningful. Lacking that overarching meaning in life creates a deep depression that no relationship, hobby, drug, or distraction can help in the long term, because they feel totally purposeless and joyless without that big meaning.

That was a big weird ramble but I hope it helps in some way. Finding that meaning, creating it, turned out to be those dirt steps upwards, and it was the only thing that helped me after years of struggle.

,,briative,,,[],,,,text,t2_130gc5,,,,"Hi friend. I graduated college a couple years ago with a BS and BA in cell biology and biochemistry, respectively, and I have depression and anxiety. It can be done, but it‚Äôs not easy (as you know). 

There isn‚Äôt one real secret. As someone else mentioned, the slight ‚Äúbenefit‚Äù (if you can call it that) of having anxiety is that it gives you a crippling fear of failure and can serve as some motivation. Depression is a bitch. I had many, many days where I was stuck in bed feeling run down like I had the flu. I missed classes because I just stared at my wall all day. 

One of the major things that I wish I‚Äôd done earlier in college was consulting with Disability Resources. My anxiety made my test taking experiences absolutely unbearable, and they helped me get accommodations for that. Even if there aren‚Äôt accommodations they can offer for the days when your depression is kicking your ass, they may have additional resources and be able to listen to you. 

I‚Äôm not sure how far you are in your program, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. If you want to graduate, you can. There is absolutely no shame in taking a semester off to focus on your mental health (my ex did that in his second year of college and graduated on time with a STEM degree). If you aren‚Äôt able to do the bare minimum, a break may be necessary. 

If you aren‚Äôt on medication already, I strongly suggest you talk to a psychiatrist who can help you evaluate this. My depression zaps my energy, so I‚Äôm on lexapro for my anxiety and Wellbutrin XL for my depression. The Wellbutrin is meant to give you a bit more energy and motivation. It‚Äôs hit or miss, but it is worth considering. If meds aren‚Äôt your jam, see if you can get in to therapy. It really does help. 

I wish there was a magic formula to make this process easier, but there isn‚Äôt. It comes down to you. You CAN do this. Even if you take longer to finish or you take some time off, you can get that degree. It‚Äôs a hard battle, but it pays off. Don‚Äôt give up.

,,GeeBrain,,,,,,,,t2_gje6s,,,,"I'm so sorry you feel this way. If it's any consolation, it seems that many responses are in the same boat? I'm about your age (23) and because of childhood trauma I'm unable to process or feel emotions very well or at all. Because of this I don't have much passion or motivation in life; I don't have anything to believe in. The day to day of living like this for the past decade makes my depression and anxiety worse, because I never truly feel ""human."" 

It's weird. 

I would go on dates, and ""perform"" the part of a good partner: be witty, humorous, generous, kind, etc. But it is difficult for me to process the feelings associated with these actions. In fact, though I love my parents, I can't seem to feel love. On the flip side, I don't feel sad either, or angry. I would feel something, but it would wash over very quickly. In order to function properly, I learned to pay attention to social cues and ""act"" appropriately. My ex and I broke up because of this; while she loved me, and I love her, I could not process these emotions on a raw, human level. Instead I would analyze actions and words and try to deduce what is the right response. But I think I loved her. 

In any case, I've been working with my therapist, and I got a dog. She told me that if I could learn to love and be affectionate towards a dog, maybe it's a good first step towards being closer to feeling that way towards people. She said relationships take time to develop. And you have to learn who to trust. I decided that maybe I was not ready to be in a relationship with other because I don't much of a relationship with myself. 

I guess long story short. I think we are both very young and have lots of time. People will come and go from our lives but one thing is constant: us. We have to live with ourselves. For me, the first step is to try and be comfortable with my own feelings and learn to cry, smile, and laugh -- to feel. I think that my journey towards finding myself, my emotions, towards a level of acceptance for who I am, and who I was, will lead me to others.

Maybe they will see my tattered and broken soul and run and hide. Maybe they will see the pieces that I've painstaking collected, roll up their sleeves, and help put me them back together. 

I'm not sure. But at the end of the day, one thing is certain, I only have myself. 

I want to be better. I want to feel something, anything. And I think I'll start by trying to feel love for myself. 

So I'm with you. Though we may never meet and you might not even read this, I am with you. There are many embarking on this journey with us. And we will make it, because even broken glass glitters.

Humans are social creatures and need love and affection before they can feel happy. You seem to be confident enough and sure of yourself I don't see any reason why you wouldn't be able to get laid. You're more than capable man. Much luck to you.

,,Micha293,,,,,,,,t2_17fuej,,,,"While you're parents are right that your life will be tough with next to no education, it's absolutely *crucial* that you're in the right state of mind when going to school so you can do well and remember the information. There's no point in getting a degree if you're barely passing your classes or learning anything. You should really stay and finish. But that doesn't mean keep being miserable, it just means if you need to take time off to help yourself, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. 

My major depression almost got me kicked out of college last year. At the end of the spring semester last year I was on academic probation for the third time and was basically going to get kicked out if I didn't do a medical leave. My parents were never a fan of taking time off, but I basically had no choice. It was supposed to be just the summer, then it turned into fall as well, and now it's spring as well. But in this past year I've improved so much. I started going to therapy, being treated for depression, seeing a specialist to help with my concentration and memory, it's helped tremendously. 

I would tell your parents that it's crucial you take this time off to work on yourself, but definitely have a plan of what you're going to do during this time so they know you just don't want another semester off to lounge around. Commit to seeing a psychiatrist for depression, therapist, etc. But don't drop out. You will regret it. Especially after all the time and work you've put into it. You'll spend decades trying to pay off your college bills, which will be miserable, especially with a low-wage job.

Thinking back, I can't say enough how much taking that break would've benefitted me, regardless of how long it would've been. Do your parents know about your depression? If so, how in depth? Maybe they dont understand the severity..but I think they're wrong in pressuring you to go back if you don't feel ready. I know its tough feeling that pressure from parents, but you have to think about your future as well. If you go back now, only to return to the old routine, how would that benefit you? If it wouldn't, then don't go back. But if you HAVE made progress and are just scared for things to go back to the way they were, remember that they don't necessarily have to.

I dont want to act like Im someone who is worst than u or adding more pain to your feelings but heres a little about me. In reality, Im a scared-to-die person as well. I also seem to have a talent in being skill-less too. One example is that, I picked up a guitar to learn and I can't even play something proper after 4 years. Compare to others I know who started practicing it later than me, they are now so good that they can probably perform in a gig already. I also have a driving license but I dont drive a lot. By a lot I meant 90% of the time. Cus im a pussy, I afraid I'll land myself into accidents or other drivers out there judging my parking, over think &amp; etc... I dealt with quite a lot of pressure and stress when learning. Almost caused some motorcyclist to swerve and skid, thank god he didnt. That very moment made me lose all confidence but I had no choice, I can't quit as I already paid quite an amount for it. I also screwed up my studies and now I dont have a particular skill which can provide me a stable income.

I have the same thinking as you. Low in self-confidence, always thinks that others are better than me and I dont deserve shit. I am so self-aware of these things to the point which makes me re-think on how can I slowly change all these crazy thoughts away... Right now I am satisfied that I have found some motivation to change my life.

Or, a mentor?  A coach?

The most you can do is just bullshit yourself. Use distraction to keep yourself from thinking too much about wasting your time or time already wasted. You're still pretty damn young, so you've got time to do stuff! Thirty is when things start going downhill and you have several more years before you hit that awful milestone.

And as far as the employment gap, just say something like you did odd jobs/freelance work or took care of an ailing loved one.

Definitely explore careers and fields you are more interested in and feel passionate about. You don't need to go to an expensive 4 year college to find a good job.

Why not just feel it? We spend so much energy trying to ""fix"" ourselves and push feelings away...why not embrace it? I'm not saying fall into a casm of hopelessness and stop getting out of bed. Just let yourself be depressed. It sounds like you are more exhausted from FIGHTING depression than actually being depressed...see what I mean?

Accept it. You're depressed. Now what? Now get up and go eat because it's breakfast and you're hungry. Still feeling depressed? What do you want to do? Nothing. Okay go sit on the couch and stare at the wall. I bet after awhile you'll feel like doing something, even if it's void of any joy. 

You can do things and still feel depressed. I think we stop doing things when we're depressed because we think that activity needs to make us feel a certain way and other people pressure us. I've certainly felt depressed and still gone to a concert. So stop forcing yourself to feel what you don't feel but keep doing activities.

I say just try this for a week. Accept that you're depressed, let yourself feel depressed, but also focus on just ""well what do I want?"" Realistic wants. You can't say ""well i want a million dollars"" because you can't have that lol. But you can say ""I want to watch TV all day"" or whatever. Then do that.

[],,itll_be_fine,,,[],,,,text,t2_mfalb,False,,,"I wouldn't consider medication as patching up a leaking ship. I think of medication as giving the you the strength, energy, and stability to patch up the ship yourself. 

I'm also unsure if current research has validated the idea of chemical imbalances, it seems to be a lot more complex and nebulous than that. But medications do work for a lot of people, and if they can help you manage your life then it is definitely worth a try. But medication is generally considered a short term solution, as in they help reduce symptoms so you can function in your life. Therapy and life style changes are long term, in that you learn about yourself, take control over your life, adopt positive coping mechanisms, and drop bad habits. If you don't do these things, then medication won't really ""cure"" you. 

You are doing a lot of these things already though. Having a good work-life balance is absolutely necessary. Exercise does wonders for everyone, especially those with depression. I would imagine that exercise is a coping mechanism and stress reliever for you, so if you don't do so for a few days, all that stress builds up in you and overwhelms you. 

I can't speak for other people, but I exercise consistently and fairly intensely, and i rely a lot on it as well to feel better physically and mentally. But I think it's always good to have multiple ways of relaxing and unwinding. I've practiced mediation in the past, I also enjoy drawing and playing music. They help me cope with emotions as well. 

So I would suggest trying medication, you can always go off it if you don't like it, but I think it's worth finding out if you do. I don't know if more exercise would benefit you, especially if you already exercise regularly and at a good intensity. High stress is always a major impact on quality of life, so I imagine your phd work has a greater influence than slight lack of exercise. But I can't say for certain.

I think it's important to do things proactively. Do things you want to be doing, and know why you are doing them. If you have a life you are passionate about, then waking up, going to work, and earning money isn't something you HAVE to do, but something you WANT to do. That change in mindset makes a huge difference in making us feel like we're in control of things. 

You mention becoming a police officer. I think its very important, especially in that field, to know why you want to become one, how you plan on being a good one, and what you expect to come from your career. It's a lot of planning and thinking, but its necessary to take hold of our lives so we aren't just floating through things and being pushed around by our environments.

These types of things would also help with confidence and self esteem. Feeling good about yourself is only partly physical. It also involves how you act and think. So if you are proud of what you are doing, and enjoy the things you do, then you will feel better about yourself and your future. 

Try not to push people away. Even if you are emotional and withdrawn, if you communicate those things to people you care about, and who care about you, they will be patient and supportive. If not, then they aren't people you want in your life to begin with. It's impossible to go through life without hurting, disappointing, or annoying/angering other people. But we can learn from those mistakes to make us a better person. Don't let fear stand in the way of growth.

You can make it through this. Think about what kind of man you want to be, and set goals that will push you in that direction. Maybe it's become a police officer. Maybe it's saving up money so you can move out. Maybe it's making some friends and having someone to talk to and hang out with after work. Focus on productive things.

You got this.

My advice would be to go to a professional to get evaluated, mental health is just like regular health, if you start throwing up every day you would go to the doctor, feeling the way you do constantly is essentially the same thing.

Sadly in a lot of places mental health professionals and their practices can sometimes be a little iffy but that's still the best option. If you do have an illness then to get cured you need a diagnosis first, as simple as that.

That being said not being ""happy"" all the time doesn't necessarily mean you have some mental illness, you know we human beings are complicated and sadness is as much of a valid emotion as any other, maybe your life is lacking a little something, maybe you need to try to find new friends or new engaging activities.

Having a marriage evolve into a mostly co-parenting relationship must be difficult. Even if everything in someone‚Äôs life were squared away, like even if there‚Äôre no money worries or health problems, kids are a lot of work. It‚Äôs exhausting and it‚Äôs natural to put their needs ahead of your own. When you add to the basic being there for the kid every day (you know the bits of energy that go into everything from helping them stay clean and fed to making sure their school work is squared away), when you add to that being depressed and feeling stress at work ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs incredibly hard.

Defining your marriage might be something you explore in therapy, or not. Maybe your personal recovery is separate from your relationship. It sounds like you‚Äôre on different pages with regard to parenting style and finances. These are huge areas that probably need to be addressed to get the most out of your relationship. Some of the differences might be misperceptions that can get brought into alignment with better communications. Other differences you might be able to learn to live with or each make changes. People want recognition for the good they do in the context of a relationship. Family/couples therapy could be a vehicle for getting clearer communication, but it‚Äôs easy for me to sit here and suggest that.

You see, everything we witness in day to day life is a product of mental construction.
If it were not so, then optical illusions and hallucinations would not be possible.

Equally, dreams are a product of mental construction, and the waking world and the dream world cross over in certain areas. 

I don't know if there is a truly real world, but what we see is not necessarily the full picture. Although it could be.


You don't have to be in control, in fact, I'm pretty sure that trying to control the mind makes it more erratic and anxious.
Your mind is already going to focus on her, so you don't need to do anything more. 
If you can, and I know it'll be difficult, I want you to just let your mind roam freely. Try not to hold it back or fight with it. ( It's ok if you do, it'll just take longer. )

And so when you are going to sleep, you might find that images flash through your mind, and maybe certain sounds etc... 
The goal is to let this process happen.
You don't have to pay attention to it, and you don't have to avoid it either.
(The mind can heal itself if it has the space to.)

What happens next is that the hypnogogic imagery will become more and more vivid until it seems solid and real. 
Usually this causes you to forget that you are sleeping and you'll fall into the dream world.

While that takes place the body undergoes sleep paralysis to prevent you from moving while asleep.

However, it is possible to stay conscious of this process if you are expecting it. However, I haven't been able to master it, though recently I've been trying something promising.

If you really are interested in lucid dreaming there's lots of books and resources on it.
I can provide links, although Google can provide most of them too.

At her wedding this past September (which I had an ugly depressive episode going on for the whole weekend) she actually made a house rule of only positive thoughts. 

She has tried to get me to stop taking all my medications (even ones that are non psychoactive like blood pressure) because she thinks they are making it worse.

I now recognize she wasn‚Äôt as good of a friend as I thought, but when you are of the state of mind as I am any friendship seems to be worth clinging to. Especially one you trusted for 10 years. 

When I sat down with her while we were on a trip together last October, is when the cracks became too big to repair. I shared something extremely personal to her which highly contributed to my anxiety and depression and I guess it freaked her out enough that she stopped speaking to me the next day. We were on a trip to S. America and I just totally crashed. Luckily it was at the end of the trip and I just had to make it home. I‚Äôve only heard from her once since then.

You can feel a little bit intellectualy down when you have a new treatement or if you suddenly stop taking one that your body is used to. 
Or some meds like anxyolitics/neuroleptics can slow you while you are under them.
But it never last more than a month or two in some cases.

1) Depression does slow you in a physical and psychical way. It does makes you less performant. So it could come from that. 

2) Maybe as you feel ""dumber"" than before, you're experiencing some self-confidence issues. Which leads you into unconsciously acting a little bit in a dumb way.

3) You're not telling us everything, like taking a drug recently that can fuck you over for some times.

Either way, you're a beautiful human being. You're smart, intelligence isn't about the grades. It's about a lot of different things.

It took me two different medications to find one that worked for me where I was comfortable with how it made me feel and the side-effects.  Other people get it right on the first try, some people have to try 3 or 5 different ones over the course of a year or longer.

There will definitely / likely be an adjustment period, followed by (hopefully) a gradual recovery until you hit some plateau.  What I noticed was that every month, I'd look back at the previous month and think ""wow, I'm feeling *so* much better"".  Then the next month would come and I'd look back again and think ""wow, I feel *so* much better"".

Basically, I had lost the sense of what it was to feel okay.  And that monthly resetting of expectations on ""what is feeling okay like"" continued for almost a year.

I still didn't like that particular medication and stopped it after 15-18 months.

A companion doesn't make my brains not screwed up. It just gives me someone to enjoy the good days with. And while one might say that I'm a burden to him on the bad days, staying with me is his choice.

This is an aspect of depression that you truly don't get. Rocket science is math. Here we're dealing with the psyche. Depression is an emotional/rational imbalance with or without a chemical imbalance. If someone is lonely, then by definition they are not their own friend.  If they could fix that with their current toolset they would have. 

I put this in another comment: 

Loneliness is awful, the worse you feel, the less likable you feel, and the less you want to interact, making you beat yourself up for not doing something to change your life, and disliking yourself more... it's a vicious circle.   

&amp;#x200B;

When you're depressed and don't like yourself, deciding to like yourself would be easy if it was math. We know a hell of a lot more about rocket science than we do about the brain and psyche.

Sex is and is not mechanical. It's nuanced and bold, personal, intimate, and fulfilling; when given the right emotions and environment, with people who share the same values and direction in life that you do.

Im sorry that wasn't what it was for you, the individual you were with should have been more aware. Don't let this situation be a shameful one, however. Use it as recognition that you require an emotional connection with someone to be both sexually and emotionally fulfilled, and remember that the future person you will come to love and treasure will want the same thing from you, and to not be derelict in your duties to their emotional well being, and they will not neglect theirs to you.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of her having something else going on, I've felt the same way for the past couple of weeks but if there is something, she doesn't want to tell me about it. She insists it's a simple case of not wanting to plan a future with someone that's negative all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

She's gone for a couple days now and I've started cleaning a bunch of things in preparation for my move out on Saturday. I took the sheets and towels into the bedroom where they always go and noticed she'd put a small piece of cardboard on top of the door -- presumably as a test to see if I went in the room while she's away.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no clue where this paranoia is coming from but it's super weird. She also messaged me a few hours after I posted this to, once again, remind me to be out by a specific time on Saturday. Just as she's been doing daily for a while now. What a great way to make me feel like even more of a piece of shit than to keep reiterating that  she'd rather me sleep in my car than here on the couch. And not just a vague preference but so insistent that she has to remind me at least once /day, often more.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly I'm feeling very scared right now. I don't know what's going on with her or why she's being like this. I don't know what the new apartment is going to be like, I don't feel secure in my new job since I've only been there a couple weeks and I've lost the one person I could really count on in this part of the world. Not only are we not together but she seems to have some kind of major trust issue with me for some reason. Whether she thinks she knows something or it's other things being projected onto me I just don't know. Maybe there's something in that room she's scared of me seeing but I've had nothing to hide up to this point and I'm not about to add a bad conscience to my list of problems so I guess I'll never find out.

&amp;#x200B;

That would make sense as to why she was screaming at me to get out before she left today. I just don't know. She's always been a kind, caring and supportive person who would go out of her way to help anyone. To desperately want me sleeping in the car even though she's not even here is the complete opposite of the person I knew.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the anxiety of all of this is what's limiting me to 1 meal /day. I just feel sick to my stomach, not knowing what my life will be like 1 month from now. Will I be sleeping on the streets, jobless with no way to leave the country? Is she going to explode in the coming weeks and unearth some weird shit that I'm now implicated in? I just don't know. Nothing is stable, nothing makes sense and I have nobody nearby that I can talk to.

&amp;#x200B;

In these days, especially in the USA we have to be out own advocate. We need to insist our PCP (primary car giver) take our complaints seriously or find someone else. Choice may be limited, but take what your can.

What is so hard is that if your are depressed your feel hopeless and helpless. Try to hold on to the fact that no matter how you feel that is not the case. Look for and take advantage of any local support groups and resources.

Oh no. It's back.

I didn't know what to do for a couple of week. I kept telling myself I was going to try to get better on my own this time instead of waiting helplessly for it to go away. But I didn't really do anything about it.

Until 2 days ago. I bought myself a new face wash and moisturizer. That night, I took a really long hot shower and thoroughly washed up. I touched up my hair (it's dyed but the dye was fading). Used my new face wash. Used my fancy moisturizer. Brushed my hair. Brushed my teeth, flossed, and used mouth wash. Got into clean pjs and got in bed.

I felt SO accomplished. I felt so good about myself and hopeful that I could get better.

The next day was hard but I reached out to a friend to try and force myself to socialize instead of isolate. That felt good too.

So now I'm skating off of these small victories and trying to create a snow ball effect to accomplish more and more.

I know it feels overwhelming and like you're moving a mountain. But start small. I promise you'll get there.

Important things during depression:

Hygiene, socializing, exercising, and healthy eating

Pick one small thing from those categories and try to stick with it. For me it's brushing my teeth every day (something I struggle with).

Some days I'm able to do a lot and I feel really good. Other days all I can manage is to brush my teeth. But, hey, I brushed my teeth. That's a win in my book.

The childhoodtrauma, was sexual abuse by the way, not phsyically but mentally, and i just define myself somehow by that.. i know i shouldnt and shit but i just didnt remembered all of it, like its just the way i deal with problems, i just fking distract myself and dont waste time on them, but ive never thought that i actually could be so hurt by something that i entirely forget it.

I actually am in states where i feel like i dont have any emotion at all, i dont wanna digress too much, but we had a cat, for damn(yeah u right not fking) 18 years, and i loved that fat eating machine god.. but i actually didnt like cry one tear, i just didnt deal with it, my mother was like crying crazy for atleast 1 week and i just seemed like i did not care, and i cant actually tell u if i did.

The twist is, i know for sure that as a kid, i felt emotions (atleast thats the perception im having right now) atleast twice as much as ""normal"" (who the fuck is normal these days can actually someone tell me ? there are like one billion disorders, we all sick arent we ? so why are we still expecting... sorry, i need to stay with my subject AH.) Like children are innocent most of the times anyways, so dont wanna glorify myself but idk... If i just go back to the days I was like 4-6 years old god.. I was like the truest true boi in the hood, like i couldnt fake shit i always said what i thought, to everyone and anyone, and i did never felt bad about it, not one inch (ofc maybe every child does that, but i never intended to change, but maybe thats just how it is for everyone)...

When im now looking at me in my mind, i could like fking start crying cus i feel so sorry for that little boy, like all that shit that happend, im not mad at any of these people, i cant even get mad at anyone idk why, i remember when i got treated unfairly, like really unfair i was like ""fuck this shit im not going to talk to my mother the next week"" and after 30 mins i fking forgot what all of this was even about, i just had no time to be angry at anyone, and i still have but why do i feel like shit now ?

I just dont wanna make excuses, because thats what it always seems like to other people.. and now i dont even know what the heck my brain thinks, like am i really making excuses cus im just a lazy fuck ? actually i always was so motivated and happy but its fucking frustating as .... if people just tell u that u are not, like why the fuck does someone else tell me how things are for ME ? and thats the worst, the second u start saying ""well its for me that way"" the opposite site has no arguments left. And thats what kinda leads to an addictionf or me, where i can always justify ANYTHING (skipping work, just bad decisions in general which i might have even known that they are bad).

The thing about the Trauma is, i mean i know i got emotionally abused, and i also know that this kinda got up some second character in me, like the bad version of myself.. The Version thats like ""manipulating people is cool, thats how u show real  superiority"" like fuck no bad Version what the heck is wrong with u just cut it, and please let me be happy somehow ??????

I was ""most"" of my childhood like alone, in the Internet, my first relationship was with some  pedophile dude.. i mean i was 11, i wanted a voicemail where he/she should say that she loves me (wanted to hear the girly voice just to be sure before we meet on  playground, and when my mouther found out cus i left the PC on holy shit, that were some feelings, idk but i blamed it on myself god that feeling was really nasty i thought i died in terms of stomach pain lol :D shame is a really shitty feeling.. but yeah thats another story i guess...

Acutally. Am i doing something illegal here ? this Post is getting out of hand, but ill post it anyways, im sorry already for not reading the Rules, cus heck I know already that my focus wont maintain long enough to read them entirely and what scares me even more is that i have to read my own post AFTER reading the Rules and correct and... Thank you for the attention well.. see ya

Now i feel selfish cus this kinda just got into ""i want to represent myself"" post, but actually i just wanted to deliver u atleast some story how im feeling right now just as i  mentioned at the beginning, like there might be a chance this helps u somehow, even if like reading this post thorugh is so disturbing and disgusting i mean distracting that your thoughts are like gone for sometime, fuck derek.

Okay thats really it see ya guys.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: that i hate self pity now kinda sounds like joke, doesnt it ? why am i overthinking, can please someone tell me ? Ofcourse its insecurity, but no one ever could fking tell me how to change it apart from doing sports, and i really want to but... nvm i really need to sleep now, first appointment with an psychiatrist today in like.. fuck some hours and ive been wake for like .. oof",,1573788400,{},f7jwmt2,False,t3_cml6ni,False,True,t1_f7jwm0j,/r/depression/comments/cml6ni/regular_checkin_post/f7jwmt2/,1573788401,1,True,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],
[],,slayes,,,[],,,,text,t2_22xvrukw,False,,[],"Actually i kinda feel the same, im just like at an earlier stage.Childhood Trauma kicked in while work being absolutely stressfull, people always expect such unrealistic things from me i just cant deliver. I mean maybe its cus of my ADHD somehow that people just never get me, it just feels so heavy, that I try to let people understand how i feel and how things are for me(because usually i tend to  see things just completely different than other people, and its fucking frustrating when no one believes you, like everyone is like yeah ure just undiciplined, like I just dont want to do those things or every mistake (in their conception) I make is on Purpose)

My biggest problem is that i fucking hate self pity, and like talking about it is even harder.. Somehow it just disgusts me, like normally im somewhat a positive person but if something does not goes as i planned it to (or expected it from myself, \*high expectations\*) i fking feel like falling down twice as much with my face rubbing the floor forth and back (i dont even know whats that supposed to mean).

Im kinda sorry for just replying with my story, but maybe ull feel the connection, I just felt like it i dont know honestly, i mean actually i just want to appretiate ur Post, cus its so fking big and no one actually replied till now(and I dont have like advice or anything to share that might help you, so ill just try to idk give u some attention or whatever im talking about, i think the structure in this post is the worst ever) i mean quanitity is not quality maybe but i just appreciated the post in general I think.

Now i kinda lost the point what i was even talking about, writing all of that may not be that usefull tho, but as im writing im also thinking like why the fuck am i doubting any shit im doing. Like having no trust in urself kinda sucks right ? I mean i cant even tell if I can make it to Dinner on Saturday with my Girlfriend even tho i told her ill fking organize that shit(i gotta stop say fking im sorry) like deciding which restaurant and stuff.. but it just happens like 8/10 times that im like ""yeah i wann go"" or ""yeah lets meet tomorrow"" and then when the day comes im like .. dafuq u mean i wont go anywhere.. -&gt; just sit here and keep playing video games, worst part of it - if im perfoming poorly i get pissed at myself really hard, but i still just grind that shit mindlessly till i fking feel nothing, i dont know if I mentioned that i ""quit"" work. Someone will probably DDos me for that unstructured - unformatted piece of shit post but hey self doubt HOW THE FUCK ARE U DOING GO AWAY.

Right now im like still getting money, easy life cus i also saved some money in the bank.. but i just dont have any desire, i mean actually what is this society about, feels like

adults : ur work contract says work 8 hours a day -&gt; if u wanna achieve anything in life u gotta work 12im like: isnt society in that ""shitty condition"" cus everyone is like ""i only care about the money i earn, later onimma fking drive 3 lamborghinis, have 20 kids and a villa""

disclaimer: I didnt meant that entirely serious.. but sometimes its very easy to make everything feel unworthy especially urself no? like if u dont have anything to achieve what the fuck are u doing here, what am i doing here ? i just dont have any energy left for going like outside and pretending (like i did my whole life long) that everything is just fking fine and i just have to keep thinking positive. like: Find ur true Purpose ! why do i even have to fking find it, while trying to be something i actually am not ?

i cant imagine how long it will take till i find like someone who employs me and is like"" reliablility? we fucking pay u for chilling ur balls m8, just come and leave whenever u want""cus this aint ever happening right ? like what the fuck am i even thinking. My brain tells me like ""dude its not all it's not all sunshine and roses"", but i just wanna write that whiny shit down, i hope im not offending someone im someway i just dont know what im doing. But i still feel better, even if this posts gets deleted cus i suddenly stopped writing like a normal person but i just cant keep track of all the :

""i's"" which should actually be ""I's"" and ""U's"" or  ""u's"" for you and.. ok this is pointless, if some read till down here, you can atleast be sure of that ADHD is nothing of your concern, because im sure i lost all my bois on the way.

But even though I often struggle with myself and my past so much, I have no idea how differently I‚Äôd feel if I had chosen different paths. So many of the stupid, risky, self-conscious decisions that caused me pain led me here and now. I think I could be an entirely different person and still not be happy with myself ‚Äî but in the past year or so, simply recognizing that makes me happier with myself. Accepting where I‚Äôve been and where I am, and looking forward to what COULD be if I hang on to myself above everything else, seems to make every day a little easier. Just three months ago, I never thought I‚Äôd feel as steady as I feel today. 

I think you have to hold on tight, and you have to try bask in the happy moments/minutes/hours/days/weeks ... do something nice for yourself. Whenever you feel even just a bit up for it, do something, anything, nice for yourself. It took me years to feel okay being nice to me. Letting go of things I can‚Äôt control any longer and accepting that they are a part of me (not a ‚ÄúBAD‚Äù part, but  just a part) has lifted a lot of weight off of my shoulders. After spending so long feeling like I deserved that weight, I don‚Äôt want to turn back the clock. All of the awfulness helped me to be more mindful and to appreciate being able to experience happiness more fully.

I know I‚Äôll still wonder about your question forever, but I try as hard as I can (and sometimes I fail) to wake up and decide not to bury myself in what could have been. The days when I succeed are really, really good days. Those days make everything else worth it, but it definitely took a commitment to myself to make it to those days.

[],,Soshalyawk,,,[],,,,text,t2_2338n13y,False,False,[],"I'm not depressed but I love being alone. I LOVE being alone. I love going to the movies alone and to the library alone. I love picking out a good book or movie, grabbing popcorn from the mall and a face mask and coming home. Lighting a candle, setting up a movie or grabbing my book, popping some corn, grabbing an ice cold coke and relaxing with my book/movie. I love the solitude. I love being able to relax and dive into other worlds. 

I believe I have social anxiety. I don't connect well with other people - I can't be myself around others and am always on high alert, trying not to offend or thinking of what I should say next. It's too draining. Be alone with only myself is beautiful to me and I love every opportunity I get to be alone. 

Last year I got to move out of my house for a year for school. I'm 21 (currently live at home as my university is 10 minutes from my family home) - but last year, when I did a year at a nearby school - it was the most amazing time of my life. I always called my parents at night and talked to my siblings, but being alone and having all that time during the day for myself was brilliant. I can't wait for the future. Traveling solo - living solo - just, it sounds beautiful to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have a different perspective on the whole thing. Having people in your life is an ideal in the media. Some people say that being alone is bad for you - and I get that social isolation is bad - but I also have a part time job, so I do talk to hundreds of people a day - so I have some social interaction throughout the week. But overall, I love my alone time and you shouldn't feel so bad about it. Make it the best. Make the most of it and have some fun. Do what you love. 

Hey - go get a face mask (IDFC if your a guy or a girl, just get it), grab a tub of your favourite food, put on a fantastic movie (I recommend Three idiots (it's a brilliant A+++++++ a movie and it's on Netflix) and a nice, subtle candle. Set it all up and just relax. You deserve a night off.

Think about OCD.  How many times have you seen, ""I have OCD! #ocd"" on social media when someone has just done some basic, everyday cleaning or if they are a habitual neatnik. Genine clinical OCD is actually a debilitating disease, not a personality quirk.  Not something funny and inconsequential.  This colloquial misuse creates a misunderstanding of OCD as an actual disease among the general public.  

Likewise, when people say they are ""depressed"", most who hear this link the term up with all the other people claiming to be ""depressed"" and who are genuinely not experiencing features of the actual mental disorder.  Breakup?  ""Depressed."" Don't like your job? ""Depressed.""  Bad hair day? ""Depressed.""

also, i cannot STAND looking at people more attractive than me. i‚Äôm either borderline hostile or can‚Äôt hold a normal conversation because i don‚Äôt know what to do with myself besides stare at them in envy. i even tend to gravitate towards crushes on conventionally unattractive people so that I feel less threatened or to be sure that *im* the one out of *their* league.

i think my more passive version of self harm or moving up my appointment with the grim reaper is not brushing my teeth for so long that i had to get at least 8 root canals and fillings ( i‚Äôve lost count by this point) and infecting my throat with that bacteria, not eating or drinking more than a snack for days, sitting in direct sunlight for hours without sunscreen...

Not sure if that's why he stopped hanging out with me. Sometime passed, I contacted him again. I had read books on how to make friends. The 1 rule, is to be positive no matter what.

So I hit him up, hanged out. This time I tried not to complain about anything (it can slip)
I try focusing only on the present not about tomorow or yesterday, just the moment. 


I tried smiling a little just to hide the emptiness. We also laughed a lot, I felt I was somewhat convincing as I didn't want to let him know I was a loser with no job.

,,wayfarer_jr,,,[],,,,text,t2_1f8d801l,,,,"Regardless of how much research and study has been done, there‚Äôs one thing that depression is not, and that is well-understood. 

Efficacy of most treatments are typically pretty low, like maybe in the 30s, for the more established ones. Electroconvulsive therapy has a higher rate of efficacy, something like 80%, but that still leaves 20% of patients it doesn‚Äôt work for. I‚Äôm in the respective 70 and 20 percent clusters. I have treatment resistant depression, which is something that there, really, is an absurdly low level of data about. It‚Äôs an area of depression that most people in the mental health profession seem to want to ignore. A few weeks ago, my therapist referred to my case as being atypical in that there has been exactly zero positive response to any of the rather long list of treatments I‚Äôve tried. 

Basically, even with many of the available treatments, they don‚Äôt actually know -why- something works. SSRIs, for instance, are effective for some people, but the mental health profession doesn‚Äôt understand why. There are different theories, but none of them are remotely conclusive. Most of mental health treatments are more just a thing of throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks. Some people are very fortunate that one of the first things they try works for them. 

Electroconvulsive therapy has been around for decades and decades, since the 1930s I believe, and, even before the treatment was electrical, it was chemical and dates back centuries. They still don‚Äôt understand why that works either. They just have guesses. All they know is that the goal is to trigger a grand mal seizure and that, for some people, it can reduce their symptoms. It came about because it was observed that people with epileptic seizures didn‚Äôt demonstrate any instances of certain mental illnesses like schizophrenia, so, true to medical form, the logic was to give people seizures. It seems barbaric, but it does actually work for a lot of people, so, whatever. It‚Äôs not pleasant though, apart from the drugs and pure oxygen they gave me to knock me out before zapping my head. 

Then, there‚Äôs the reality that depression can be triggered by different factors. It could be a physical genetic issue in the brain. It could be an inflammatory disorder. It could be situational. It could be a head trauma, even a mild one. And, then there are the ways they‚Äôre finding that the brain evolves over time, making treatment, potentially, even more difficult. Like, certain regions become overactive and others under-active. Metabolic disorders or other hormonal issues ... The list goes on. And, what about comorbidities? 

It‚Äôs not so simple as many think. 

That doesn‚Äôt mean that people cannot or should not try, I just know that, for many, the fact that they‚Äôre still alive is proof of them still trying. And, even if someone chooses to commit suicide, I sympathize.",,1533872611,,e3xidlg,False,t3_962qh6,,True,t1_e3xgn7g,/r/depression/comments/962qh6/what_makes_one_person_motivated_to_seek_help_and/e3xidlg/,1537314418,2,True,False,depression,t5_2qqqf,,,,1527010427.0,True,False,,0.0,,0.0,,3.0,1834.0,r/depression,public,,,,,

I think it all started that he didn‚Äôt like the vacation I planned for dumb reasons and he was really mean to me about it. So I then got upset and told him what an ass he was, then he thought I was in the wrong and needed to apologize. So when I got home from work (12 hour work day) and said I had nothing to apologize for he got really mad. He was yelling and ranting and raving and I said fuck this I‚Äôm going to bed. That‚Äôs when he followed me upstairs and broke his guitar. When I came down to throw all the pieces out and get a broom for the splinters, he was just hurling wedding pictures across the living room one after another. Dog hiding in the corner, glass everywhere. Then I cleaned that (apparently not well enough) and then he starts crying in bed and acting like the victim. At that moment I felt like a predator that had just injured it‚Äôs prey (all my tears dried right up) and I just let him have it about everything he does that‚Äôs fucked up. I wanted him to know what an asshole he is and how he makes me feel. He kept begging me to stop but I wouldn‚Äôt. And really all I did was read him his OWN texts to me insulting me. So yeah he got upset bc of his own words. What an absurd situation.  It‚Äôs been a while since he‚Äôs been that bad.  He‚Äôs usually just a garden variety verbally abusive asshole most days, but every 6 months or so he really loses it like this. It‚Äôs been over a year since he laid a hand on me, and I think he‚Äôs learned his lesson on that one since the neighbors called the cops on him. 

Family lives far away. Friends don‚Äôt understand and are married with lives of their own, and none are good friends anyways. I‚Äôm kind of out on my own here. The thing about my husband is that he can control himself. I know he can and I‚Äôve seen it- like when the cops came he went from raging lunatic to kind and calm and rational in seconds like ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm so sorry you had to come all the way here for no reason.‚Äù He is too narcissistic to let anything happen to himself by hitting me and leaving a mark.

Bullshit. You can ask for help if you feel you need it. Depression is the nastiest fucking disease on this planet because the suffers get to walk around fine while they die slowly in their own minds.

Added advantage, you find out real quick who your real friends are and who is just hanging around. Just know what you need and what you want your friends to do. I'll guarantee they'll be more scared than you if you go to them with this, but provided you have a plan (ie. take me to therapy. wake me up every morning. take me to the gym 3x a week. go for a walk everyday) then they'll be able to do it.

As to caring too much and wanting to message them all the time, I think it's important to realise that ultimately they are not your responsibility and you can't help them all the way through. Recognise that you can't save everyone.

I drop out of college, move back to live with my parents and I got a job, it was crapy, but at least it was something. After years of therapy, hard work, try to be more social, try to get back on my track. I made a recovery and I meet my now ex-girlfriend.

We have a great time, I told her everything about me, my mental problems, my insecurities and she even said that she loved me more for telling her and for my bravery on my walk. Last summer I decided to go back to college and finish my degree, after 4 years. Things started to get me, a lot a stress, is hard to go back and have a study rhythm. First I start to lose motivation, then I got depressed again because I couldn't keep up. My girlfriend said that she would be there matter what. But as you, one day she said that she was sick of my crap, I wasn't try hard, I wasn't good enough. I have to admit my heart was broken, still is, and like you, I doubt about everything and my self lowering though came back. 

Despite all,  we need to keep on fighting, try to hold on the people that really care for you, not the ones that leave you when you need them most.

It seems like you took the time to be the strong person in your relationship, and she made it pretty clear in the moment that she couldn't reciprocate. That being said, you deserve treatment if you want it, so let me throw some suggestions your way that I've learned from working as a clinician and in my own treatment:

1. Look up your state laws on consenting to therapy, as you may actually be able to get some treatment independently. While you probably couldn't get medication without parental approval, you may be able to start talk therapy.

1. Bring up your symptoms with doctors/school counselors who you think could advocate for you. I've worked with parents that didn't believe their kids had a mental illness, but were willing to let them get treatment because other healthcare professionals pushed them to do so. 

1. If you feel like you're in serious danger of hurting or killing yourself **tell a teacher, doctor, counselor, etc.** All of these individuals are legally mandated in most states to help get you treatment if you're in danger, and your health can override parental wishes. Do note that you might have to briefly go to the hospital or an inpatient program, but a few days there is way better than ending up badly hurt.

Anyhow, let me know if you have any questions, I would be glad to help however I can. Good luck in getting treatment!

,,RinTheWanderer,,,[],,,,text,t2_ndjgx,,,,"I had a girlfriend that was suicidally depressed for about a year. It was terrifying. Everyone experiences depression differently so I can only relate my own experiences. i don't think anyone can really be saved from depression by someone else. It's something you have to save yourself from. Try your best not to get into the mindset that you have to save her from herself, even if sometimes you really do have to do that. If you do directly interfere, you are buying her time to save herself, thats it.

Try not to make her feel like a burden. Often times guilt is the biggest issue so you don't want to give them any cause to feel guilty on your behalf. 

Depressed people aren't stupid, they can tell if you are just patronizing them (and they will probably think you are even if you aren't). Don't walk on eggshells around them so to speak. Just be yourself, be happy, and be around them.

Also, if they aren't averse to it, a hug goes a realllllly long way sometimes. Even if it's kind of embarrassing. Actually especially if its embarrassing. Depression twists your thoughts but the warmth of another person practically pierces through all that dark mental haze. Just you know, make sure they are ok with a hug.

Other than that be forgiving and understanding. They will probably try to push you away. They will try to hurt you (emotionally) when they do it. Just be strong and let them tire themselves out trying, then forgive them and smile. 

Logic is virtually useless against depression. You can try if you want but depression doesn't really care about that so don't expect to be able to reason them out of some utterly nonsensical depressed thought. You aren't there to provide solutions most of the time, just to hear them out, to feel what they feel, and to be strong enough to be ok sharing in those dark feelings with them.

Still, I'm just one guy with limited experience, you should probably do some research if you are serious about helping your friend.

Empty promises die in more valued glass
The damaged heart just hurts in other ways
Romantic dreams are not reality, no softened fur
No cottage dreams... just interruptions of words
And listening ignored

And help is none, too many challenges
too many ultimatums from unsupportive blood
So alone I cry, trapped inside the bottle that is not mine

As an aside, and I apologize if it comes off as condescending, but be careful with the drinking. Alcohol can make depression worse, and bumps up risk for suicide. We don't want to lose you.

Until 16 I just dismissed my problem as having bad days or being weak in general. Am turning 30 this summer and I can't exactly remember if I was ever ""normal"" as people like to say.
