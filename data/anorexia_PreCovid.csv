Not a magic bullet but some helpful ideas about observing urges but not acting on them. It was one of a number of things that kicked off a year b/p free. I’m currently trying to overcome a relapse and am thinking about revisiting the book.
Like most of us I find helpful solutions through a combination of recovery sources... not  just one book or person or method.

Here’s a podcast with the author that turned me onto the book, might be worth a listen:

The host is Polly Mertens who has a great Website called www.getbusythriving.com. She overcame 20 years of bulimia and has been a source of hope in my dark times.

Josephinejager,1523266650.0,,,,t2_15zo4x1t,"Hey there. Bulimia is a serious condition that can worsen over time if not treated properly. I’ve struggled with it for more than a decade. 
So I applaud you for reaching out even though you are afraid you will not be taken seriously by your family.
The website www.bulimiahelp.org is a good place to go to get more info on recovery and how to stop the binge/purge cycle. They have some inspiring success stories.
Also there are online meetings for Anorexics and Bulimics Anonymous www.aba12steps.org. Just attending and feeling like you’re not alone can help a lot.
It might help to seek counseling/therapy for your condition.
The sooner you begin to approach recovery, the better. Hopefully you will receive the support you need from loved ones as they get more educated about eating disorders.
You are very brave for wanting to take the first steps to recovery, and you are not alone.

This isn’t uncommon in the recovery process. I hate to say it, but the only way to get past this part is to keep challenging yourself. The stomach has to relearn how to work properly again, and the only way it can is through nourishing yourself.

If you can’t stomach solid food to get all of your meals/snacks in, you could also try liquid supplements like Ensure or Boost. Not a long-term solution, but it could at least get you some nutrition in the meantime.

If you don’t already, I would strongly encourage working with a dietitian to set up a meal plan, and maybe you could bounce ideas off her/him to try.

Recovery takes trial and error, and A LOT of patience. It can be very frustrating feeling like you cannot help her, but ultimately she is the one who has to do the heavy lifting and you have to be the one who will believe she can do it.

sommefeils,1474599654.0,,,,t2_11lq9c,"Hello, welcome to the sub. 

I don't think the reason matters. Whether or not it is 'just' an outward expression of your depression, it's still a really unhealthy coping mechanism that will slowly but surely damage your body and mind over the years. 

I have been suffering from bulimia for about 5+ years now, and I pretty much just live with it. I hope to stop one day, but I'm not sure I can do it without professional health and since I'm able to  function 'normally' despite the E.D. I've sort of given up trying. I go to work, spend time with family and friends, Netflix, B/P, sleep, repeat.

But my advice is: don't be stupid like me! I'm not sure if you're seeking help for your depression yet, but please also mention your bulimia. It doesn't matter how or why this habit formed. You have an eating disorder and you should seek professional treatment/support if you can. Everybody deserves to feel as healthy and secure in their own body and mind as possible, and that includes you. Even though I am able to live with it, bulimia is such a drain on money, time, and energy. I can't tell you the $ amount I've wasted on food over the years and all of the nights I've spent binging and hunching over a toilet instead of doing something good with my time. It's like being a functioning alcoholic, except most people probably understand alcoholism more than bulimia.

I’ve sometimes gone 1.5-2 years without purging, and the bingeing definitely receded over time and  everything just got more natural and intuitive.

Unfortunately I’d always slip up and do a “minor purge” before the two year mark. And that “minor purge” always led to a huuuge relapse.

So you are doing really hard, tough work by not purging and I have no doubt the bingeing will gradually stabilize for you.

My hunch to get it back is to make it your mission and refuse to give up on yourself!! 6 months is a HUGE accomplishment and you deserve to feel very proud of - and inspired by - that!! If you can do 6 months you can do it again, and for even longer. You can! You have it in you! Be gentle with yourself, this is a journey, and don't undermine how far youve already come!!

I'm 33 and in very early bulimia recovery after 20 horrible years of being a SLAVE to it. I would love to be able to say I've made it 6 months!!!! The longest I've gone is 6 weeks, and currently I'm on day 3 again after having gone 11 days. Its so, so hard. But! I won't give up, and I hope you don't either. Trust me, it does NOT just go away on its own... I wish so SO SO SO much I could go back and have recovered sooner. So many wasted years, so many good memories tainted, soooo much money thrown away on food, so many goals not reached. I'm committed to recovering for my future self- I don't want to be robbed of any more years. Its so sad, isn't it? You deserve a meaningful life,  and so do I!

Best of luck - do not give up on yourself!! I know it is so hard but the only one who can fight this fight is YOU. Its progress not perfection and you have progressed so far! Don't give up now! This can just be a minor stumble along the path to your recovery if you refuse to let yourself get stuck here.

Do you have support? Most effective recoveries involves a team of loved ones and professionals with whom you can be open  and honest. That could include counselors, dieticians, friends, family and support groups.

Trying to take it on alone can be burdensome &amp; lonely. .

I attend Anorexics &amp; Bulimics anonymous. Also sometimes Eating Disorders Anonymous.  They have online groups listed on their Website. I’m trying to attend one a day. 

Being able to link your recovery to others adds support, accountability and inspiration. These groups also encourage sponsorship (a kind of mentor who walks you through the 12 step program).  Also, support will be there if you hit a rough patch &amp; relapse into old habits (a common part of recovery).

One of the recent speakers at an ABA meeting shared that she has 7 years of “sobriety” with her anorexia. She’s still in the program because she feels it’s keeping her on track, and now she can help others.

Josephinejager,1523266650.0,,,,t2_15zo4x1t,"Hey thanks so much for sharing all this. I do not have a professional treatment team at this time. I did inpatient for bulimia when I was 23. It really helped at the time ... BUT once back in the real world I tried to maintain support groups, therapy, structured eating, etc. I relapsed anyways and sort of gave up on professional support. I had some progress with intuitive eating, maintaining spiritual well being and organic support of friends/family. I had some good stretches, 1 year here, 1.8 years there, etc. But I also began to steadily pick up drinking because it seemed to “help.”
Anyways fast forward to 2016 I was yet again 1 year bp free but alcohol got out of control and I had a full on psychological meltdown, ended up in psyche wards, jail for a DUI, then homeless. It still blows my mind because I was a pretty sane responsible person until all that. Everything just fell apart.
Anyways.....got into AA, got sober for 90, checked myself back in a psyche ward, relapsed on bulimia in the ward, relapsed on alcohol shortly after, attempted suicide, and .... randomly moved to BFE Idaho a few months ago.

Ugh it all sounds so crazy.

My current support is AA, Reddit, and some supportive mentors with experience in addiction and EDs that have stuck by me.

I did two online ABA (Anorexic and Bulimic Anonymous) meetings today just bc I need group support.  But ABA seems pretty rigid about only using their book &amp; philosophies etc.

I definitely get the toxic cycle of restrict/binge/purge. I’ve become a lot less obsessive about weight and numbers over the years ... but still can’t shake the cycle. 

Jeeeez that was long. Felt good to get it all out.

I’m moving to a bigger city in June hopefully so professional therapy will be more feasible.

Talking about ""big exercising"" - I'm so not ready for it yet. If I started it, it would be for the wrong reasons (forcing, demanding results, eventually failing unreasonable goals, leading to desperation and prolly a binge). Also, the heavier exercise one does, the more one has to eat, and sudden and huge hunger might also lead me to a shock - why do I crave so much food? Why do I need to eat so much when there are no results yet? 

The long walks are sustainable (lately the favorite word of mine - looking for everything that I know I can keep up even if I was e.g. really ill, pregnant, in a different country, with -20 degrees outside - I can still go to meetings and have walks).

FluffyWof,1400387867.0,,,,t2_gm1yr,"For me all my eating disorders have always been associated with my feelings about my body. The fatter I am, the more I B/P, and I know the only way I reduce that frequency is by losing weight. So I completely understand how you feel. I will therefore also get more anxious about the weight I’ve gained due to my binges and binge more. 

So, I will often take quick fix measures to lose weight and cull my disgust with myself so that I can stop binging so much. These measures include an hour of intense daily cardio and one very very measured meal at the very end of the day (of foods I don’t enjoy but are healthy eg boiled vegetables) so thatI won’t binge out of hunger, and I also won’t have started an entire day of binging. 

When I am happier with how I look, that’s how I know I’ll stop B/P so much. If it takes you a few sessions of relapse to get your weight down, so be it. It’ll be better for you in the long run. And what I say isn’t entirely wrong either, researchers have actually found that quick and drastic weight loss actually works better in many cases than slow weight loss, because the patients feel more confidence and pleasure from seeing such happy results.

Personally I found that getting rid of binge foods altogether helped reduce binges, or atleast made it so I was just binging on healthier food. I've also heard that planning your binges can help; So, for example, if you tend to b/p three times a day maybe try for one or two, and plan when and what you'll eat each time.  Maybe try to figure out what it is that drives you to binge (for me, once I had sort of worked through my ED thoughts, it was mainly routine and stress, so finding was to change my routine (finding something to do outside the house when I tended to binge) and other ways to deal with stress/anxiety made a really big difference). You could always look at the binge eating disorder sub for tips (I've never checked it out, but I imagine they might have a thing or two that could be helpful).

graamatvede,1396011760.0,,,,t2_fw1no,"Thank you all for responses! 

I decided to kick smoking first by reading the Alan Karr book (it would roughly take me 3 days and I wanted to quit smoking really badly)

Day 1 - Woke up, had a long walk. Binged/purged like hell (even though it said in the book not to use food, but fuck it, I have ED!)  Also noticed that my addiction to nicotine is similar to food - i procrastinate, postpone things just for another smoke or binge. I get nervous when the urge sets in. And generally I realized what INCREDIBLE POWER this addiction has over me, I was just bending to any its wish, eating what it told me, smoking when it told me, throwing up when it told me. I was a slave to the addictions. Took painkiller for the head. Sleeping pills and off to bed. Nightmares. I knew I could kick it. This is just symptoms of the chemicals leaving my body. I can.

Day 2 - Less b/p. Feel like drunk. Emotionally still feeling powerful, physically - dizzy and funny. Walks and walks again. Similes - smoking and b/p are triggered by boredom, loneliness, restlessness, sadness, anger. So I had to get out of the house. Biking around, nothing super physical, just anything to keep outside the apartment. Sleeping pills in the evening. Nightmares again. Cried and thought everyone hates me. Understanding I am acting as a drunk person and my mind is playing tricks on me.

Day 3 - first day at work. Still like funny drunk. Nicotine almost gone. Drinking so much water. No urge for binging either. Food doesnt solve my problems. Moving around also makes me recognize hunger - ACTUAL HUNGER! Earlier I could lay on the couch, tv, or move around in the car while having high calorie coffees/coca colas every day. Of course I didn't know what hunger was! My body was hardly spending any energy and I already took upon so much sugar and calories! I know I can beat this! I've already beaten nicotine and feel like a non smoker. Biking to a meeting in the evening and to pick up a book from a friend. Movement. Away from smokes, away from binding.

Secondly, take 2 deep breaths. You're not an idiot. :)

If you are concerned with your ex showing up to your wedding, tell your fiance (so the groomsmen can keep vigilant) or your brother (if you have any). They'd most likely be glad to put your ex out. Another option it to ask the venue if any security will be available. Last option: ask for your police for their presence at your reception/ceremony or maybe a restraining order.

Try not to let your ex ruin the day you've dremt of.

Feel free to disregard the next questions if its too personal- have you talked to your fiance about your b/p cycles and how this is stressing you out? He's gonna be your main emotional support for the rest of your life, so you should be comfortable talking about your deepest insecurities and not hide this from him. Even if he cant help, he should know what you're going through so he wont make it worse.

I'm also concerned that his past infidelity may be effecting your self esteem... I personally would not take the excuse of 'working a lot'. I'm assuming he loves you, and therefore, has time for you.

I don't agree that once a cheater,  always a cheater, but cheaters do lack respect of the other party (you) and its that would be a huge red flag if he doesnt 'have time for you', but can have an affair.

Bulimia isn't a short struggle, but remember that it gets easier once you're back on track.
The first goal I would set is to stop purging. It will be hard, but there are certain ways to make it easier for you, such as eating snacks before meals (at the start, unhealthy is fine as long as you stop purging). Also, try to not weigh yourself in and once you manage to stop purging you can begin to adjust what you eat to stop eating unhealthily (personally I found that I binge+purge the most at lunch so I cut most carbs out, so I could eat veggies and meats which would help as they made me feel fuller faster.)
In terms of self harm, I'm not too sure how to help since I'm struggling with it too, but I'm sure we can both heal over time, and remember that results won't be instantaneous.

WikiTextBot,1496576979.0,,,,t2_32duad4,"**Dialectical behavior therapy**

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a therapy designed to help people suffering from personality disorders. It has also been used to treat mood disorders as well as those who need to change patterns of behavior that are not helpful, such as self-harm, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. This approach works towards helping people increase their emotional and cognitive regulation by learning about the triggers that lead to reactive states and helping to assess which coping skills to apply in the sequence of events, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to help avoid undesired reactions. DBT assumes that people are doing their best but lack the skills needed to succeed, or are influenced by positive reinforcement or negative reinforcement that interferes with their ability to function appropriately.

tnew12,1419602867.0,,,,t2_kbtfr,"Hey everyone, thanks for reading my rant. I was able to talk to my bf last night about it. He's already aware of my ED. I'm sharing because I know someone else may be going through this too.

When I got out of bed I wanted to leave my house to clear my head... but I realized that I was running away from dealing with my issues. Sometimes when I try to speak about how I’m feeling, my emotions are too strong and a lump tightens in my throat... thus writing it out gets my point across better. Long story short, I shared this post with him.

The short term solution is that I asked him if he could share the details of his weight with a friend, and when talking to me say things like, 'I have more energy now' or 'I can fit into X Y Z now' instead of talking about exact numbers. 

I then told him that my thoughts are irrational, but we need to deal with them in a realistic way. He sees me as beautiful, whereas I see myself as the heaviest I've ever been. Clearly, I need to start giving myself more credit for the productive things I'm doing- filling my plate with half veggies to make sure I’m satisfied/full by the end of the meal and staying joyfully active (aka not punishing myself via workouts). I did 2 short walks (about 10-15 min each) yesterday and looking back, I’m happy that I got out of bed to do so. I also looked up some info on resilience that will help me the next time I feel like I’m going to be ‘knocked down’ emotionally.
http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/road-resilience.aspx

I also scheduled an appointment with my counselor. She’s a licensed social worker who helped me though recovery. I like her more than any shrink I’ve seen. After graduating from my outpatient DBT therapy in 2015, I’ve only been back to her about 2x a year. I’m going to make an effort to see her about 3-4x instead to make sure I’m held accountable and can refresh some of the skills I learned.

Debonaire_Death,1291589754.0,,,,t2_4l6lc,"For starters, you need nutrients. I would recommend a [greens powder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000F4H5UO/ref=twister_B00S793H9M?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1) on an *empty stomach* in the morning. Getting your nutrients will help you think more clearly about this, and you need to think clearly.

Second, you've got to be open with your parents about this. I know it's shameful, I've been there, but they love you. They can only help you if you're honest with them about this.

I would strongly recommend a [Vipassana meditation retreat](http://www.dhamma.org/en-US/locations/directory). They have them all over the place, and they are completely donation-based. They provide food and board, and you aren't allowed to have any food in your room, just during meal times in dining area.

I did it and it helped a lot. You just sit and pay attention to your feelings without judgment, and recognize that they're impermanent. It's a real trip but it also really helps you step back and look at yourself. You also get ultimate privacy because the whole retreat is done in ""Noble silence"", which means that not only do people not talk to you but they also avoid making eye contact. There are really inspirational recorded lectures played every evening by a pretty amazing guru, S. N. Goenka. He's great, a real-life laughing Buddha. Real recordings of his voice are also used for instructions. He's good and it's a wholesome program. I didn't meet a bad person there. It can also count as therapy.

Take it seriously, and it can be a rewarding reset of yourself. You're calmly and silently experiencing the present for days, with interludes to eat food... the thing is, if you do it right, meditation is profoundly calming. Just be humble. Don't have pretense of it being beneath you. It's an amazing thing to do, you just have to stop getting upset when you lose focus. The noble silence really helps, too, to quiet your mind.

I personally suffer Bulimia trouble myself. 

The hunger is your body doing anything to get nutrients ' Fuel etc..  So it over makes you think of food.  Usually Carbs as its the main source of fuel for us.  

Best advice i can give is let go of the weight gain fear..  Will you gain weight?  Yes..  Will some be fat?  Yes..  But trust me Bulimia does alot more damage than the slight fat gain.  Your teeth will suffer.  Your stomach acids will burn your full throat and mouth.  Your deprived of food fuel and vitamins so you feel drained constant and have terrible mind fog. 

Best Advice is speak to a Doctor and get some help..  Get a meal plan in place with a good amount of calories ans get rid of the scales from the house.  Thier a mental problem.  

I had the fear of oh no im gonna get fat again (Which i was)  but im still very slim and in good shape with a varied diet..  Your body doesnt gain fat as easy as some think.  

I do advice people to work out (Weights only)  dont do cardio unless is steady state ie going walks etc.  If you lift weights it improves insulin sensitivity and also let's the body create muscle ie less fat stored.

lavenderflore,1515555146.0,,,,t2_rf1g3o4,"I am recovered and here's my story: I developed bulimia at age 16. It quickly took over my life and for the next 12 years I was a hardcore and debilitated bulimic. I dropped out of college 4 times, couldn't hold a job, and my relationships were chaos, all because of bulimia. Over this time I also continuously sought help and tried every approach to healing I could find, one after another. I did everything from conventional inpatient programs, to self-help seminars, to new age visions quests. And I couldn't get better. By the end of it I was close to committing suicide I was so beaten down. So, I know the hopelessness and the despair, and the darkness of the ""tunnel.""

Then... I got better. The details of how and why I won't get into now, but in a nutshell it was a combination of hard work and a blessing.  What's important is that I was finally able to stop being bulimic, completely. For the last six years now I have not b/p'ed once nor have had urges to. I don't overeat and don't restrict. Food no longer has emotional attachment. Also my body image issues reduced to the point where they don't interfere with my life or my frequent thoughts anymore. The life I am able to live now is significantly better in quality to the life I lived as a bulimic.

So to answer your question, YES, recovery is possible.
I do want to say though, life now is not exactly the glittering post-bulimia fairytale that I imagined it would be when I was still sick.   That was one of the biggest lessons that came along with recovery.  Life is still hard.  Bulimia was just a symptom of a deeper issue of self love that I am still struggling with.  I still suffer from other manifestations of that wound - anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I also have many health complications from the bulimic years and not being in the best mental health has made physical recovery harder to manage.  So it's not a picnic.

However... I am alive.  I honestly feel like if I had kept going with bulimia, by the age I am at now, I may not have made it this far.  And although life is hard now, I have under my belt that I experienced something that, in my personal world, was a miracle.  That is a reminder that positive change and true progression is possible, when I need it.  And sometimes I forget and get sucked back into victim mode.  Like I said, it's not perfect.  But I have a courage to survive now that I didn't used to have.  There are positive, rational, loving voices inside that sometimes speak up, where there didn't used to be any.

So that's my story.  I'm happy to PM with you if you want to talk further.

coconuts_and_lime,1509655492.0,,,,t2_jktr96v,"I am what you could call fully recovered, but I don’t think those bad thoughts ever really disappeared. It’s more like I learned to deal with them. I still get the urge to purge every once in a while, but I have learned to recognize what is what in my own mentality and the consequences of my actions.

It was a tough road to get here, though, and the main reason I’m not vomiting anymore is because I’m terrified of a relapse as I know it will bring about weight gain. Because that’s exactly what my eating disorder got me, extra pounds.

I lost a lot of weight when I stopped vomiting, which was a big help. The reason for this is that restricting will always lead to over eating, and over eating will always lead to weight gain, even if you purge. So your body is always starving, causing you to instinctively eat huge amounts of food to not die. Then you purge, lose all the nutrients, keep the calories and go back to starvation again.

So you’re on the right path, starvation is not the answer. You need to keep your body fed, or getting well will be physically impossible for you. Unless you do this, it doesn’t matter how much willpower you have. Willpower is not even a part of the equation.

The next step is where it gets hard. You need to deal with all the emotional trauma that’s causing you to harm yourself. A psychologist can help you with this. 

When the previous two steps are taken care of, it is time for you to recognize your own thoughts and emotions that is keeping you in the cycle. This is where you need to decide to get well, and do your best to stick with it. Stop purging and eat reasonable amounts at reasonable intervals during the day. Don’t be afraid if you feel hungry. Food is usually close by. If you need to, eat a meal approximately 400-600 calories with at least 30% of those from protein and 30% from fat. If you’re still hungry after that, have some water and wait 30 minutes before eating more. Cutting down on carbs can be a big help as they bring about hunger hormones and insulin, which is not your friend if you’re bulimic. 

I have a lot of experiences with this, and if you would like to talk with me more you can always message me. Stay strong, recovery is really hard but you have already come a long way!

6 years ago I was diagnosed with anorexia and for the next 4 years I never went a day without counting calories. Then, I started college, stopped working out and counting calories, binged really bad and gained 22 pounds in 2 months. Over the last year and a half I have lost 17 of it, but my ED type behavior is starting to act up.

1. I’ve become a vegetarian again. I refuse to eat meat.
2. I won’t eat sweets with sugar in them.
3. Breakfast must be milk, a protein shake, or a skinny mocha because I cannot eat breakfast.
4. I can’t eat until I’ve worked out, even if that means I have to wait til 3
3. I have to burn 1050 calories a day—at least 2.5 hours of working out—and I usually try to do closer to 3 hours if I can.
4. I’ve over eaten At night/binged 19 times in the past 3 months.
5. I have not taken a day off exercise in 2 months.
6. Over exercising keeps me from food and helps me be less likely to binge, but when I’m on my period I over eat every night. (Over 949 calories net)
7. I’ve cut back from a net of 1200 to a net of 949 and eat about 2000 calories a day, but I have to burn of 1050 of them, and I will argue if something gets in my way.
8. I can’t lose weight lately probably because of the over eating. 
9. My boyfriend and best friend are worried I over exercise. 
10. I burned 1700 calories during my 4 hours of working out today (4 separate workouts) 
11. My BMI puts me in a healthy weight range
12. I will be late for class to work out or fight with my boyfriend who I am living with in order to do it
13. I counted calories even on Christmas 
14. I work the same muscles daily (my abs) 
15. I have to save 1400 Calories for 6 pm and I save 1000 for 7 pm
16. I keep binge foods away from me I.e. no snack foods and no peanut butter unless it’s the powdered peanut butter that is low fat and takes time to make 
17. I only eat foods I know the calories to, even in a binge, and if I don’t know the calories, or if I don’t want the calories, occasionally I’ve been known to chew and spit.

I've been struggling with bulimia since 2011- it was incredibly bad back then. I overcame it- but sometimes I have slip ups. And thats ok. I cut myself some slack. The thing with eating disorders is that you never really fully recover. It's always this little voice in the back of your mind that won't go away- but you have to learn certain coping mechanisms to quiet that voice, or ignore it. Sometimes you can't. Sometimes I can't. But then I pull myself back on track. 

We are only human, we do have mishaps all the time. Try and find something that gets your mind off what makes you want to binge and purge in the first place. Eat smaller meals throughout the day, take one step at a time. Exercise, draw, paint, read, write in a journal. Make steps to create coping mechanisms for yourself. And take one day at a time. I promise there is hope.

Why do you think you're eating more?Do you feel deprived,seeking comfort in food,hungry?
I also feel that the act of chewing and swallowing relaxes me greatly.
Knowing what triggers a b/p session is useful.It happened to me two days ago,out of the blue really.I'd been to see friends and eaten more than I was really happy with.My clothes felt a bit tight and when I came home I impulsively decided to eat some chocolate (I wouldn't usually have chocolate in but it was for someone else).On doing that I entered binge mode and felt so mortified that I decided I'd have to purge afterwards.I do binge without purging but then it's not typical b/p food, which I avoid buying for obvious reasons.

Right now you could be feeling ravenous because either your body needs to gain weight, because binging is now an ingrained habit, or because on some level, you need to convince yourself that you are going to let yourself get enough nutrients in the future, so you need to cut yourself a little slack for that. I also recommend highly that if you've been keeping what you've been going through a secret, tell someone you trust and love, and help them keep you accountable for not purging, and getting help.

I engaged in restricting, anorexic, bulimic behaviors for most of my life--I started when I was a kid.  In the past year, I've been in real recovery--not based on following the ""right"" diet or excessive exercise like in the past.

A couple of things had to happen for things to click.  1) I had to realize that I could not fight my biology anymore.  It got to a point where no matter how much I restricted, exercised, or purged, I could not lose weight. 2) I had to surrender to the fact that I was going to have to gain weight.  This is tough; I still struggle with it, but the cost of trying to stay at an unnatural weight for my body has been ridiculously high (physically, socially, and mentally). 

You can break the cycle--you weren't born with this.  Your body's natural state is to be balanced and healthy; we get into trouble when we get our brains involved and think we know better.  If you are seriously considering recovery, the first thing you have to do is eat regularly throughout the day (every 3 or 4 hours).  We can't fight the urge to binge if our bodies are starving.

queenoflights,1522642540.0,,,,t2_14nye89v,"Okay, so first of all I don’t think this is the place you want to ask that question, since you seem pretty dead-set on the idea and are looking for advice to go further with your disordered eating (and into a serious disorder) rather than preventing it. 

That being said, the people who are trying to talk you out of it are not doing so out of any sort of malice- in fact, the opposite. Most of us have been exactly where you are- oh, just going to do this for a bit, just to lose some weight and once I get there I’ll be done. Unfortunately, that’s just not how it works.

Ive talked with many professionals in the eating disorder field as well as clients in all levels of recovery and treatment. Even beyond the health risks which I’m sure you know (though seem to deny so I’m not going to beat a dead horse) it just simply isn’t a weight loss solution. Will you initially lose weight? Most likely. But it isn’t sustainable. Your body isn’t meant to function in the level of deprivation you want to keep it in, and it’s going to mess with your metabolism and make reintroducing a more normal eating pattern (whatever that looks like for you) difficult and uncomfortable. If you’re like the majority of the people who have “tried it out,” you’ll find the first 15-20lb just aren’t enough. “Well, I’ve gone this far... might as well keep going.” And then it never stops.

I really hope this isn’t coming off as combative because I’m not meaning for it to. I see a lot of myself in your words and I probably would not have listened to someone telling me this then either.

I purged fatty meals with lots of meat and came out easily and smoothly, not acidic foods, if that’s what you mean. I never let the acid hit my tongue. Yet I could feel my enamel thinning. Cold and hot foods became hard to eat. Not fun.

If you’re that insecure you need therapy or body positivity, not an eating disorder mate. Do you know studies have shown that the people who most successfully keep the lost weight off do not tie their worth with their weight, make slow and sustainable changes, and don’t fall into black and white thinking? I think you know that... you say it “sounds” like a viable solution. We all under appreciate health when we’re young, but we won’t be young forever.

If your meal replacement shakes, workouts, and 0 carb plan can’t make you lose weight, how will it make you make you maintain a lower weight? Losing weight = eating less calories. Maintaining lower weight = eating less calories. If you can’t lose weight without purging, then you can’t maintain a lower weight without purging.

It does sound like it's causing you distress so regardless of the diagnosis I think it warrants some assistance from someone who knows about eating disorders. If you have a case manager, you could bring it up with them and ask them for a referral to a dietician.

Have you thought about making your own pizza? Grab some pita bread, tomato paste, shredded cheese and whatever toppings you like. Or you could make mini pizzas using English muffins - top them with tomato paste and toppings and stick them under the griller. It sounds like you genuinely enjoy pizza which is fine! Have a takeaway once a week and then make your own healthier version in between.

As a fellow bipolar sufferer I understand the challenges of the medicines and post-psychosis brain where you can't organise your way out of a paper bag. But getting some good nutrition in makes a difference. 

Try not to focus on calories but try to focus on quality and getting some tasty versions of whole, unprocessed foods in like roast veges- stick a few different types on a baking tray with some olive oil and garlic and bake at 220°c until tender. You could make a pizza flavoured jacket potato.

I felt so bad because it was amazing for awhile because it had helped me not purge for a long time. Then I did Keto for a while, then relapsed.  Then, I doubled down and did zero carb for a few months.  I kept thinking I was just not strict enough and I was doing it wrong. I now realize that it only worked for a short time because I was actually allowing myself to absorb some nutrients and so I didn't have the daily insane craving for all the foods. 

I know a lot of people are helped by low carb, and I think it does have benefits.  But for someone with ED, any food restriction is going to fail.  There's something in our biology that gets triggered when we restrict--it sets off a cascade of physiological responses that we can't control.  The ""relapses"" are just our bodies trying to keep us alive because our bodies read all diets as famine.  This isn't bad exactly, in past we would have been the survivors in tough times.

If you think about that way, it totally makes sense that when we binge we usually go for the most calories and sugar dense food.  Our bodies are trying to keep us alive in the famine it thinks we are in.  We purge because we feel bad and ashamed and it gets to be a coping mechanism for difficult emotions/situations (at least in my case).

I have been amazed the past year by how not crazy I feel around ""trigger"" food.  But that's only if I eat regularly and adequately throughout the day (including carbs, fat, protein).  The less I get my brain involved in my food choices, the better I am.

I can corroborate that once you start eating, your mental health vastly improves.  In the past months, I'm realizing that a lot of the things I thought were my personality (anxiety, extreme introversion, depression) might have just the real consequences of my brain not getting the fuel it needed to function properly.

Probiotics.. Buy a decent one or eat Kefir Yoghurt or any form of fermented food.

Digestive Enzymes.. Again buy a decent one that breaks down Carbs Fats and Proteins. Amazon is good for choices. 

Not sure if you can get this off the shelf where you are but. Domperidone will work wonders. It stimulates your stomach to work better and relaxes the valve to your small intestine. I have no stomach problems if i take this 30 minutes before a meal. When i wasn't taking it my stomach just felt swollen and doing nothing. If you can get this its a wonder medicine.

Go a walk after meals.. Some walking stimulates digestion.

Ground ginger + Apple cider vinegar in a glass of luke warm water and knock that back. This helps with digestion and bloating

 I have struggled with bingeing and purging for about 5 years, struggled with body image most of my life. At first I didn’t think it would help with my ED, lost all appetite at first and was losing too much weight, and was still binging and purging fairly frequently, but not as intense as the past. It helped tremendously with my untreated ADD, and made me feel like a normal human with focused thoughts. The vyvance along with a steady routine for myself has allowed me to focus on self care and become healthier. I have been binge/purge free for 16 days, which is the longest I have ever gone in the 5 years. The strong desire to binge/purge is also gone, past recovery attempts would leave me anxious and stuck on negative thoughts in the evenings especially. I feel a sense of relief now.
Medication acts differently for everyone, and a lot of effort on yourself is also needed. This is a good option for myself, but it’s not for everyone. Good luck on your journey.

_lily_belle_,,,,,t2_fziy4,"Hey, congratulations on recognizing the issue, and I’m so happy you want to fight it. It’s a worthwhile battle, because this shit ruins your life. It does become all you focus on and it WILL effect your studies and impede relationships. 


When I was about your age I joined a therapy group focusing on eating disorders. It was about 5-10 girls at any one time that cycled somewhat regularly, as there was always new people coming in and regulars filtering in and out. And there were usually 4-6 solid girls there who were really working on a change. It is a fantastic space to learn all sorts of coping behaviors and new skills. I was very awkward and felt like I could not connect with people; I made some of my closest friends in that group. We are still together about 6 years later, and have a bond that is very personal and sympathetic. 

Plus, it is a safe space to talk about your issue with people who really understand. A chance to hear yourself say things out loud, and hear from other perspectives. It really helped me, and took a huge weight off my shoulders. When I struggle, I call my girls. When they struggle, they call me. 

Since you’re in a city I think you have a good chance finding such a group. I’ve seen ones advertised in my local newspaper, but I joined mine through my therapist, who ran the group. Perhaps find a therapist who specializes in EDs first, but even if you just jump right into the group, they are good at being patient while you work up courage to speak up and share. 

I hope this helps. Don’t stop fighting. ED stole my life. Don’t let him take yours.

bell1986,,,,,t2_fv7d8st,"Are you eating enough calories? If your meal planning then also make sure your meals are balanced.. Protein carbs &amp; especially fats.. Fats in recovery are gonna be a huge help for hormonal reasons.

Don't restrict a food group also.. For me my trigger is fast acting carbohydrates. My blood sugar spikes and crashes so quick it leaves me feeling ravenous which in turn causes a relapse. So i try stay away from these. Rice is a very quick digesting carb and looks like a big trigger of yours so for now just cut it out. 

If your still in a deficit of calories. Your brain will still remain in a famine state. So it's gonna FORCE you to go and eat. Food thoughts ALL day. Extreme hunger etc.. Once you eat consistently and also in a surplus of calories ie more calories than your body burns your brain will switch back to running normal again. Can take months but anyone who has recovered says its utter relief. They can eat a normal meal and stop whenever they like. This is how inpatient treatments work... They basically make you eat well balanced foods and for a good period of time and it will ALWAYS be in a surplus. 1) Too gain some healthy weight 2) Get your brain out of the famine mode.

It isn't a short road and the beginning is tough with bloating, weight fluctuations, meal planning and everything else that comes along with recovery but it is possible and once you start recovering and treating your body right you wont want to look back.

I guess the main concern is that it can be a huge strain on your relationship. You can inadvertently project your angst at the food and your ED onto your girlfriend as she is controlling the food. It's also a big ask on her to provide that level of emotional care. Even psych nurses clock off everyday.

Personally, it can be a useful very short term measure but if it has come to that then I'd probably be suggesting that you look into more intensive treatment.

This feeling itself can make people relapse as they can't handle the uncomfortable feeling. Also with very slow digesting do you notice a constant hunger? This is related also. 

Do you have access to a doctor? You should go and get prescribed Domperidone. It will make your stomach start digesting proper again until your body gets use to the food again. It does heal though.

But you should eat easy to digest foods for now if you can. Low fat/low fibre foods. Leave out vegetables for a few weeks also. Thier too harsh on your stomach just now.

Here is some things that will help also. 

Apple cider vinegar. Take a tablespoon before meals.

Ginger.. Awesome for helping digestion. If you can handle the taste. Add some ground ginger to a glass with a shot of apple cider vinegar. Add a little water and throw is back. Tastes awful but is amazing for your digestion.

Digestive Enzymes. Thier cheap on Amazon. Buy one that breaks down all the food groups.

I have another Reddit username that I use for 'normal' posting and would always read these threads but never respond; I work in silicon valley tech, and my coworkers talk about using these websites to research Reddit usernames... they are awful... so I've always been paranoid. Finally, I just created another username so I could interact and not feel ashamed. Saw this thread and was like.. wait, we're all the same age.. okay, time to get involved.

It's funny, my username 'survivor' because - although I'm currently alive - I still think about binging and purging so much that referring to myself as a survivor sometimes feels like a joke. I went into cardiac arrest when I was in college - I can honestly say, I did let any food sit in my stomach without purging for... years. Even after my heart stopped for a full two minutes, I still didn't stop B&amp;Ping. Kept it from everyone. But was so tired of it. It felt like such a job. I was chained to it.

Anyway, I just had a baby about six months ago. Years of infertility (which I felt like was somehow a consequence or God reprimanding me for my ED). But, finally, I got pregnant and we had her. She's my life.. but I'm so overweight. The extra pounds have really triggered me into thinking about going back into it. A lot. I haven't yet, but I just hate the way I look and feel. How many more times am I going to wake up on a Monday, open my MyFitnessPal app, log foods for a week, drop a quick 5lbs the healthy way, then... start thinking about this.

I'm with you. This is the worst. Sorry to drop this diatribe. I really just wanted to say.. you're not alone. I think about this everyday. I wish that I could find a healthy way to lose weight with a group of people - like us - who are just trying to do life. And lose weight. But without the guilty feelings, without the self hate.

humanbinchicken,,,,,t2_1tm6xkck,"At the height of my activity, I wasn’t ever dehydrated or malnourished and also drank plenty of non-sugar drinks and ate heaps of fruit and veg.  I looked very healthy... 54 kilos or 120 pounds.  I had a sporty, athletic body type and I was physically active.  I think the issue was an electrolyte imbalance that affects the pericardium.  I had blood pressure issues as a result.  I never had to force myself to be sick either... would just drink a shit tonne of water quickly and bend over the toilet.  Quick and easy... plus the water meant that I never had issues with stomach acid ruining my teeth.  When you do it long term, you find ways to limit the damage, but I guess it caught up with me.  I’m 10 kilos overweight now due to using Depo Provera because my cycle got really messed up, but haven’t been actively harming myself for a bit over 2 years, despite thinking about it very often.  I see myself as uncomfortably overweight, but I’m trying to make healthier choices and find more sustainable solutions to loose the unwanted weight.  

One of the ways I rationalised needing to stop, was working out why I did it in the first place.  I’ve never been to counselling for this issue, but know it came from a loss of personal autonomy while I was married and a sexual assault from when I was younger, in addition to having a narcissist father that would regularly make derogatory comments about my weight as a child, even though I was well within a normal and healthy range and was wearing a full body brace for scoliosis 23 hours a day, which meant I couldn’t put on weight or it would make breathing difficult.

I diet'd down like crazy and the weight honestly fell off in no time. I don't have too many memories of the actual diet itself but i remember being very restrictive.. Back then i never had Myfitnesspal etc so macros i never even knew about. I just watched the scale daily and basically.... Starved.

Then... Bulimia struck. I was at a weight i felt really comfortable at. You know... *normal* and i was like ok I'm gonna stop this diet and just keep active and just keep an eye on things. I was slim in my teens and ate ANYTHING and honestly never gained a gram but i was never obsessed by foods then. I ate when my body says.. Im hungry. Soon as my mind switched off that diet mentality my brain was FORCING me to binge like crazy. All the foods i had cut out for like 5 months straight. I then started to purge due to guilt and that cycle just gets stronger and stronger.... Trust me

Now I'm about 9 years on and Bulimia is still with me. I have had very long periods in these years where my Bulimia has gone and i just ate a good balanced diet and eventually my body became nourished again and felt normal. But... Soon as i hit bad stress in life. Ie my job etc.. Bulimia was a release. I would stress and just want to eat everything sweet and tasty and then.... Guilt and... Purge. So i was back in the cycle.

Honestly you need to stop now.. Be happy with the weight you are at and just start to eat balanced. You will get days you binge and yes. On the scale your weight will climb but it's not all fat.. We store TONS of water and we also store glycogen in our muscles. But.. You will have days your just not as hungry and... It all balances out.

Please stop.. I have had drug addictions.. Alcohol addictions and also... Bulimia. Trust me this is the strongest of them all. I beat the other 2 addictions but still struggle with this.

I can relate to what you’re saying and what helped me was just deleting my calorie tracker app. Not seeing the red number that told me how much I went over made a big difference even if i mentally calculated how much I went over.

Idk why or where it comes from, but I Def think it has to do with your inner self seriously wanting to get better. You're on a good path my friend. Fighting bulimia is so, so very tough.

csasszer,,,,,t2_1q4ti253,"Hi there,  


I have been also struggling with the same problem as your BF for 2-3 years. I was obsessed with training, eating, getting everything done in the proper way...  


I faced the issue last year and told me girlfriend first of all. The hardest part, of dealing with an eating disorder and seeing a false picture in the mirror, is **realising that you are sick** and need help... Someone who doesn't suffer from this will never understand how hard it is.  


In the last 7 months I have purged two times, ""only"", which is two times more than it should be.  


**What helped me:**  
\- Accepting the fact that someone cannot eat 100% ""clean"" and according to the books, achieving 70-80% is already a great result  
\- I plan so called ""re-feed"" days (mostly holidays, occasions with family/friends), where I allow myself to anything, moderately (One slice of cake for example). These days are good for your mind.

\- By chasing 100% will make someone's body and mind tired pretty soon, so the point above helps you maintain a good balance (80-20).  
\- I am a pretty big guy (6'55"", 210 lbs), with a huge hunger, literally huge. I applied intermittent fasting to my daily regime, meaning that I eat only two times a day.  
\- I recommend Crossfit as a sport because it puts someone's body in situation where she/he cannot even imagine. It burns great amount of calories, which allows me to eat more daily. This is the other key besides Intermittent Fasting. Combining them helps me to eat almost as much as I want (from good sources ofc) and still loosing fat, becoming more muscular.  
\- He can even try One Meat A Day (OMAD) approach.  
\- Last but not least, accepting that we are human beings with tons of other responsibilities. Life should be about enjoying events where you can and drink with your friends. I missed tons of moments during these occasions because I was too busy with myself, eating clean. I also accepted that sometimes I cannot make it to gym due to work. Sometimes I'm not in the mood for that. Every day is a new chance to eat clean, go to the gym, share experiences, spend quality time with loved ones. We shouldn't regret the mistakes we make sometimes, but focus more on the upcoming day when you start it over.  


Hope this helps you and him.  


If you need more help, reach out to me.

kolibri22,,,,,t2_cmb5c,"I have been there many times, but I am here to tell you that recovery is possible. It is a long trudge with many ups and downs, but you are not sentenced to a life of this. Twelve step programs like OA very literally saved my life. They are not for everyone, but when I was finally willing to do anything to get better, they were the single most powerful tool and the people I met were more accepting and understanding than I ever thought possible. That, and a great therapist, which also took some trial and error to find, were some of the biggest helps. I find that urges get much worse as it gets later in the day, so I try to set my day off right with some spiritually positive rituals like making a list of everything I am grateful for, some meditation and stretching and a complete healthy, but low calorie breakfast like Greek yogurt, granola and berries, something not triggering. I would also recommend working with a nutritionist on a meal plan. You can usually get a referral from your primary care. Lastly, cooking my own food and learning to cook healthy things that I enjoy was enormously important for me in changing my relationship with food. It switched the power dynamic. Now, I try to live by an ethic that I don't harm my body ever and try to view food as beautiful, a gift from the earth. I still am particular about what I eat and there are certain foods that will always be a trigger, so I avoid them, but food does not run my life today. Most of the time, I genuinely love food. I still have bad days. When something stressful happens I still want to purge, but I am learning that just because I have an urge does not mean I have to act on it. Discomfort is not something that needs to be resolved immediately. You can sit with it, feel where it is happening in your body, acknowledge it, and then tell yourself it will pass and go distract yourself until it does. Once the urge is gone I am always so glad I didn't purge. The reality is, the times I was purging  a lot in my life were the times I was at my heaviest (plus my body hurt, I couldn't get out of bed I was so tired, I was depressed and acting crazy without realizing it, irritable towards everyone and utterly hopeless). When I first started off in recovery (inpatient) I felt like I was gaining 5 pounds a day (after a week or so of me throwing fits, they agreed to show me my weight and I hadn't  a pound). Ultimately, though, I did gain weight and it did make me panic, but I just kept trying and little by little the mental obsession became less and less. As I improve, the more my life fills up with healthy, happy, therapeutic things because of it, the smaller the obsession gets still. I still have an ED, I always will, but purge episodes are rare and always unfulfilling. I look and feel physically the best I have since high school (I'm 30) and I have the energy to go hiking and do well at work and be happy. I continue to see a therapist and work on my ED and sometimes I still get so angry about all the pain I've had to go through, but my life is not about my ED today. I don't spend every waking moment running through what I've eaten that day and what I will eat. I don't get giddy over private bathrooms. Purging does not give me a sense of relief, only regret. I know how impossible it seems that life will ever be any other way, but I promise, it's possible.

bell1986,,,,,t2_fv7d8st,"I am at this stage just now also.. A daily ritual 👎  I become insanely irritable and almost out of control until i get my 'fix' which gives me relief for a few hours and then it starts all over again.

I think it is a combination of things.

Malnutrition
Addiction
Depression
Anxiety
Poor relationship with food.

We become so nutrient deficient and continuously make it worse the longer we binge and purge.. Even though we're gaining weight this is purely because carbohydrates break down almost instantly in the mouth and stomach and are absorbed VERY quickly. Where vegetables fruits and proteins are digested very slowly and never get a chance to leave the stomach. So even though we gain weight it is purely from a sugar/carbohydrate absorption. So we purge and all the 'good' stuff is purged back up and then just sugar is loaded into our body with zero nutrition attached. So it's a vicious cycle because your brain does run on sugar/glucose but your body also needs vitamins minerals and nutrients to actually sustain itself so all our organs are shouting for nutrition and our brain just sends signals for you to eat and replenish your body. These signals are STRONG and we end up binging. Not because we're just hungry but because your body needs a MASS of nutrition. This is why people in treatment are put on a meal plan and they can't get away to purge and after a period of time when your body gets a steady state of nutrition that voice from the brain becomes less and less and eventually says. 'We're good' this is when your hunger signals come back and you can eat normal again.

I sometimes picture myself at this level. Just to be able to go out for a meal with my partner and actually enjoy the conversation instead of thinking. How many calories is this? Does it have anywhere i could purge? Then you end up with a guilty conscience as your partner has just paid a meal that you have thrown up. To be able to have energy each day and not sit in a dark place inside my mind and be anxious constantly. 

I hope you eventually get the help you deserve. It really isn't a life with this disease 👎  Reach out for help if you can. I have and it's a slow process but i have faith we can all recover from this illness and find our feet again.

queener_beaner,,,,,t2_duckq,"Oof. She's obviously in the thick of it, I imagine anything you might say would severely alienate her and cause her to retreat. I'd hide/not buy any typical binge-y foods like cookies/pasta/chips/crackers/cheese and try to set an example of enjoying your food. When she does eat, I'm guessing she only eats veggies/""healthy"" things. Have that available, she probably feels safer around stuff like that and less impulsive.

Maybe have an evening where you all cook together and she helps prepare food and make it fun! Listen to music, have a theme! She's likely not going to magically get rid of her eating disorder in the next 10 or so days, so all you can do is just be kind, be open and set a good example of having a positive relationship around food. 

It wouldn't hurt to have a private, one-on-one conversation with her that's *not directly calling her out.* Maybe just casually bring up that you read an article/heard a story about eating disorders and you never knew how life-threatening they can be, ""isn't that scary?!""

traumavomit,,,,,t2_4lmtenex,When you constantly purge you burn off all the taste buds on your tongue.

You aren’t seeing much results because honestly bulimia isn’t that effective for losing weight unless you restrict too.

So I just... maintain? But god, life would be so much better without this illness!

I've recently had some success with not binging and purging - but the problem is, I don't know how to eat regular meals, so I end up eating barely anything and losing more weight, which isn't sustainable.

I'm a teacher currently on school holidays, and every holidays I tell myself, this is an opportunity to rest and establish some good eating habits. And every holidays I invariably fall into a food-obsessed cook/binge/purge/exercise cycle. Between that and school work, I have no time to actually enjoy the time off or pursue any hobbies, and part of me doesn't even want to.

I don't even know what drives this anymore. It's purely an addiction, plus I don't know any other way of being.

MaeveTheLion,,,,,t2_56uhothq,"A friend of mine once told me that when she eats she literally visualizes the nutrients from her food being absorbed into her muscles and regenerating her energy. I've always liked that image when I need to slow down and focus on what I'm doing with my body. 

Shalane Flanagan and Elyse Kopecky (both runners, one an Olympian and the other a nutritionist) wrote two cookbooks for runners. My favorite is Run Fast, Cook Fast, Eat Slow. Elyse writes about female athletes and the difficulty many have with eating. Shalane talks about how using Elyse's guidance and not counting calories she was able to get down to her competitive running weight without feeling hungry all the time (and win the NY Marathon). 

I find the book helpful when I need role models to emulate and ""safe"" foods. (""Safe"" for me means food I can eat without worrying exactly how healthy it is). They also embrace carbs, which I find so helpful to keeping my energy up and that insane hunger at bay. 

One last thought: Kathryn Hansen (another author, who struggled with bulimia) talks about how when we become addicted to something, like binging, an ancient part of our brain starts to think that behavior is REQUIRED for survival.   Leading to insane urges to do the thing you're addicted to (like binging). One of the most powerful ideas in her book was that she didn't need to make the urge to binge go away, she needed to change how she reacted to those urges. She viewed the urge to binge as an automatic function of that ancient part of her brain, and separate from herself. She saw the pain and discomfort of resisting a binge as temporary, and diminishing over time. The true has been the same for me.

ziyal79,,,,,t2_fi54h,"1. Teeth yellowing is actually normal for most people. If you must purge, then the best thing you can do is rinse your mouth out with water.

2. It's probably normal for a bit of throat inflammation, but I can't speak to the problems you're having. That's not my experience of ""normal"", if that means anything.

3. It's never going to feel like you're purging enough. Eating disorders constantly seek to invalidate you, at least in my experience.

4. Your body doesn't care, and a purge is still a purge. It's still traumatic to your body and your oesophagus and your teeth.

5. Sometimes purging occurs with out a binge, just after a normal meal. That was most of my experience of purging. Is this okay? No purging is good, it's always a lose-lose situation.

I've been bulimic (and kind of gravitated towards and away from recovery for 13 or 14 years now, and I tell you what, my teeth are wrecked. Biting my nails in combination with years of daily/weekly purging has caused my teeth to literally break apart. 

More than that, I have a faulty oesophageal sphincter from years of throwing up and that means I get constant reflux and have to take strong proton pump inhibitor medication to stop the stomach acid causing oesophageal cancers that have LESS than a 5% 5 year survival rate. The proton pump inhibitors may put me at risk of stomach cancers as well. It's a risk I have to manage as I age.

Oh and the last thing, I have managed to stop vomiting and have gravitated more towards fasting and restriction to cope, but I have lost and gained the same 50 pounds repeatedly since my early 20s. Bulimia will never you thin. It'll make you fat, sad, and physically and mentally ill.

graamatvede,,,,,t2_fw1no,"Hi! Not sure I have advice, but can share my experience. I'm also a runner and weightlifter, 7 months purge free, f/33. I gained some 15 pounds since the start of my recovery, and about 5 months in I went to a body builder who helped me with a 1500 cal diet, and I also started losing 1 pound a week. From one side I loved the feeling, from the other, in 3 weeks my shoulders started revealing my anorexic past, and I got scared. I got scared id go back into the starving mode again. The good thing was that with that meal plan I learned what a normal portion size is, and I learned to eat carbs - rice, bread - things I was afraid of before. I also had very little energy and was irritable on the diet, and felt urges to binge, since still worked out. I did binge 2 or 3 times when eating about a 100 grams of chocolate (for me, that is a binge, because it happened with trembling fingers, chaotic, almost secretive unwrapping of the chocolates and huge sense of guilt) - but didn't purge afterwards. Now I got a new trainer for a couple of weeks and he makes a huge difference on my mental state (he doesnt know about the ED) - he tells me to eat like a monster truck for the amount of workouts I do, he tells me to forget about six packs and not strive for some unattainagle stage body, he tells me to enjoy every single training session and have no more than 4 per week, he forbids me to compare myself to other women. He asks that I give myself time, nourish myself, get good sleep and enjoy each training session and aim for a sustainable, healthy lifestyle. It has helped me a lot to let go of my fears to eat or wanting to restrict. There is a good youtube video ""Can you try to lose weight in recovery?"" by What Mia Did Next, and at first I didn't agree with her (of course, my ilness and wish to control my weight was stronger) - but now I do.

MaeveTheLion,,,,,t2_56uhothq,"I also used Psychology Today and Google to find people in my area. After trying a couple therapists, I decided that I needed someone that focused on eating disorders, had at least a decade of experience, and someone I clicked with. I wound up calling a few people, explaining the basics, and having a short conversation with a few therapists. Narrowed down on one and she was a *gift*. I saw her for about a year and a half and I learned so many coping mechanisms. I don't think recovery \*requires\* a therapist, but it sure is helpful to have someone to keep you honest,  avoid pitfalls, and build healthy skills.

Kata_S,,,,,t2_10yxxy,"Hi. I’ve experienced a very similar situation as you while still in high school, including actually being kicked out. I recognize your fear but it’s likely that your family does not hate you. They are fearful because they do not want you to suffer. When people do not understand a scary situation (such as their child being bulimic), they resort to anger. I do not know your exact situation, but if you clearly explain to them what exactly you’re struggling with, your parents will probably help you. It’s about simplifying the situation, making it less of a scary unknown. If you think about food constantly, putting physical barriers may be a way to prevent binges. If you calmly explain to your parents the steps that could help you, such as putting locks on certain cabinets, or helping you by asking how your relationship with food has been every few days (kind of keeping you in check), they will most likely help you. However, you should definitely also consult a medical professional. For me, these steps never happened, which lead to 5 years of struggle and ruined relationships. I don’t think you should sacrifice communication.

bystromspet,,,,,t2_5e5pxgsw,"I’ve tried several different methods/foods and feels like sometimes one of them worked better than other. I think it’s just all about trying out what works best for you. Here were my methods: 

1.) Low calorie foods, big amounts, to feel full. 
* Always thought this was the way to go but it just kept making things eventually worse. It just causes you to be full and sort of your body still wants to eat more because you eat so little calories etc. And when I was sitting in restaurant whatsoever eating foods with higher calorie intake I would eat BIG AMOUNTS due my stretched stomach, get nausea, and purge. This method would probably work just couple days, max week, as a introduction phase to “non purge” life but it doesn’t give long lasting results. 

2.) Controlling meal times. 
* This includes everything from “Eat every 3 hours” to “Intermitting fasting”. My doctor recommended 2000 calories and 6 meals per day so probably this works for many. For me, it just gets too stressful. 

3.) Eating normal stuff and full meals. 
* This was best method for me and I did not expect that. It sort of started as a coincidence; I was living with my boyfriend and ate same meals as he, which is just you know, normal food. Can be pasta with tomato sauce, salad on side, and something small for dessert. According to Asian culture to fully satisfy your inner need of food the meal has to contain all areas; salty, sweet, sour. This was scary in the beginning, but it was so incredible how satisfied I felt just eating “normal meals”. After breakup I kept on eating out a lot; I mean eating lunch in lunch restaurants etc. and now when I cook for myself I always make sure it’s a full meal with carbs, protein, fat and something small sweet for dessert (like a fruit or piece of dark chocolate).",,,1583770168,,,fk10rw4,False,t3_fd15h3,,True,t3_fd15h3,/r/bulimia/comments/fd15h3/tips_on_how_to_start/fk10rw4/,,1583770323,1,,True,False,bulimia,t5_2tmc8,,,,,[],,text,,,,False,{},,[],False,0.0,[],,,False,,,,

bystromspet,,,,,t2_5e5pxgsw,"Don’t talk about food, calories, macronutrients whatsoever. As someone with eating disorder believe me when I say that she probably knows A LOT about that subject, and she has been basically controlling her weight a long period which has caused her to have mental disease where in order to control her caloric intake she will be ready to risk her health, in the worst case even her life, as bulimia can lead to quick-death (one purge session can lead to heart stop). 

Never ever shame your own or someone else’s body. Don’t say “I’m fat” ever ever, that’s absolutely the worst one can say. Or “Omg I can’t believe I just ate all that!”. And the worst; “Are you really going to eat all that?”. You can lose your weight and eat healthy and having your opinions about your own or someone else’s body without bringing it up.

Don’t push her or think it’s easy to stop binge and purge. It is one of the most complicated mental diseases to overcome, even with professional help, so even if you think you have great solutions (my favorite when people said “you should eat small portions every 3 hours so you don’t get hungry” or “drink water”) keep them to yourself. She has probably already been scrolling desperately Google to find out how to stop, and the tip she has found is “Tell someone you know and get professional help, otherwise you will not survive”. You simplifying the problem will just make her feel even more shame and anxiety, and she will end up BP more. 

Generally, as long as you don’t make a big thing about it, don’t start trigger conversations around food/weightloss/body picture and just be there and support her by listening you’ll be fine.

bystromspet,,,,,t2_5e5pxgsw,"I was in exactly same situation as you. In the beginning of my anorexia, I saw clearly myself losing weight. But then I had this extreme, almost like I’d been hallucinating, phase where I could clearly see myself gaining weight but the weight was still going down. 

I’m not a doctor, and I don’t claim that any of my advice/theory’s should be used as reliable facts, but I’ve been studying psychology on base levels and then as a “hobby” I’ve been reading a lot about subject. So here’s something; 

Some studies have shown that the part of the brain which is responsible for 3D visualization gets shrunk/is naturally smaller/gets disturbed among those with eating disorders. In one study people with anorexia had to estimate in how big of hole they could be able to fit from. They could pretty well estimate correct others, but estimated terribly wrong their own capability to fit holes. So according to my theory, this phase of horribly mis estimating the size of our bodies can be early signs of that part of brain getting disturbed. What I’ve been reading, it’s quite common phase and for some it last a lot longer. For me it balanced out eventually, and I could again see myself getting smaller as my weight was going down.

bystromspet,,,,,t2_5e5pxgsw,"Even after recovery it is hard to normalize the mindset. It is hard to remember how life was before the number on scale and weight became the center of life. It feels almost impossible to regain that mindset we once had, where life was about enjoying the sunlight, spending time with friends, listening to good music and just being happy to be able experience life in all its forms.

At the end of our days, when we are old, when we have lived our lives with our kids, careers, and all the experiences of life we will be never ever looking back at our weights. We will not remember the number on scale. If anything, we will regret how much our precious time we spent on controlling our weight and worrying about it when in fact, it was never important.

We must understand, that honestly, no one else but we care about how much we weight. We are the only ones living our life. Weight goes up and down, life only goes forward. Ofcourse it is sad that we had to go through ED and spent so much time for it, but now it’s time to stop. If that means gaining 10kg, 20kg or even more then so it will be. It’s just part of the recovery, and most often will eventually balance itself out. Be patient. Give it time. There is absolutely no reason to risk another good years of your life for this disease.

You love yourself. You are grateful for your body because it can take you to outdoors with your feet, you can see the sunlight with your eyes, you can smell the early spring mornings with your nose, you can communicate with others with your mouth, your hands makes it easier for you to enjoy your adventure on this planet and your ears will hear the sound of birds. 

You accept that in order to live these upcoming years on your fullest your body might change a bit. It might go up and down. Eventually you will be healthy. If you’d then like to go down on weight not because you hate your body but because you love it, you might do it. But as long as that might risk your happiness and put you back into starting point, you don’t care about it. It’s only you who cares about it, and if you choose not to care about it no one does. 

In my own experience I gained approx 20kg in one year, then it naturally stayed on the same weight all the time (I didn’t scale myself that often) and then it naturally went a bit down.

whateverz_,,,,,t2_58lrb3du,"Hi honey! 

I went through the same exact thing - still struggling with it! You have to take baby steps, cause Rome wasn’t built in a day. I struggle eating at restaurants bc the second I get full, I’m off the restroom. Just asking a friend to come along prevents me from purging. Try little things like this! 

Also not the best advice but a tad bit more effective: try intuitive eating. If you aren’t hungry, don’t eat. You’ll just end up purging and ruining your teeth. (side note: ALWAYS swish water afterwards and avoid brushing your teeth for a few hours).

Doing sports makes you crave those carbs and salts and your body NEEDS salt for your electrolyte balance. Especially with purging, if that electrolyte balance is thrown off, it could be deadly.

Try sneaking in small things that help you change your diet, or at least outlook on your diet. If eating breakfast is too much first thing in the morning, skip it. Or have a low calorie, high volume smoothie! Unsweetened non-dairy mills are low in calories, spinach is very filling and high in nutrients, low in calories. berries are also pretty calorie-friendly as well! 

Make sure you’re drinking your water! If I feel snacky I’ll literally just chug my water and crunch on the ice for some relief :)

I get support by telling a friend and then venting and relying on them a little bit. And therapy. But I'm not cured . If you can get on antidepressants it does help a little and sertraline/zoloft is an antidepressant that helps with bulimia so mention that you want to try that if you can.

cx222,,,,,t2_5gk53k9d,"I think your first priority should be to get as far away from purging as you can. From how you told your situation I get the idea that this hasn't been going on for long at least the behavior. And from experience I can tell you that purging is something that makes itself a part of you and It takes a lot of effort and strength to get out of it. 

Second of do you purge because you have binges or do you just purge the food you eat. I think it's important to look at the reasons your doing it so you can look at what you can do about the cause of the behavior. 

What I what would do is:
1.if you are purging because you have binges, make some sort of plan for yourself on when and what you are going to eat and don't buy foods that really trigger your binges. I understand that keeping track of your food can be very disordered as well but I think from what you wrote that it's a good thing to at least not fall further into bulimia/ED behaviors. 

2.if you are just purging everything you are eating, I would suggest making yourself a meal plan, preferably made by a dietitian or docter, but if you don't have access to that, there  may be someone you trust who can help you with it. This may help you to stop worrying about everything you eat making you gain weight, cause it's at that point not you Ed's choice hat you eat, but it's the meal the plan that decides. 

3.seek help from somebody who you can trust, like a family member. And if you get acces to it, go to a docter. I know it's scary but it will help in the long run

I hope this helped a bit, keep in mind I'm not a docter I'm just speaking from my own personal experience.

cmavepine,,,,,t2_d6n1iu2,"Hi. I have been in the same shitty b/p cycle like you.

In the beginning of 2019 I had become a little chubby because my binge episodes had become more frequently and more calorie rich. 

After 11 years of b/p episodes I had just become so mentally tired and purging was getting too tough for me.

I decided to do all the stuff that you can read online about recovery. First of all you have to forget all about weight and weightloss when you are recovering (damn hard!) Second, you need to take the time to plan three healthy meals every day. Your body needs to recovery, it needs vitamins, it needs to know that everything is alright and that it will get food whenever it needs it. 

Your body also needs rest, meaning that I didn't do cardio for three weeks at first. I started to introduce cardio slowly and only on the premise that I did it out of joy and not to punish myself for something I ate.

Now, 1 year later things is going a bit better. I'm still recovering and proberly will be for the rest of my life, but you know what.. I am taking control of the shitty b/p cycle now. Even though I have had appx 5 fallbacks I now that I am trying my best to recover and that I am on the right path.

Hel_l_en,,,,,t2_5pav44kc,"Heyah! Well to begin with. Its NEVER too late to get help. Unfortunately throwing up can cause rotten teeth (thats why ur teeth hurt). I dont know your relationship with your family but they should be supportive. Bulimia is an eating disorder....a sickness. They shouldn't make you feel worst than you already feel!
Now in my opinion you have to think about yourself. Do you think it will help u if u tell them? Yes they love u to the moon and back but will they express their love in a toxic way? 
If you dont want to tell them, choose a friend. Its good to talk about it with someone.
I am not aware of your age but you should also go to a therapist. (It doesnt have to be one you can try many until you find the most suitable) 
Now dont get me wrong. A therapist doesn't have a magic want that will make bulimia go away. You will have to work HARD. Its a difficult journey but its worth it.
The first thing you have to do is think WHY and HOW it started. Most, started cause they wanted to loose weight but its not they only reason! Some also think that the addicting thing is the ""control"" you think you have over what you eat.
However the truth is u r not free. You cant enjoy food and slowly but surely you will isolate yourself.
Bulimia doesnt fix ANY problems (like seriously it doesn't even make u loose weight) so ye.
Determination my friend. Many of us are going through it. Sending you all the support. (Also you can start watching youtubers who got over bulimia. Make sure they are healthy tho because if they are ""in the process"" of self-treatmen then their channel can work as a bulimia group where u compare what u eat to them. Watch the people who got better to see the happiness in their eyes.

fallacyfallacy,,,,,t2_kgqgw,"So, I live in Scotland and told my GP I was suffering from disordered eating without specifying bulimia. At first she said that I could be put on a waiting list for therapy which would take up to 3 months, and that I couldn't get immediate help unless I was suicidal or had a bmi under 19 (mine is about 25 so nowhere near that threshold) She then gave me a list of resources and recommended I download headspace and try some self care, like taking a warm shower or watching Netflix. 

I was pretty sure that mediation and netldix wouldn't be great solutions to my problems (as I'm sure you can imagine) so I explained to her more specifically that I had been purging and that I was really in need of support (the fact that I started crying then probably helped lol) at which point she gave me an appointment for a psychiatric evaluation, which is in 10 days. 

I'm not entirely sure what will happen then and I don't want to overstate my problems and take away services from people who ARE suicidal/very underweight but as bulimia mortality rates are just a bit lower than those of anorexia (although mine definitely isn't so severe as to be a threat to my life), but after struggling with this for almost a year I think I really do need help and that it would prevent future physical and mental harm, so hopefully I'll be able to get regular sessions sooner rather than later.

I know in England you can self-refer for therapy (not sure where you are) but if going through your GP is your only option I'd say it's definitely worth going, especially if you're really struggling, just be clear that you really need help - your GP should know the danger you're in and treat it as serious.

Satelliteminded,1421904990.0,,,,t2_kvdzu,"A short term solution is to “urge surf” - literally distract yourself when you feel the urge to binge or purge. This is similar to the strategy that smokers use when quitting - just try to wait 5 more minutes until the craving passes. (Pick a healthy/harmless activity to do to help you distract yourself - go for a walk, play a stupid phone game, Reddit, color, knit, etc.) The goal here is to get used to the physical and emotion discomfort of not doing THE THING just long enough to help break the cycle. You may have lapses, but just keep trying. 

The long term solution is to discover the underlying psychological or emotional reason that you binge and purge. A therapist can help with this. For example in my own experience I examined how anxiety led me to zone out during meal times, and perfectionism/body dysmorphia contributed to the resulting purge. 

The emotional component is what really helped me move on from bulimia. In the past I’ve had periods where I think I’ve “quit being bulimic out of sheer willpower” because I am dieting/exercising carefully, and therefore don’t feel like bingeing and purging. But in reality my thinking during those periods was still unhealthy, anxious, and marred by perfectionism. Then as soon as something stressful happened in my life, I would fall apart and start the bulimia cycle again. 

Therapy takes time though, and it requires you to be emotionally vulnerable which can be scary. In the meantime urge surfing, aka distress tolerance, (which I believe is a concept from dialectical behavioral therapy) can probably help you get started.

Kaptain_Kangaroo,1421204950.0,,,,t2_kpatp,"&gt; I never tought it would happen. I need to take control. Tomorrow, I won't binge. The day after either. I went too far today. If I had really done it I don't think I could have gone back. It's still time. But I need motivation. I need people to tell me that I can do it. 


What I would advise you right now is to try and micromanage your day as much as you can. Don't even think in terms of ""tomorrow"". Try looking at the next couple of days as 6 hour segments and try to plan each 6 hour block carefully. Write down a detailed list, and include even the most mundane stuff. Start with what you plan to eat and schedule a specific time to do it (it's a 6 hour window so you can easily say ""meal at 1pm: protein vegetables, dairy, then snack (fruit) at 6pm"" for example). Then write down who you plan to call for support- this is **not** the easiest thing to do as bulimics tend to isolate (many of us don't trust people easily). You can always arrange to simply hang out with some family or friends, even if that means talking about the weather; ***as long as you are occupied!***. If you attend support group meetings, include that on your list, and write down a specific time when you plan to go. You should even include when you plan to sleep, when you'll brush your teeth, take a bath, etc (all routine stuff but your list needs to be as full as possible). Try and set some time aside for a 30 minute walk. If possible do this with a friend- time goes by faster and you're not stuck with negative thoughts in your head when you have someone to talk to. 

Please go through the process of writing all this stuff down and look at the list as something you have to stick to, ***for the next 6 hours ONLY!***. Don't think in terms of days or weeks because it will seem overwhelming and you'll be less likely to follow through. 

Creating some structure and order in your daily routine is a good first step in fighting off the emotional triggers behind binge-purge episodes. 

I hope this helps. Please let us know how you've been doing.

For me though, it got to the point where I needed extended leave from work in order to help me deal with my issues. I was having multiple appointments with medical professionals so it was difficult to hide - especially from the children living at home so I felt like I needed to share my struggles.

However you should probably visit your Dr anyway- better safe than sorry.

I had to purge my entire life of anything diety: food scale, bathroom scale, calorie counting apps, fitness social media accounts and subreddits, any kind of restriction whatsoever. I had to give up the desire to lose weight altogether. I still feel that mentality creep into my brain sometimes but I try to shoot it down immediately.

Shout back! Say ""I HAVE THE REST OF ME TO THINK ABOUT! I CAN'T JUST DESTROY MYSELF BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER!"" The rational side of your mind has common sense and the weight of consequence on its side. *Leverage that until it hurts*, if that's what it takes. Grap your craving self by the scruff of the neck and don't let go until it admits to the insidious nature of it's own desires. Remember what how it leaves you feeling after you've indulged that side--how all of those desires are a mountain of deceits and misbegotten drives to excess and austerity. This may be a stressful experience--doing it in a meditative environment, like a silent room of your house while alone, can be helpful for catalyzing a proper confrontation of yourself with your self-destructive shadow.

Debonaire_Death,1291589754.0,,,,t2_4l6lc,"It sounds like your life is largely on the right track, your neurochemical condition is the only thing holding you back.

I would recommend looking into low-dose amphetamines for eating disorder. There are clinicians that will prescribe for this, and I think your description fits the bill. I understand if you are worried that this will just be another addiction, but low-dose has very subtle effects that are largely anxiolytic and prevent compulsion. Amphetamines work along a different neurochemical pathway than bulimia, which has a lot of opioid activity involved, especially in the purging, which seems to be your main problem.

I've had personal experience with 5mg Vyvanse once in the morning when I had my life in order but still couldn't stop binging and purging. It gave me a life-giving 2 weeks binge and purge free after being unable to go for more than 3 days at a time, where I was really able to reduce my compulsions.

As for cognitive-behavioral approaches, it's important to train yourself to be able to grasp immediate awareness of what your underlying motives are in a situation. Practice doing it when you aren't craving, and just going about your day--just try to seize your awareness and really grip what your on about. Do this a few times a day and when the craving starts to happen, you'll be able to identify it earlier. Sometimes the bulimic part of your mind can work very sneakily in subconscious ways, even going so far as to avoid giving in to a smaller temptation because it will be an excuse to indulge in an even bigger temptation.

Start by seeking out a therapist who specializes in ED via your insurance. If you don’t like the first one, try another one. If you don’t like the second one, try another one. Putting in place the practical support for recovery is not easy, and often takes longer than it should. It’s going to take some legwork on your part and there are going to be some roadblocks, so expect that.

lavenderflore,1515555146.0,,,,t2_rf1g3o4,"Hi, recovered bulimic here.  First off all, I would talk to her first, not her husband.

Approach her gently, knowing that bulimia is a knot of shame, self hatred, and overwhelming emotions to the person dealing with it - so be prepared for a wide variety of reactions from her.   She may feel defensive (even if you're not being critical), embarrassed, or... she may feel relief to have to talk to someone about it.  In my years of bulimia I had all those reactions to various people confronting me about it at various points.

The main angle to come forward with is :  how can I help you?  Not:  I'm concerned/panicked about you and you have to get help to do something about MY concern.  (It's fine to say you're concerned but don't make it the focus - that can have a negative effect on her feeling of overwhelm.) 

I disagree with other comments here that you should mind your business, you're her friend and you have every right to talk to her about it.  A conversation may be a really positive thing for her.  But as a friend just be prepared to potentially experience some difficult emotions of your own as you continue in your friendship with her, because as much as you care, you can't force someone to get help or get better, and that can be tough,.

Absolutely do not tell the husband!! I’m so very single but the thought of that is still mortifying. Bulimia is a very secretive illness and I know many of us are sadly embarrassed by it, the two people closest to her discussing this behind her back could easily have the opposite effect and push her further away. 

You are going to need to confront her about this, don’t be angry or get emotional just be her friend. I absolutely hate talking about it with my friends and family but it’s 100x easier when I’m still talked to like I’m normal if ya get me. 

I can tell you’re really worried but if she’s functioning well enough to be on a girls holiday I highly doubt she would need to be an inpatient. I’ve done my GCSE’s, a levels and am now at uni with bulimia, it’s a pain in the arse, physically and emotionally draining but I am still living a happy life and am healthy in every other way. Some days are good some days are bad but I still get through them. 

When you talk to your friend urge her to see a doctor, I know I’m healthy but I have regular blood tests and ECG’s to keep check on this cos it can really mess with your heart and electrolyte balances. I’ve also been prescribed fluoxetine which has made a noticeable difference in both how much I purge and my mood. A doctor will also be able to refer her to the right place for further treatment, most likely CBT. Since starting this I have so much hope for the future, I used to purge up to 15 times a day but that has dramatically reduced I can even go days without purging at all!

I don't binge and purge, which is bulimia. When I am practicing my bad behaviours, I restrict what I eat and make myself throw up sometimes when I have a meal, but I don't binge eat. 

Yesterday after work I had a toasted bagel with avocado. Not a 'binge' by any means, but I still wanted to throw up because in my mind that meal had ruined my day of not eating.

So very similar to bulimia but not quite the same. But I think it's common to equate purging with bulimia.

graamatvede,1396011760.0,,,,t2_fw1no,"Hi!

Don't know if this helps, but several things that helped me stop binging:

\- Driving a car or taking a walk.

\- Buying food only for one meal (I fooled myself when buying food for more than that, also tossed out everything else at home that I would consider binging on)

\- Drinking water/coffee/cola. Staying away from binging (especially in the first weeks) is way more important than having drunk too much sugar/caffeine.

\- Avoiding people (first at home was the one place i always binged as soon as i got home, but later i got urges if i got in a fight with someone, missed a bus).

\- Planning my meals in advance - and sticking to it. As well as when I started eating - do it slowly, chew food properly and enjoy the food and sensing how I feel about eating. if the urge got stronger, I'd put the fork away and give it some time. if it got too strong, I'd put food away, since eating didn't happen for the right reasons.

\- pray. I am not religious, but i believe in higher power.

The first days were the hardest - it was like rewiring the brain to perceive food differently and I wanted to achieve ""sobriety"" from binging at any cost. I smoked a lot more, drank so much cola, was very nervous (got pissed about little things, but I knew it is my illness making any excuse to make me weak and give in) and thought about food a lot, but in the end of the day the satisfaction, pride and surprise that life CAN be different and i CAN do it was 100&amp;#37; worth it. I still avoid places that could trigger my urge - i simply leave the room if there are are triggery foods because my binge sobriety is THE most important thing.

gorgon433,1525846206.0,,,,t2_1c2rm2q6,"I don’t have a foolproof answer (I don’t think anyone does) but I can tell you things that have helped me stop binging in the past

I have no idea what your living situation is like, but I live alone. My first line of defense is to never go to the grocery store hungry, and I go shopping every weekend and only buy food for one week and I don’t buy easily bingeable foods. I also try to buy a lot of food that I need to cook, or at the very least microwave before I can eat it. This makes it harder for me to find ways to binge when I have the urge, and gives me a lot more time to talk myself out of it.

If the urge is getting too strong, and I know I’m going to make food/binge on all my fruit or something or go to the quick shop and buy a ton of shit, I call a friend. If I can make plans to hang out with people I’m a lot less likely to binge. I have a friend who lives in another state who knows about my bulimia and sometimes I call her if she isn’t at work and she talks to me and distracts me. 

If nobody can hang out and my friend can’t answer, I get a big glass of water and I turn on a tv show I’ve already seen for some background noise and I try to take a nap. If I can manage to fall asleep sometimes the urge is gone when I wake up, and I’d rather be groggy and have trouble sleeping that night than halt all of my progress.

If I do binge, I try to stop it as soon as possible by following the same steps as above. I’ve had my friend call back before and basically stop a binge halfway through. Realizing that not all is lost once you start binging and that it doesn’t have to be a 0 or 100 situation was probably the biggest and most helpful mindset change I’ve had. It’s okay to accidentally slip, but you can catch yourself before you go through the whole cycle. 

When I do binge and I’m uncomfortable and feel the physical need to purge, I take pepto and tums, and I follow the same steps above. Hanging out with friends (even though you feel like shit) really helps take away the ability to purge. I still want to, but there’s a lot less opportunity, and getting up and doing something sometimes makes me more motivated to keep my streak going.

There’s no perfect answer, but those are the things I do to make it easier for myself to be strong and keep going.

I know how scary it is to think of going inpatient. But, as much as possible, try and see it as a refuge. Don’t think that it will ‘cure’ you. It likely won’t. It’s likely going to be a very long process. But what inpatient can give you is a chance to take a break from the ED. To live just a while without it’s torment. It is a safe space.

Bulimic female here - I know what you are going through, I saw my man feel horrible and helpless, being unable to help me. But we managed through it. The best thing he did, was express his concern but let it be. It took a while for him to understand the seriousness of the illness (I was hiding it from him in the beginning, then less so, then it was all plain open), but we decided to move apart for a while - I knew he cannot help me (and neither can you, the best you can do is be there, if she needs you) and it destroyed my confidence to be around him and having him ""see"" what I am doing to myself. Only I could make the decision I want to stop living that way - only your gf can make the decision to stop hurting herself and get help. 

But, there is some ""passive"" help tips I appreciated from my man:

\- Try to have healthy boundaries, you can offer to drive her to the therapy sessions (it might be scary to admit to oneself one needs serious help, for long even if I knew I had a problem, I thought I still had it ""under control"" - I didn't), 

\- Don't offer or buy her food, let her make her own choices. 

\- Don't keep junk food at home, that's another purge waiting to happen. 

\- Research the illness (you can watch the movie ""To the Bone"" with her, let her explain her feelings) - this condition usually roots in self hatred (not necessarily bodily image alone, but the feeling of not being good enough). If she is ok with it, ask her questions that interest you (with her keeping the rights of not wanting to answer).

\- Love her. Let her know you are there for her. And don't force anything.

I'm sorry to hear this.

I don't know if this will be any helpful - but what helped me was to give my life in God's hands (not any particular religion, just a power I believe higher than myself). I let go of the control and it felt freeing.

Next step - I have 5-6 small meals every 3-4 hours, where I would have just a very small portion of something healthy - half an egg / half a cup of yoghurt / a slice of bread / 20 grams of chicken / third of a banana / 4 walnuts - those would be my meals (full of nutrients, vitamins and staying in the belly). I haven't purged since I started this and when the craving and urge comes upon, I pray, beg to God to free me from it, take a walk, drink a glass of water, and try to rewire my brain so it forgets what it means to throw up.

graamatvede,1396011760.0,,,,t2_fw1no,"Hi and welcome! I so understand you! My issues started as I quit sports, for 7 years I went to gym for fun, for the excitement, for how it made me feel, and a bit for looks, and then stopped, but ate like a weightlifter. Within a year I gained so much weight. But when I tried going back to gym, my motivation changed, I was forcing myself to lose weight and hated every minute I spent there. Later I lost weight in an unhealthy way (so I will not recommend it), but was I happy? No! The illness kicked in and I was so paranoid to get back to that high weight that purging took over. There was no such thing as skinny enough.
What really helped me was OA. Seeing how there were others who think like me and shared how they had fought the illness. It was difficult to me in the beginning to attend the real life meetings, but there are online/phone meetings as well. It really helps first, because you are not alone, I believe no textbook doctor can give as good advice as the person who has actually been through it and won! From purging up to 10 times a day is now 1 time a week and I've become more healthy, because I'm not locked inside the prison of my thoughts but have an actual plan, vision and feel calm. 
Anyhow, wish you all the best! This illness is treatable!

I cannot tell you what is the best course of action for you, I can only offer a personal anecdote.

I first stopped purging long before I could stop bingeing, then I followed a structured eating guideline I got off the Internet (I am not advertasing anything, it is just what I did), which reduced the frequency of binges, and later when that became a possibility for me I got into therapy which helped make binges (still, many years later) a very, very infrequent thing.",,,1514621152,,,dry32hs,,t3_7n0buo,,,t3_7n0buo,/r/bulimia/comments/7n0buo/hard_to_think_of_gaining_weight_as_recovery/dry32hs/,,1514621153,6,,,False,bulimia,t5_2tmc8,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",1514621153.0,,,,,,,,,,,

notnotpsycho,,,,,,"I did for probably a solid three years. It got to the point I was taking 12 or more at a time. Bulimia via laxatives controlled my life. I would say they woke me up from a dead sleep around 4 or 5am and I’d be up and down running to the bathroom well into the afternoon. This was in college at an off campus apartment complex and each room came with a bathroom- so I never had to share.. which just made things more convenient, I guess. If I had to share a bathroom I probably wouldn’t have ended up with such a huge problem. I couldn’t go anywhere or do anything until late afternoon when I knew nothing else could possibly come out. I wouldn’t eat during the day and I would go to the gym for about an hour and a half then I’d go to Taco Bell and order half the menu. Then if course, I would go home and take a box of laxatives. I missed so many classes and labs and ultimately failed a lot of them. When I returned home (to my parents’ house) for good, I couldn’t do that anymore so I would eat once a day and throw it up.. and then eventually I just quit eating-having developed full blown anorexia. And I was still running between 6 and 8 miles a day. I was put on a medication (for a completely separate issue) that made me gain well over 100lbs. All I wanted to do was eat and sleep. The massive weight gain threw me into a horrible depression and food/binge eating was there to help me cope, ironically.. so I just continued to put on more weight. I ended up weighing 290lbs. I’m a 5’3 female who’s always been active and in sports and was super focused on my body so I kind of went way in the opposite direction. My metabolism was fuuuuuckkkkked for the longest time. I was lucky to shit once a week. I think it’s still off, tbh. I’ve lost 35 so far. Thankfully I found a good antidepressant and am becoming more and more active. I intend on getting back down to around 140- which I know is going to be a lot of hard work. Currently I either heavily restrict what I eat or just eat once and a day.. and either way I take two laxatives before bed just to have a bowel movement the next day. So I’ve been all over the spectrum as far as eating disorders are concerned and I guess you could say I’m boarding one now. But yeah. If you can “quit” laxatives; you should do it.

Yeah I know that she is on the edge of a healthy weight but I know sometimes the BMI is not very accurate because it don't counts in muscle weight and on. I know this from myself, because I have a BMI between upper 18 to lower 20, changes often a bit, with that I know that I am underweight, but definitely not in a dangerous way.

I don't think so, the only time something in this way was where her stomach hurt and she thought about forcing her to vomit to feel better. But she have done it.She normaly eats a little bit less then she should (at least I think so). But she never really counts calories, she likes to eat sweets, but only at a proper meal she doesn't always eats healthy portions.

I think that this is more stress related, but I wanted to be sure, because as you say, eating disorders are serious and dangerous.

pedaling-backwards,,,,,,"I’m bad with conversions — so she’s roughly 5’3 and 100 pounds, yes? If so, that makes her teeter on the very edge of being underweight. I’m on the lower end of a healthy BMI, and my doctor has told me in the past that by being the weight that I am, it doesn’t give me much wiggle room. If I were to ever get really sick and drop 15 pounds, I’d be very underweight at that point. The same thing goes for your girlfriend.

So, onto your actual question: does your girlfriend ever voluntarily force herself to purge (vomit) after she eats? Does she ever over-exercise or go a very long time without eating anything (fasting) to make up for a big meal? Does she ever complain about calories or her body image or say that she’s fat/can’t eat certain foods?

Typically, someone who is bulimic or is showing signs of bulimia takes in a LOT of food at one time (like, way more than what a normal person should consume), and then tries to compensate for it by fasting, over-exercising, or vomiting up their food. However, even if your girlfriend doesn’t do those things, she probably isn’t bulimic but it *does not* mean she isn’t disordered. 

For a long time, I never used to vomit up my food. Instead, I would purposedly eat VERY little on some days so I could lose weight rapidly. Of course, our bodies aren’t meant to survive on so little, so after a few weeks of eating next to nothing, my body would go into panic mode and I would binge-eat and consume thousands and thousands of calories in a sitting. I would constantly think I was fat, and no matter how much weight I lost, it wasn’t enough. My official diagnosis at that point in time was EDNOS, but later on I discovered purging and it is since then been changed to Bulimia.

If your girlfriend is intrigued by eating disorders but isn’t showing many signs of disordered eating *yet,* she should try and get out while she can. Eating disorders are dangerous — people die from them, all the time. They aren’t something to be glamorized or romanticized, people get hurt from these illnesses and they CAN and most often DO ruin lives.

For 3 years I was extremely thin due to my emotional state and then restriction to stay that way. 3 more years later and I’m still battling binge eating and bulimia, which I believe is due to restricting and being very under weight for a long period of time. 

I finally told my parents, best friend, and now boyfriend because my bulimia became out of control. They believe it is a coping mechanism for me never dealing with my brother’s death properly.

The point of my comment is, I know you are in a very dark and sad place right now. I do think taking the time to mourn and deal with your emotions will really help in the long run. Kudos to going to therapy!! That is an amazing thing to do.

It releases hormones and whatever else and is kind of like an addict who gets a hit - you binge, you purge and then you feel better for a little while. I was diagnosed as bipolar too when I was younger but through dealing with my eating disorder my therapist had an ah-ha moment and realized that I am actually autistic, which granted is worse because it's not something that can be medicated. But they call annorexia the ""aspergers for women"" for a reason. We use the mechanisms of an eating disorder to cope with the overwhelming emotions caused by being on the spectrum. Something for you to look into anyway. The way to get better is of course to heal your eating disorder, and once your brain is getting better nutrition it will function better which allows you to deal with stress in a more productive way.

ByrdsandButterflies,1469512645.0,,,,t2_ztd3t,"hi &lt;3

I know this is a late response, but I hope you see this still and something resonates/is helpful for you.

First I just want to say that I really, really commend you on your desire to get better, as I see in a comment you made. I also have struggled with my ED for about 15 years, and its a difficult journey to become 100% recovered, but it is 100% possible and I think it's important to hold onto your strength, resolve, and hope for a better life throughout it as best you can, as I am learning key elements to living a healthy and fulfilling life are trust in the process of delving deep into yourself, confronting behaviors and though patterns that harm us, finding and growing self-love and -kindness  (as well as profound gratitude for every moment we have to grow and be present and experience too I think). 


But I think telling the important people in your life the truth about what your going through, about your experience would be really really really beneficial and help you recover. There are many reasons why I think it would be helpful, regardless of what your boyfriend's response would be (though I want to offer some thoughts on that that too in a little bit).


For me in my journey to recover, it has been so powerful to connect to my voice and strengthen that so I can finally speak my truths. The eating disorder voice gets quieter the more your voice develops and is used and is an advocate for your health and true happiness (partly as the ED voice only has lies and unhealthy and damaging ways to articulate and handle experiences). Why your voice is so important and matters too, is that it allows you to start being in control of constructing/authoring your narrative -the story of your life, the story about who you are and what you want and need, how you interact and treat yourself and others, and how you take what life has given you and make something that can be so amazing and beautiful and worthwhile and fulfilling from it. So whenever you speak about what's going on for you, from the surface layer of the symptoms of your eating disorder, to the depths and root and core of your soul and feelings and thoughts, this is powerful and helps strengthen and empower you. I think an ED offers a false sense of control, and it actually is truly confronting everything you have been not fully processing or running from allows you to be stronger and able to see what truly is in your control and create a life than with all the opportunities and choices you have that you no longer have to escape from with ED, but truly thrive in. 


So to answer another of your question, I think you should tell your boyfriend about your bulimia. Partners are really important people in our lives, and their support and unconditional love can be so powerful and meaningful. Try to think of things this way too - would you want your boyfriend to be able to come to you with something that he is really struggling with and to be there for him however you can? 


I hear you on not wanting to ruin your relationship, but I think it is important to put yourself out there and tell him, regardless of how he might respond. You deserve support and love and kindness and respect, and even if he won't ever understand fully - if he makes the attempt to hear you and give you space to speak, that is amazing and something I know that I want to give AND take from the people in my life closest to me - your feelings, struggles, and thoughts matter, and there are people out there who want you to be healthy and happy truly, and you deserve love and support, you truly do. 

Based on my experiences and opinion as well, ruining relationships does happen as a consequences of using bulimia/any eating disorder to cope with life, as you are hurting yourself immensely with them and destroying your health. I feel my ED tears at my very soul, and hurts my mind (not being able to think clearly or about much else than weight/food is really awful and not truly living or thriving in my opinion), heart, and body. We are risking our very lives with our ED behaviors for something that gives the illusion of happiness or peace or whatever your ED means for you personally. I have had to end toxic or harmful relationships because they didn't support my recovery from ED and my growth as a person and individual, and that was very hard and painful, but ultimately I am so thankful for everything on my journey that has helped me grow and learn what healthy is. And I am so thankful too for the people who are still in my life before, during, and after embarking on ED recovery, and I know I can better love and be there for them too wth every stride in recovery I make. 


Please know that I am sending you so many well wishes and love, and I believe in you and your strength and your ability to get better and do what you need to do in order to find and love yourself and find the people who fall in love with your true self and are there for you through hardships and joys/with all the good and the bad  &lt;3

ByrdsandButterflies,1469512645.0,,,,t2_ztd3t,"First, I just want to say thank you for your concern and desire to help and better understand, as someone who is also in a long distance relationship and is a sufferer of bulimia; 
&lt;3 Recovery/healing from an eating disorder does require a good support system and an SO can be an important part to that. 


What your girlfriend describes does sound like it *could* be bulimia; have you talked since about why she gets that urge?
If it is a way to manage feelings, than it seems very likely that it is an eating disorder. Has she talked to a medical professional about this though at all? They would be able to help figure out what's going on and get a diagnosis and then start getting a treatment plan together(though the journey to heal is in the early stages just from there I think, as there are no easy or quick fixes with an eating disorder at least). 


If it is an eating disorder, based on my experiences, I would advise you to encourage her to seek out professional help - from a therapist/counselor (particularly one that specializes in eating disorders would be really great) and a doctor and possibly a nutritionist - as it is not a healthy sign if she feels an  urge to throw up. Those are key support people who can help her start to unravel more of the why and how those urges occur. Also just your vocal and active encouragement for any healthy behaviors can be very powerful - such as if she has any creative outlets like writing or drawing etc., or a  mediation practice, or reading, or listening or playing music, knitting, etc.! 


I would also suggest that please don't think that **you** can ""save"" her. You can help her with providing love and support, but she ultimately has to save herself. If she does in fact have an eating disorder, or if it something else even, it will be a journey that will have a lot of hardship/struggle/difficult feelings and pain. Finding other ways to cope with life, other than eating disorder, will include a lot of discomfort and growing pains, but things such as journalling, talking to friends, doing art, etc. will be important and really rewarding and healthy to do. You can help celebrate her victories and growth on this journey, as well as be there for her when she needs someone to talk to and to be heard, but remember to not loose sight of taking care of yourself through this and modeling to her and any other people in your life what treating yourself with kindness and love looks like.


It can be really difficult to actively love someone, as we as humans are all so flawed. But I do think, in my opinion, it is also an added challenge to love and be in someone's life who is actively engaged in any addiction, including an eating disorder. It is painful for everyone in that person's life, for many reasons, and I just recommend that you also fall back on a good support system to make sure you can be healthy (such as talking to a therapist or a counselor about this as well, who will keep everything disclosed private).

ByrdsandButterflies,1469512645.0,,,,t2_ztd3t,"Hey there,


My ex really struggled with my purging behaviors and did tell me it was like I was cheating on them with my eating disorder. A lot of resentment, pain, and anger grew on their side, and part of why I want to 100% recover is to never risk hurting someone again like I had with my ex because of my eating disorder and its effects. 


I think my ex didn't really understand my eating disorder. As, like you, I was not trying to intentionally betray them when I used binging and purging to cope with life. There were a lot of problems with our relationship, but I do think one of the biggest was that they misunderstood and misinterpreted me a lot, and I was so used to just using my eating disorder to cope, I could not articulate what I truly needed and wanted and stand up for myself better.  



I am in a relationship now and while I have disclosed my eating disorder to them soon after I first met them, I was behavior free for months then; I recently relapsed though and I have let them know, but I do put a lot of energy in hiding my behaviors and feel extremely guilty and like a let down. I feel awful about returning my eating disorder- as it does make me less present, available, and able to be the partner I want to be, and part of myself is so wrapped up in my eating disorder that takes so much energy and hope and life from me. I don't want to have anything to hide from them/from the world really though, so trying to grow from this relapse and get better. 


But just some thoughts; I don't know if my perspective helped at all, but sending you and your S.O. love and well wishes and hope too that you find healing and growth and happiness  &lt;3.

My big deterrent from purging now is the fact that I know I'm ruining my teeth and burning the lining of my throat which could lead to throat cancer. Not to mention that it just makes me hungrier again and I have to eat again. 

I temper myself now with telling my S.O., who helps distract me from the urges and reminding myself that weight loss is all cumulative. If I eat a lot this meal, then I just have to eat less at the next one or work out for a bit (I usually bike ride or rock climb). Little victories are when I have a busy day and don't eat as much (I do eat during the day) and the next day the number on the scale goes down. Not sure if this is healthy or not...

PsychadelicSpaceCat,1512966603.0,,,,t2_83ep3t5,"(TW to others besides OP for purging talk)

Hi friend. I had my wisdom teeth out in June and went through this same struggle. It definitely sucks. I think I managed to go a week before purging, and it was terrifying, but things ended up ok. No infections or dry sockets after that.

After the week post-surgery with no purging, I felt bold enough to purge a few times a week (below normal for me at the time). That went on for a couple weeks. Then I was back to regular ED behaviors after about 4 weeks. Never needed to go back to the dentist for anything. I feel like I got really lucky, I could easily have given myself an abscess or something. 😖

My advice would be to follow your post-op care plan religiously, with whatever rinses and medicines they gave you. If you do end up purging, just make sure you use saline rinse after, and try to treat your mouth gently the rest of the day. Are you worried about people's opinions  of your post-op foods? Oral surgery is pretty common and most people know how it makes you sore/limits your diet. And try not to torture yourself with the scale! Your mouth's health is the most important thing these next few weeks. 

Do whatever you can to keep yourself from purging, but if you do, follow your post-op care plan and things will be ok. ❤️ hoping for a fast recovery!",True,0.0,1537120029,,0.0,e631ols,False,t3_9gc947,1.0,True,t3_9gc947,/r/bulimia/comments/9gc947/just_got_oral_surgery/e631ols/,1994.0,1539119770,2,,True,False,bulimia,t5_2tmc8,public,,1537120299.0,,[],,text,False,,r/bulimia,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",,,,,,,,,,,,

bigstupidlete,1527471023.0,,,,t2_1gi96fbo,"Okay. Again you don’t have to listen to me. This is just my opinion and what I have learned from my own experience with an ED/depression/anxiety and what has helped me. Most doctors are not going to help. Not because they don’t care, not because they won’t try, but because they don’t know how to. They don’t have the personal experience and perspective to understand how incredibly complex these things are. Their education is not to be snuffed at, and that is not what I’m doing. It is just that they are taught that depression etc is often a result of a chemical imbalance, and that medication can reslove it.  It is just not that simple.  Whilst medication can sometimes help and I do believe that it can offer temporary (and by that I mean a couple of years) relief of  symptoms there is not a lot of evidence to suggest that it will not permanently ‘fix’ anything. I have consumed an enormous amount of information regarding the effects and benefits of pharmaceutical intervention, because it was the therapy I was prescribed by many doctors. Many different medications, lots of professionals. I took this very seriously too, I was not flippant about it. This is what they are taught. Their whole professional lives. I am not against doctors. I just believe they dont necessarily have the correct information.  Much of the literature shows that improving a persons sleep patterns for example have a more beneficial effect than antidepressants. And sleep is just one of many, many things that need fixing in an anxious/depressed person. I’m not saying that alone will do it, it won’t.  Mood disorders are a complex beast. They do not exist on their own. There are often many contributing factors.  We are emotional, fragile beings (humans). Think of it like this: when we are born, our emotinal armor is strong and in tact. It is whole, strong, and resilient. Throughout our life, our armor sustains damage. Sometimes it can be from one/a few hugely traumatic experiences - but often this is not the case. More often, it happens gradually. Perhaps shame from being in trouble with your family*chink*. Perhaps we get teased one day *chink*. A hurtful comment from someone we love *chink*. A sense of betrayal from someone we trusted *chink*. Feeling humiliated *chink* and again *chink*. And so on and so on we have negative experience, after negative experience. There may be hundres of positive ones there too, but they don’t mend the damage of the bad ones. The damage to your armor builds and accumulates and along the way we develop coping mechanisms. Some work, some don’t. Until you get to the pont where your armor has so many chinks in it, so much damage, that it doesn’t protect you at all. Things that once you may have been able to cope with, you can’t this time. There is no strength, no resilience left. You are raw, and exposed and incredibly vulnerable. The things that used to help you cope like your ED don’t work anymore. They have gotten beyond your control. They contribute to the trauma and pull you further down. Hope fades. Hope that you will feel better, that life won’t always be this bad fades. How will you make it through life like this? It hurts too much. The pain is unbearable, and it’s not that you want to die, but simply because you can’t stay the way you are. It isn’t an option. Hope fades until it is gone. So what do you do? You ask for help, but are given a tablet. You plead with someone, anyone to take it away. You do what your told, and you really try, but it doesn’t work *chink*. How do you repair your armor? Can it ever be done? Do you even want to? It takes a long time. A very long time. It will require so much introspection. So much strength that you don’t think you have, but you do. Can therapists help you do this? The right ones can, absolutely. You may go through a few until you find ‘the right one’ you might never find them. But you MUST know you have the ability to heal yourself. You can make your armor strong again. It is not easy, it is not fast. It is a gradual process just as the process of its destruction was. You must acknowledge that your have contributed to your own harm, but are NOT solely responsible for it.  Learn as much as you possibly can about your condition. Whether that be through reading, watching videos, listening to audio - whatever suits you. Know that you will learn things that contradict each other. Find what is true for you, things will resonate with you - follow them. Try to understand your pain, your distress. You were not born with it, you have experienced it. Look for beautiful things I life, seek them out. Anything that brings you joy, no matter how trivial it may seem. It is hard not to drown in the pettiness and awful things in the world, of which there are so many. So many. It is hard not to let them damage you. But that is not all there is. There are amazing things, and good people. So many. Understand that the hateful are hurt and damaged in their way and take it out on others. Try to understand people’s motivations - why they may do things or act certain way. Be empathetic even if others aren’t. You can find peace from these horrid, awful feelings. You can feel joy and peace again. Forgive yourself. Forgive others, even the ones that don’t deserve it. Don’t let them damage you.  Learn as much as you can about yourself, the good and the bad. It is not easy. Learn as much as you can about others. About everything. Know you can’t change what has happened to you, or how you have been hurt. But also know you can heal yourself. You have the ability to make yourself better. It will be gradual. You will come up against challenges and set backs, but don’t give up. You can’t. Find what works for you, we are all so very different. It will be hard work, but you have more strength that you will ever know. You dont have to take my advice. Just know I give it to you with love. I understand how it feels, and I hope you can find peace from this all. I hope you find joy. It seems so unlikely, but it can happen. You CAN do it. Hope isn’t gone. Good luck 🖤.

Maybe a metabolic disturbance? The body may have yet not realized you stopped inducing vomit. Talk to your doctor In a way that you can get concrete answers. Make him say clearly if he is 100% sure that there's no other cause alongside the psychological factor. He's a doctor and he will know a lot better than anyone here.

Sophthe_loaf,1533261439.0,,,,t2_1weol3zh,"I totally feel u. I had to go home from college and live with my parents again due to how consumed I was by my bulimia and drug addiction.
When my parents found out about my bulimia I was so humiliated but I knew I couldn’t stop and was terrified. I wanted help, I just didn’t know how to ask for it beforehand. So I just let my therapist kinda guide a session (which we had planned out a bit beforehand) and let her gently explain basically everything while I just sat with my head down. 
She explain treatment options and my parents were down to support me. They knew something was wrong, 
it was obvious that I wasn’t myself, they just didn’t know what exactly it was. 
My parents tried to understand, which obviously they simply couldn’t as they have never lived under the control of addiction. However, they wanted to help me so badly. They came to family education days when I was in inpatient treatment, attended therapy and psychiatrist appointments, and did research online. 
I am not better now, but as they have learned and listened their insight and understanding is SO MUCH DEEPER. It’s really amazing, and has made things incredibly better for me at home. They still have their own serious issues with emotions that they still refuse to address, but having them a part of my recovery has really helped me to make the progress that I have. They motive me to keep trying when I fall down again and I don’t feel as alone in this anymore. 
Keeping my bulimia a secret was literally eating me up inside, I was broken and hopeless. I didn’t think they cared, which was light years from the truth. As a prisoner to my mind, I believed I was different and separate from these people who had raised me and loved me for the last 20 years. My bulimia didn’t want me to believe that though, it told me they would be repulsed by my behavior and probably disown me and ban me from family events. 
Breaking free from that urge to hide has shown me that I’m not actually that different from them or anyone else, and allowed me to connect.
A phrase I’ve heard often throughout my time in therapy is “Connection is the opposite of depression.” And this has helped me to deal with so much more than I could have handled myself.

hyggewithit,1490275442.0,,,,t2_16fitj,"A caution about appearance:

Part of healing from bulimia is getting off a cycle of restricted eating. For many, weight gain comes with that.

If your girlfriend senses you highly value her CURRENT weight and looks, she may continue to restrict to maintain that body to please you (among other reasons). Restricted eating often comes from the belief that thinness is one of the most important things we can attain.


Focus significantly on other things you value &amp; love about her. Her mind, her gifts, her initiative, her kindness, etc etc. 

Further, look.at your own life and where you might be showing that female bodies are important to you. I'm not trying to shame you here nor am I saying you do this, but if you comment on women being hot, stop. If you're following hot female models, celebs, etc on IG, stop. Again, if you aren't doing this or things like this, I'm not trying to attack you, but rather asking you to consider where you might be inadvertently reinforcing an environment of valuing a woman's body for its visual utility to you.

You're a great bf for caring: your empathy will go a long way. :)

alyssahall,1523293764.0,,,,t2_jan11yf,"Hey 👋🏻 sorry to hear about your situation. I’m a recovering bulimic only for about a month now after 10 years of struggling with eating disorders. My fiancé is the only man I’ve ever been open about it with so I totally understand your situation. He could have wrote this post himself! He makes me feel amazing, compliments me daily, buys me anything I want or need, basically dedicates his life to making me happy and has done that since I have known him. I think the best advice I can give is to not be down on yourself when she has an episode. Everything your doing is correct and you seem like an amazing boyfriend like mine, but it doesn’t *always* have to do with you. Please remember this. there are triggers, hers may be different than mine. I have Anxiety and it’s a vicious reoccurring cycle. She probably isn’t telling you about how many times she throws up because it’s a very secretive disease. The cycle pretty much goes like this, 

Trigger- Could be fighting with a parent, someone mentioning her weight/build, commenting on how much she eats, having a craving for unhealthy food or having unhealthy food in the house (don’t do any of these things lol) 

-&gt; Bulimic episode of binge eating than purging. 

If she tells you that she is purging you should buy her some antacids and coconut milk to replenish her electrolytes. A Gatorade will do. Make sure it’s low cal because she won’t wanna put more calories into her body for the rest of the day.

Than comes shame-depression. She’s probably moody after an episode because of a combo of insecurity and feeling shitty. You need to just hang in and make her feel good. 

She drinks a lot because it curbs her appetite. She’s now starving and feels like absolute shit. The alcohol helps. I like drinking after an episode as well. If she’s starving and it’s early in the day and she just threw up she could relapse again because of how hungry she is but how afraid she is to eat. 

You can not expect her to tell you every detail, and you can’t fight with her about it. All it will do is trigger it more. All you can do is support her and it seems like she’s already helping herself by going to therapy which is great. I still have not been able to do that so she’s on a pretty good path. You seem like your being a great support system and all you can do now is know the disease. It’s not gonna go away easy. It’s like being an addict. She may struggle your whole life and it’s something you need to be willing to deal with. Good luck to you both and I hope I helped.

hoboflaps,1419823049.0,,,,t2_kdhh9,"Yay!! Recovery is super fucking hard! I felt like the second two weeks was the toughest because “oh my god why isn’t this better yet?”  I’m only 6/7 weeks in but it got a lot better this fortnight. I also started overweight (morbidly obese) and exercises down to okay/overweight (I have a lot of loose skin and muscle) so my fear is also regaining the weight. 

To answer your questions:
- I still exercise. I got an activity tracker and set myself the goal of 10000 steps. That’s all I do. Sometimes it’s the elliptical, sometimes is a walk. I add in some moderate weights as well for my bones (3 or 4 different exercises, 3 sets of 10). It’s like the middle ground for me. I also have a habit of “binging” on exercise. 
— I fluffed around with structured eating plans vs intuitive eating. I learnt that I don’t have an internalised scaffold of my own nutritional needs so my intuitive eating was very much emotional eating. I am sticking to a structured eating plan now, and slowly my body is retraining hunger and satiety cues. It took about 2 weeks of being pretty faithful to the plan. One quote on this board was helpful for me when I got hungry “the next meal is only 1 hour away” and I could hold on. I’m always at about 6/10 or 7/10 full, and it’s a lot of effort to surf the urge to feel 11/10 full. 
— I include trigger foods in my plan in moderate amounts. 1 biscuit/cookie and some fruit and tea for afternoon snack for example. 
— recovery tips- staying faithful to a structured eating plan - my body debloated and is starting to feel more even keeled. Sticking to my psychotherapy. Increasing meditation and internal reflection. tuning into my changing physiological sensations. drinking a duck ton of water and flavoured teas. No sodas. Reduced salt. Extra hot drinks (tea with milk) for comfort. Eat foods you actually like in taste and how they make you feel. when you panic about eating too much and feeling too full and start feeling that crazy feeling of rapid expansion, lie on your bed on your stomach and distract yourself with YouTube for 10 minutes.

I ended up taking about 8 to 10 a day, various types just to get something moving. It's a vicious cycle and frankly terrifying to think you'll br taking them forever just to be normal.

I was taking them, in increasingly large doses for 2.5 years. I have recently been lax free for just about a month. I'm certainly not back to normal but I certainly have a BM atleast once a day and it's as close to normal I've been for ages.

The way I weaned myself off them was very uncoventional and quite gross but I will go into details anyway. Stop reading now if you're grossed out by this sort of thing.

I took an unholy amount of orlistat and ate a very high fat diet for a week. I maintained my exercise routine to try and offset some of the guilt from such a high fat diet but it was terrifying. The amount of fat that I was not digesting was such a volume that I was going for BM about 6 times a day and with very little warning. I think the oil in my bowel was essentially acting as a lubricant/laxative alone. That week without using stimulant laxatives gave my body enough time to get back to normality without having the usual bloating and constipation (and pain!) that is usually accompanied by lax withdrawal.

I've since resumed my normal diet and exercise, lost the weight I gained without any extra effort (took about 2 weeks). I think I gained about 5lb in total.

I know all that sounds easier said than done, but it's mostly about doing the exact opposite of whatever your ED tells you to do. For example, for years my ED told me to restrict/starve all day. Of course at some point my biology would take over and make me binge, which would lead me to purge. So, I started forcing myself to eat regularly throughout the day, everyday. I felt a huge difference in the first week in the intensity of binge urges.

ThatOnePotential,1538794356.0,,,,t2_29lcj3r3,"I'm really sorry you are struggling. I know this is difficult to accept, but you cannot recover and still be trying to restrict and lose weight--those things are mutually exclusive in my experience. I spent many years in quasi-recovery trying to be a weight my ED thought was acceptable, but that mean limiting food amounts and types, which always lead to binges and purges. I had to accept that bulimia and restriction were not helping me control my weight--at a certain point no matter what I did I could not lose weight anymore.

Because you are trying to recover on your own, I would suggest you expose yourself to any recovery stories you can find on blogs, podcasts, or YouTube. Be careful about other people claiming to be recovered but also practicing quasi-recovery (it usually involves cutting out whole food groups and/or overexercising).  

A few suggestions I would make are Ladle by Ladle, Daphne Fisher, Tabitha Farrar, Follow the Intuition, and Damn the Diets on YouTube. You might also want to read the information on the [edinstitute.org](https://edinstitute.org) to help you understand what is happening physiologically, and check out the Brain Over Binge podcast, blog, and books.

ThatOnePotential,1538794356.0,,,,t2_29lcj3r3,"Like the other commenters, stopping early would have really saved me a lot of anguish. I lost friends, and never really learned to socialize because I spent years alone with my ED. I felt terrible because my electrolytes were off, my eyes were always bloodshot and dry, my skin was constantly dry and flaky, my sleep was terrible, and I started getting random chest pains. I've lost 3 teeth, had a lot of expensive dental work (crowns, root canals, etc), and my teeth remain extremely sensitive.

On top of all of this, the ED really did a number on my mental health. I was severely depressed for most of my life, and I suspect a lot of it had to do with my brain being severely malnourished (despite being normal weight during most of this). It's not like I'm never sad now, but my lows are way less severe.

All this to say, you might want to seriously consider taking steps to stop now. As u/PsychadelicSpaceCat said, try eating balanced meals for a few days without purging and you will really be amazed how much easier it is to dismiss urges to binge and purge. Try your best not restrict as much as possible--not amounts or types of foods. 

You can get better. It is possible. I spent \~20 years with ED behavior and have been in recovery for the past year with no relapses. I truly wish someone could have warned me about what I was in for when I first started.

You need to just live day by day. You can’t expect to get over bulimia so easily. It’s almost as addictive as heroin. You need to just learn your triggers to binging and fight your urges. This won’t completely stop you from binging but it WILL help you. 

Another thing you can do is create a weight loss meal plan. Make sure to make it flexible though since the more strict it is, the more likely you will resort to your old ways.

NaturalAssistant,1540115375.0,,,,t2_2g8tz3tn,"I used to sneak out as a teen after meals, into one of our fields (we lived in the country) and puke my dinner up, then bury it. It happened so often that one day, when I was outside with my siblings playing, my brother wondered what all the weird rotting piles were....so humiliating. There were literally over 50 vomit piles, poorly covered with pine needles and leaf litter, dotted about beneath the treelines.

I get it, it's awful. The shame, the secrecy, the lying. Recovery is worth the effort even just to stop with those scenarios, sneaking away and doing weird things so you can purge safely. I've been dealing with bulimia personally for years and years and years. It really ingrains itself into our core the longer we suffer and engage in the behaviours/cycle, it's extremely difficult to stop, especially alone. The loneliness of the disease bothers me more than the actual purging/binging.
But it doesn't have to stay that way. You CAN get better, you have to start by making the difficult choice of telling someone. Be it a parent, friend, therapist or support group, find someone and keep them in the loop, ask for help. It's a cycle of anxiety that triggers eating, which triggers binging, then purging, then release...in other words it's an addiction as much as it's a mental illness. You should treat it as both, starting with being kind to yourself. I believe you can beat this animal!! On the days where it feels like bulimia is part of you, know that you're not it and you have the ability to attain your freedom, it just doesn't come easy, nothing hard ever does but it's worth it.

PsychadelicSpaceCat,1512966603.0,,,,t2_83ep3t5,"Hello friend. Anniversaries with your ED are strange aren't they? After my first year with bulimia I felt the exact feelings you wrote here. No major downsides, no rapid weight loss a.k.a. no one swooping in to get you into treatment, and without that outside pressure it's 1000x harder to start your recovery...even if you might want to badly at times...because finding it within yourself feels like ""giving up"" or losing willpower. It's really hard and lonely. I'm sorry you're stuck in this spot, and I'm glad you have a couple friends you can trust for support.

Now that I'm going on 5 years of bulimia, I wish so much that I had gotten help around the spot where you are. That's not to say it was possible, but I still wish it. At year one I was controlling my weight easily and I felt like I was in control of bulimia. I didn't start losing my hair until 18 months or so, but let me tell you, after almost 3 years of hair loss there's very little left and it's still falling. I'll probably use special sensitive toothpaste for the rest of my life because of permanent enamel loss. I have no friends left, I've pushed them all away when they challenged my disorder. My marriage is less than a year old and already strained and cold.

I'm not trying to scare you by saying all this. Your body is unique and will react and adapt differently than anyone else's. But I'm scared and sad to imagine you having to go through these things, because I feel like no one warned me...so I want to at least warn you. There might be very little reason to attempt recovery now, which makes sense. As you say nothing bad has happened. And I'm guessing your disorder fills a very real need in your life, whether it's protection or control or relieving anxiety. You're doing the best you can right now. But you could wake up years down the road and wish things had gone differently. That's really all I can say.

I encourage you to continue reading up on the side effects of purging and disordered eating in general. Try to imagine what it would feel like to develop those side effects, and use that as motivation to take small steps toward recovery, if you can. Try to have a few days a week where you focus on nourishing yourself. Protein or meal replacement shakes have personally helped me a lot. They don't feel as scary as food, they're quick and easy, and they're full of stuff your body needs. In treatment my nutritionist used to tell me that if you can go 3 days eating balanced meals without purging, you'll find the mental fog lifts and resisting the b/p urges becomes much easier. I've definitely found that to be true. It's tough, but it can get easier the more and more you push through.

There is this forum and we're all here for you.

Take it one single day at a time. If you purge 5 times a day, aim for 4. If it takes a year to get it down one number, remember any step, even a small step, is still progress to rehabilitation.

Also, please, please please.... remember that failure one day does not mean you have to give up. Just because you have a few bad days and leap back into your habits even if you've been clean for a few days doesn't mean its over and you're back at square 1.

ThatOnePotential,1538794356.0,,,,t2_29lcj3r3,"I've been in recovery for the past year after \~20 years of engaging in ED behavior. Once I started eating regularly, and not trying to restrict any food or limit my intake, the binge urges and therefore the purge urges died out pretty quickly. I realized that I was always making the mistake of ""starting a diet"" (i.e. restricting or straight out starving) every day and being so insane with hunger that I'd binge and binge for hours at night, which would lead to purging. 

I'm not saying it was super easy, as the restrict--&gt;binge--&gt;purge cycle was essentially life long habit. At first, I would practice just sitting after a regular-size meal with a timer on for 1 hour and waiting out the urge to binge, usually by distracting myself with journalling or meditation. When the alarm when off I'd realize that the urge was usually gone. If it was still there, I'd allow myself to eat a little more and set the timer again. 

As you seem to already know, as long as you are feeding yourself regularly and enough the urges to binge are way, way less severe. I don't know if this helps, but that was my strategy in the beginning. Good luck in your journey &lt;3

Like you, I spent countless family meals completely freaking out about eating and planning to purge, instead of focusing on the people around me. You don't really realize how much you were missing out on until you stop ED behavior. Then you're like, ""Oh my God, I've wasted all this time focusing on shit that *doesn't* matter.""

You must surrender the idea that you can change your body weight and size long term. It's never going to happen. We can suppress it temporarily but then will eat reactively (binge) and consequently purge, and likely end up heavier than when we started this behavior. Sorry to be bleak, but the only two options are to recover or resign yourself being miserable until you die. That's it.

I know this sounds awful, but recovery is so freeing. You can actually be present in your life. I hope you are inspired by your experience to take steps toward recovery.

ThatOnePotential,,,,,t2_29lcj3r3,"I know how you feel; I've engaged in ED behaviors for most of my life (\~21 years)--for the majority it's been a combination under-eating, over-exercising, and bulimia. I definitely used my ED behaviors as a coping mechanism, and truly thought it was ""useful"" to me.

However, I got to the point (where it sounds like you might be) where I started to see how much time and energy I was wasting everyday keeping it up. I also got to the point where no matter now much I restricted, exercised, and purged I could not get my body to lose weight like in the past. I was having to do more and more extreme behaviors to get modest ""results"". Plus, like you, I was exhausted and couldn't focus on the parts of my life that actually were working. 

So, I decided to experiment with true recovery; this was the only way I could convince myself to start. I told myself that I would, for 21 days, start eating regular meals every 3 or 4 hours (without limiting food types and making sure it was a reason portion) and see what would happen. 

It was scary, but I knew that all the other ways I had tried to recover in the past hadn't worked, and were usually just new diets and ways to restrict. In the first week, I could see that feeding myself regularly really helped diminish the urges to binge. Even when they did come up, they were pretty weak and I could just distract myself until they passed. It was like a miracle--when I started I was basically purging everyday, usually multiple times a day.

Long story (sort of) short, I've been in true recovery for the past 8.5 months. It has not been a bed of roses, by any stretch, but a lot of the things I thought were just me--severe depression and anxiety--are *way* less bad. I truly believe my brain was unable to operate correctly for most of my life because it was undernourished. 

Things that have keep me going have been (almost compulsively) listening to, reading, and watching recovery stories. Do this really has helped me realize that recovery is possible, even for someone who has been as sick as me. Reading and posting here and on r/fuckeatingdisorders has been really helpful as well.

cinnamon-sama,,,,,t2_fi026z5,"I developed anorexia at the age of 14 and a few years later after recovery my ED came back as bulimia, although I haven't ever purged, only exercised off the calories. But I can relate so much because I feel the same way. I exercised compulsively and I gave it priority over anything else and since I spent so much time on it I wouldn't get much else done. Although I managed to limit my exercise to 1h a day. However, the feeling of lack of control over what I eat and my life overall causes me so much anxiety. The persistent thoughts about food also make me feel sick and I just wish I could have a healthy relationship with food. I don't want to hate it but I don't want to love it either. I wish I could eat simply because it's needed and not to find comfort on it (anxiety made me an avid emotional eater). So I'm also struggling to recover, if that's even possible. Sometimes I think my ED is so rooted to my mind I will only be able to learn to ignore it. But even that would be good enough. I'm 21 now and I'd hate to see my future self hiding food from my husband or having anxiety attacks because I didn't exercise one day.

Since I've never purged, I may not be able to understand you completely but feel free to message me if you need help or just a distraction when you feel the urge to purge. We could try to encourage each other and help us to make healthy choices when our ED impulses tries to take control.

As for sticking out, just think if someone else in your class was dancing in the way you ""stuck out,"" would you have noticed it, or judged them, or cared? Probably not... If yes, even if they came back to the next class better than they were before? Etc. Any dancing ability you might have lost can be regained, probably quicker than you think. It's just a matter of what your muscles are used to doing, it will take a couple practices/classes -- You'll snap back into it as you keep going...

I did, not after I was doing treatment, but I've stopped dancing during a season of binging and I felt so disgusting... I had put on weight and lost flexibility and when I started again I was so ashamed of myself (side-note, looking at pictures of that time, the weight gain wasn't nearly as big a deal as I thought; people in your class probably think nothing of it, and if you keep moving in a healthy way your body will reshape). After a while of dancing I reclaimed my body and actually became a much better dancer. And I wish I would have kept dancing then, and not just stopped going again when I felt the ED stuff kick back in. Because I eventually stopped and was sick again -- and now after a year off, I have to get back in shape for a show I'm in. And I'm kicking myself for not staying with it; I'd be so much farther right now. It's rough to think of, but I love to dance, so I'm practicing at home, trying old routines, going lightly with the stretching, putting on music and moving to it.

 Anyway I hope you keep going to class!!

cyungz,1544475268.0,,,,t2_risf0aj,"I didn’t get outted because they hired an outside plumbing agency, and I rent my apartment through a reality company so they have a lot of other apartments and houses to manage. My building is also an older house converted into two apartments, so they could have just factored in the pipes being older, and being more prone to blockage over the years. Now with that being said, if it was a reoccurring instance they would probably look more into it and I probably wouldn’t be so lucky. 

The problem with puking in toilets or sinks is that our purged food isn’t entirely broken down, and it is very acidic, unlike our digested food. Plumbing pipes are not meant to handle that, and can break down over time from the acid, or get clogged with sludge over time of vomit/undigested food building up. Of course when it’s not frequent (throwing up when drinking, being sick, etc) it’s not so much and issue, but when we purge multiple times a day everyday, it really takes a toll. 

It is not ideal but I have resorted to puking in the bags since then, and have had no problems. It sucks, honestly. Especially given the convenience factor of doing it in a toilet or shower, but long term it is better than the potential consequences of destroying the plumbing.

My lying went on for 4 years and I recently just opened back up to them that I wasnt recovered and my bulimia was as bad as ever. Now no one that hasn't experienced an ED first hand will understand. One thing I've learned is to not expect support iN a certain way, not expect reactions bc I have no idea how others will react or how they truly feel/ think of this bc they havent experienced an Ed but that being said, my family knowing makes such a difference in my daily life and in my recovery. I buy and cook my own meals butt my mom always watches, not over bearingly but watches what I eat and if she notices a bit of a binge she'll interrupt it. She watches out for me and doesn't buy some of my trigger foods as much but still does to feed the rest of my family but also, aside for her stopping a binge, since my family knows so much I feel like if I purge they'll know and its shameful to me. I feel like I'll get caught bc they're always observant of it and when they find out they'll confront me and I just dont want to deal w that but that really prevents me from purging.

throwaway862153,1534093489.0,,,,t2_1yzqdj17,Hey I was prescribed adderall thinking it would help with my bingeing and purging seven years ago. Immediately after starting it my binges decreased from multiple times a day to 2 per week. But this only lasted 2 months and then the appetite suppressant effects wore off as my body got accustomed to the medication. I got sicker than ever after that. I have all sorts of negative symptoms from it now. I have constant anxiety and nausea and terrible brain fog that never lifts and a lot more. I can't sleep at all ever. But I can't come off of it. I've managed to recover despite this but the withdrawal from this medication is so terrible that I've relapsed every attempt I've made to decrease my dose. ADHD medication is not a solution. I'm almost in tears right now because I would give anything to never have started it and I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake that I did. ,,,1547743057,,,eea678k,,t3_agvvg4,,True,t3_agvvg4,/r/bulimia/comments/agvvg4/vyvanse_elvanse_prescription/eea678k/,,1547743058,1,,True,False,bulimia,t5_2tmc8,,,,,[],,text,,,,False,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",1547743058.0,,,,,,,,,,,

The thing is once that wore off it was horrible, I would be hungrier than I was in the first place. To top it all off I was being charged $375 a month for it. There are ways to help with binge eating disorder that do not involve spending huge amounts of money and destroying your body. Vyvanse works with binge eating disorder the same way cocaine works with binge-eating disorder. I was on Vyvanse for 5 years, I was lucky I lost my job when I quit taking Vyvanse so I could lay in bed for 6 days wanting to die while I detoxed from it.

SweetShame,,,,,t2_tb7l7p2,"I can relate so much re: bulimia relapse. The guilt that comes with eating can be too much sometimes.  
The binging is a part of the healing, which is flipping annoying and yes I cry too. When I get into the frenzy I try focusing on healthy foods regardless if all I'm craving is junk. That way it's still going to be of benefit to my body in some way. Even though at the time can't stand the feeling of food in my stomach... it's like a ticking time bomb. Distracting yourself is great too once you've had a meal. Getting out of the house, getting in the company of people even though you mind tells you to isolate.   
Tomorrow is a new day. 

You are beautiful, you are loved, your body is beautiful, your scars do not define who you are and neither does your eating disorder.

Hamanth,,,,,t2_1o76d5wg,"I've been chalking it up to keeping food in my body and the energy it's taking to digest my meals is making me fatigued more frequently if I am not on a proper schedule. (Im bad for skipping breakfast, and sometimes lunch). I get extremely tired after eating a lot of carbs, (I slept for 3 hours after eating lasagna tonight) or when I'm eating a big (average  amount to some others) meal Im exhausted afterwards. If I skip a meal during the day, usually my dinner is something hearty now because I'm home with my family more often, but it's usually spaghetti, meat and potatoes, etc, which makes me want to call it a night on the couch at 6pm haha. While going through my periods of b/p, I consumed a lot of coffee and energy drinks through the day, and now I've cut back drastically (1 sm/med coffee maybe every 2-4 days, no energy drinks) on my caffeine intake as well, and I've quit smoking so I think a lot of things that were keeping me energized and anxious have now been cut out, and my body is just trying to play catch up now for what it's been lacking when I've been depriving it and b/p. 

I'm just speaking from my own personal experience, and that may not even be the case for everyone or anyone, but through the process of elimination - (unless I have some unknown condition, but bloodwork has been normal) - and becoming more aware of my body and how I feel afterwards has pushed me in the direction that skipping meals and not engaging in b/p activity, and then eating bigger meals while my body is already deprived of nutrients is using a lot of energy that i haven't given myself, but I'm not a doctor. This also helps keep me mentally on track with eating regularly because I'm not wanting to deny myself of the nourishment and energy I need to function properly and be alert for my school and job. 

My advice is if medical issues are rules out, try to look at your lifestyle and how you're treating yourself (your diet, physical health, having a proper sleep schedule, possible stress, engaging in self-care, high demanding career) from the outside in, and maybe something will eventually stand out, and help connect your fatigue to every day life. Once there's a cause, there's a solution, and even if you don't discover the cause of the fatigue, it may help you to generate some more positive skills along the way and help in another area of your life. 

Keep up the good work, it's easy to fall back into bad habits and where we're comfortable at, but to resist the urges and begin to deal with coping and recovery is an amazing feat. One day at a time. 
Wishing you the best of luck &lt;3

In recovery, I’ve tried to white knuckle my way through being around binge foods and situations, telling myself that if I really wanted to get better, the food or the situation shouldn’t matter. But that’s not true. Honestly: if my house contains desserts, candy, bread, prepackaged meals, or fatty snacks, I will binge! And then purge. So I eventually just stopped keeping them at home. If someone gives me them as a gift, I either regift the item or throw it out privately. I still eat those things, just only out in public with others, and in single meal portions. That way I’m not deprived, but I’m also not in danger.

willifreemyself,,,,,t2_3bf1itw4,"Towards Eating Habits/ ""Control""
Week 1: Horrific, for example I would eat breakfast and at 11 am would be thinking soo much about food that my mind would go crazy. 
I knew I had to eat because my brain still had no clue it was ALLOWED the ""forbidden"" food in a ""forbidden"" quantity at a ""forbidden"" time. I dont want to mention calories but it ended up being double or triple the amount of what my ED told me to eat. The guilt and shame was unbelievable intense but I knew I had to continue eating all my meals and snacks. It was never as much food as a full blown b/p cycle but I would end up feeling bloated and full, sweating during the night from my metabolism kicking in again. 
Week 2: i started noticing my first ""good"" days. By this I don't mean a low calorie ""ED voice"" day,  but a day where I didn't binge or felt bloated and didn't THINK OF FOOD as much. Something regardless of how much I ate would never ever happen when I was sick. I ALWAYS thought of food, because to me I had no control over it. I had really bad days too don't get me wrong but they became lighter and less frequent.
Week 3: The first thing that happened was that my Recovery Euphoria started to fade away and my Eating Disorder Voice and especially body Image Voice became stronger and stronger. I noticed I had gained a little bit of weight around my stomach, which is typical after restricting because your body wants to protect the organs. 
But because of my coping skills and my self esteem kicking back in I started to ignore it. Whatever my Eating Disorder would tell me, I tried to to the opposite. (which ended up being eating vs. not eating :D) . I almost didn't care because It felt so good that I finally started to let go of the Bulimia Mindset and I could concentrate on other things .

I told her “you know how much I’ve hated myself &amp; unhappy I’ve been every time I’ve gained a lot of weight. Thank you so much for thinking of me &amp; bringing me goodies, but please stop or bring less”. The first time she answered “put them in your freezer”.  This really triggered me because i had just made a promise not to purge anymore. I told her “Mom, you don’t bring a drug addict drugs &amp; tell them to put them in their freezer, so please don’t bring me sweets &amp; expect me to do the same.” This really put things into perspective for her &amp; it’s really helped. 
Now to your situation —&gt; tell your parents that you’ve gained a significant amount of weight since you’ve been living with them &amp; have been fed so well. Make sure they know how much you appreciate it &amp; aren’t complaining at all, but gaining this weight makes you feel self conscious &amp; you would really appreciate making some changes. From there it opens up the opportunity to discuss &amp; figure out how to eradicate the situation without putting you in the position to go back into the dark habit of purging. I’ve also learned that telling people (work people for me, but this could also be your family if they still don’t understand) that you feel sick if you eat 3 times a day because your stomach can not handle that much food. My digestive system is almost trained to be “sick” if i eat too much, so i up-play that side effect out loud to eating too many meals. 

—Sorry this was such a lengthy comment, it’s just something I’ve literally just worked out this week. Good luck, babe

graamatvede,,,,,t2_fw1no,"Hi! Thank you for sharing, I feel your pain. I've purged in the shower as well (sometimes when my ex was controlling if I had purged and was looking for the think layer of fat in the toilet). I was anorexic with purge subtype and turned into bulimic. I lost a tooth due to the acid and my kidneys shut down due to dehidration. 

The beginning in my experience was the hardest. I tried OA, several diets, but what has really helped me was reading (actually listening to) Brain Over Binge - it helped me understand what is going on with my body, why am I acting this way and finally be able to separate myself from that insanity. Then also watching podcasts on Youtube ""What Mia Did next"" and some others. And actually the stepwork from OA as well, since that was working on my inner control freak. As soon as I overcame 3-5 days of binge/purge cycle, it got a lot easier IF I could suck it up and get through the bulimia bloating phase when I thought Id die from pain and looking huge. 

A super huge issue for me was accepting that I am not perfect and throwing up is not a healthy way of keeping fit. The compulsion was 100 times stronger than my voice of reason. So what helped me was talking to people in recovery, listening to recovery videos. And once in a while - just go out to a movie, meet a friend, and remember there is life outside suffering as well.

bell1986,,,,,t2_fv7d8st,"You won't lose with Bulimia. Your weight will fluctuate up and down. I personally have gained but i wanted to have that gain even though my eating disorder doesn't.. I still battle to make sure i hold meals down. Which i do every single day. So my weight is increasing.

People have this idea.. Great i can eat what i want. ANYTHING. Throw up and keep slim. They never speculate the other side.. The crazy depression and anxiety that comes along with it. Being food obsessed everyday. Cancelling social events to binge.. Ignoring friends and family... To binge.  Teeth rotting from the stomach acid's.. Theoat all damaged. Digestion becoming painful and slow. Waking up with banging headaches as your body becomes dehydrated.. Awful brain fog... But above all of this is.. You could drop dead. Yes. Very easily. If you look online it isn't a rare case either. It's common. With us purging we throw up very IMPORTANT Minerals Electrolytes Vitamins needed to actually function. Once our potassium stores become depleted our heart the  struggles to beat and function and eventually it says sorry i have run out of gas... Switches off. That's it.. Your away. I recently started to get muscle cramps very randomly. Legs arms etc.. I had blood work a few week back and my Potassium showed all normal. What they don't tell you ia blood levels are completely different from stored levels. My potassium was struggling. Along with Magnesium and Sodium. So with me even holding foods down daily my body was still struggling to maintain electrolyte balance. I have to salt all my foods. Take extra potassium and also supplement a very good bio available magnesium supplement. I have slowly started to lose the cramps so it just shows that my heart would have also been struggling....

graamatvede,,,,,t2_fw1no,"hi, thanks for sharing. same here. even though i am making no justification for such an overturn, I do see it as a step towards recovery. it was scary as hell to see my weight rise to a healthy number. maybe if i was in patient or in a professional treatment, the transition had been milder. i've been anorexic/bulimic for 7 years, and during the last year when I finally sought treatment, I had 3 periods of not vomitting - 17 days / 2.5 months / 1.5 month. And now 3 days, as I hope it to be over. what helped me the most was the book Brain over Binge, although I've read a ton of books, been to OA, and love watching What Mia Did Next on youtube. Tomorrow ill have the first session with a therapist.

Mishkle,,,,,t2_nflqq,"Why is your mentality straight away to fast? You realize how unhealthy that is too right? You fast, you don’t eat, you feel good, you get hungry, you cave, you puke—OH ILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN. You should stop lying to yourself now about finding other unhealthy ways to “fix” an addiction you have. You’re already doing great with the working out , but you should start telling yourself you’re not actually eating healthy even if you think you are. If you stuff your face with junk and puke it out, but eat a “fruit salad” at 11 to make up for it do you call that healthy?  I don’t think so. 

If I sound harsh, it’s because I mean to be. What stopped my habit was me being real with myself and just honestly saying things for what they are to really turn around, and it’s good to be hard on one Shitty habits. 

Fasting won’t help you look better. 

Starving yourself to “stay skinny” won’t help you. 

Just because you run 5 days a week doesn’t make up for all the shit you put your body through for puking 5-10 times a day.

You could sit him down and have a heart to heart- but I’m not sure how it would go down. 
The best thing would be to be honest with him. If he agrees to stop, you’ll probably have to remind him. But if he does care about you, keep pushing it. Keep reminding him it’s not okay to make those comments.

One thing that really helped me was asking myself if this would matter in five minutes, and normally it wouldn’t.
I also surrounded myself with people. I’m super self conscious so if I’m around people it’s much easier to not binge. Same with staying with said people after eating. 
Also, whenever I felt like purging I would go through this sub. Reading things about decaying teeth (and hearing it from my dentist) is quite literally scaring me straight.
I think the basic thing is...every piece of common advice given for recovery is actually really helpful. The hardest part is starting all the recovery steps. Once you get a rhythm going it gets so much easier.

My digestive system was fucked for years because of laxative abuse and purging, and if I ever engage in those behaviors again, I’m constipated for weeks. 

To discourage you from laxative abuse— there will be a point in time where the entire box of ex lax wouldn’t help you (firsthand experience). So don’t dare go down that slippery road of laxatives, or get that medicine unless you and your Dr have a plan for you to move forward.

1. How often are you eating 

 If you only binge a few times and purge it then you’re less likely to gain lots of weight and more likely to either sustain or lose a bit of weight.

2. What types of foods and how much comes up 

If you’re eating foods you know never comes up then you will definitely gain weight since you’re practically purging little to nothing so most of the calories are absorbed. However the opposite is true too. If you constantly only binge on simple foods then your more likely to sustain or lose weight.

3. How much you naturally burn (RMR/exercise)

If you already exercise and exceed your cal intake by day 50 cals a day, you’re likely to sustain your weight for a while. If you over exercise you will likely sustain or lose weight.

Sorry to read about your problems.  I’ve also struggled with alcohol in the past as well.  Apparently it’s not unusual for bulimics to have substance misuse issues alongside the eating disorder.

There’s no real excuse for it, especially when you’re making it clear to your parents. But sometimes they don’t know what to do, or if what they’re doing is the right thing. Or, they’re in denial that they’re child is struggling through something a lot more severe than they think.

I know recovery may not be the first thing on your mind right now. But please, consider opening up to someone—a friend, a family member, anyone. You don’t deserve to go through this. I’m 16 and I’ve been going through a roller coaster of EDs and disordered habits since I was your age and I wish I stopped while I still could. It only gets worse from here. 

Also consider sitting down with your parents if you can. I understand this may not be an option for you, or something you don’t want to do, but maybe sitting down with them and admitting you have a real issue will help them open their eyes and see. It’s tough, but you can do it.

I work as an RN and yes, excess weight definitely does contribute to health problems, but not enough to justify your mom’s obsession. The patients I see that are bad off got that way through a combination of severe obesity, inactivity, smoking, alcohol, and general noncompliance with medications. And of course aging. 

Definitely not simply being overweight as a teen. 

She should definitely know better than to dismiss the dangers of purging. For example giving yourself a severe electrolyte imbalance or tooth decay.  People can get heart and lung infections from dental problems alone.

It sounds like this is more of a control issue with her, and she’s being abusive. She could have guided you towards a healthy weight in any number of constructive ways, but she chose humiliation and micromanagement

My dad was super critical about my weight. I was the fat one in the family so I made their life difficult the only time my dad talked to me was when I was losing weight. In my family, being fat equals being worthless. So I think for my parents they didn’t want to acknowledge my Ed because then they would have to realized they caused the toxic environment that caused it. 
I didn’t get admitted to IP will 21 and that only because my doctor and therapist got involved. My parents fought the admission  and said I didn’t need it and would figure it out on my own. They still have no idea so it’s just something we don’t talk about. When I was overweight that was when it was the worst because you can get away with a lot. It’s only now I realize how bad it was.

peanutbutterandjoe,,,,,t2_3lucjf6c,"100%. Unfortunately the common rhetoric around eating disorders is that sufferers look like the classic chronic anorexic character we see in movies who is very underweight, but the reality is that most people who suffer for long periods of time look incredibly normal. I think sometimes parents don’t understand that the Ed is still causing major issues in our bodies, including messing with your metabolism and sometimes causing weight gain

I wish I had an answer for you but sometimes I think adults are so stuck in their ways that they don’t see how their comments are actually causing stress and making the Ed worse, perpetuating the cycle. Parents don’t always know how to parent people with eds so I think the best thing you can do is try to control how your moms comments affect you. She may not be able to see it in herself, but if you can recognize what’s getting to you and work on recovery in those times I hope it can help you. 

I also just want to say that if you’re away at school and need to search for help on your own, even without your moms approval, that can be a really positive and independent step you can take towards your own health if you think it’s what’s best for you.

If you’re willing to see a therapist, try asking to see someone who specializes in EDs/food issues.  You can tell her it’s cause you want to eat better and have a healthier relationship with food, cause that is the truth. She’s likely to be supportive because she wants you to lose weight.

The only thing I've found that works for me is putting myself in situations where I simply can't binge and purge. Leaving my wallet at work so I can't go and buy food. Waiting until it's too late at night to binge because I have to get up early. I can't rely on there being other people around because I live alone (and I won't change that because I am someone who *needs* alone time!).

blenki,,,,,t2_4zju4es3,"As someone who struggled with bulimia in the past and then told her (ex)boyfriend about it, I can offer you one and only advice. Trust her. There is nothing worst than doubting your girlfriend, especially when your doubt is based on guessing what any situation may mean. 

I would say the only fair reason to get suspicious is if she spends a lot of time in the bathroom right after you ate or when you notice a bigger amount of food missing in the house. 

Either way, everytime you think that something is not right, just ask her. Make sure you do it nicely without a blame and perhaps express support in case she needs it. But down the line, trust her words. Otherwise you will drive both of you crazy.

Also, the longer you two are togehter the more she will open up. Whether there is still something going on with her or not, I am sure talking about it to you is not necessary easy for her.  Please, also note, just because she is not bulimic by actions anymore, it doesn't mean she is cured in her head. She may still struggle with the things that have triggered her bulima in the first place. So when you feel that something may be off, you may try not to ask about bulimia, but about her feelings, worries etc.

lia_mar1e,,,,,t2_l2hsbne,"something that helped me was identifying the automatic thoughts that i have when i feel the urge to binge and/or purge. this is part of my CBT therapy.

to identify the thought, i first identify the feeling i am feeling in that moment and then i dig much, much deeper and try to identify the thought i'm having.

ex: i feel the urge to binge often in social settings. why? i tend to feel lonely and that i can't connect with anyone there. the automatic thought? that no one likes me and everyone is going to think i'm weird. so, to feel more comfortable, i just keep on eating the snacks that are there so i can feel some sense of familiarity. 

yours are going to be different than mine, but i'm hoping that example can give you some sort of framework. its tough. its not going to be easy. but it has turned my world upside down. once i identified these thoughts, i was able to deal with them head on, rather than using food as a coping mechanism. maybe this isn't what will work for you, but try this method out if you haven't already.

lolimsosorry,,,,,t2_4midhsed,"so this is my advice, and i’m in no way a professional, i’m just telling you what i would have done if i could go back in time and i’m telling you what later worked for me.

I’m 20 now, still relapsing every now and then, and was in your same situation when i was 12. My mom was a lot like yours except she wasn’t super to the point about it, she made those little condescending remarks about my eating habits and weight.

It started off as what you described and it became an obsession for me. I’m worried that the same could happen for you.

If you think you’re becoming bulimic, you probably are, and it’s good that you recognize it at least. I would 

1. try to talk to a school counselor at the very least

2. have a serious conversation with your mom about her comments and how they make you feel. if you have another important adult figure in your life maybe reach out to them for help

high school is a really tough time for a person’s self esteem and body image. in my opinion, (not an expert) it’s important to catch early binging and purging before it develops into bulimia and find out where these habits are coming from. 

for me, i was bulimic for about 4 years consistently and now i occasionally relapse but it’s nothing like i used to be. i found that talking to my friends about it and having a good support system outside of my family genuinely helped. another thing that helps is establishing a healthy way of eating. not a diet, but just eating whatever you want so long as it’s relatively healthy and then treating yourself every now and then. for me it was being vegan (no longer vegan anymore but i do try to eat clean), and getting the courage to go to the gym or even something as small as dancing in my room and taking walks outside every now and then. 

i have a really tough relationship with food and as much as i want to say just eat until you’re full and then stop, i know that’s hard for bingers including myself. but i have learned to somewhat listen to my stomach in that regard. my dad has been a huge help in telling me when i should stop and telling me to find my inner strength and self control.

There's a story about running I love. Mike Cassidy is an amateur runner from Staten Island in New York City. Meb Keflezeighi (Olympic marathoner, silver medalist, all around amazing human being) is one of Mike's heros. In 2012 Mike was running the NYC marathon and having a shit race. The wind was in his face, he was hurting, he wanted to drop out. But he stuck with it. Things start going well and he starts catching up with other runners. Meanwhile, Meb (who's usually in the front of the pack) is having trouble. With three miles to go in the race, Mike *catches up* to Meb (this is INSANE!!). 

Instead of passing him, they finish the race together, hand in hand. 

I took a Dale Carnegie speaking course and shared this story with the class in our last session. What I hadn't realised until that class is that \*everyone\* is struggling with something. We all have a shit race sometimes. We all feel like freaks and literally no one understands us sometimes. Yet we're all in this together. I'd encourage you to reach out to someone so you can feel like freaks together.

MaeveTheLion,,,,,t2_56uhothq,"You probably can't stop for a variety of reasons. It's becoming a habit and there is a strength to habits can keep them going on their own. A therapist once told me that bulimia has a lot in common with obsessive compulsive disorders, and that resonated with me. Even though I'd stopped feeling depressed and enjoy life, bulimia lingered for me (and still lingers). 

For me, the most helpful resources were a therapist I clicked with. She helped me start learning coping skills and provided a model I could mimic. I also loved the book Brain Over Binge and Hip Sobriety. It took about six therapists to find one that was helpful to me, but it was worth the search. 

Every time you choose to binge (and I do believe this is a choice, for myself included) you feed the bulimia gremlin and it gets stronger. Eventually the struggle with food will take over your life. Then the efforts to recover will take over your life. It's gonna suck. The way to take away its power is to stop binging.

Bomby57,,,,,t2_mxdj5w0,"Congrats on the 18 days b/p free!

Don't let it demoralise you, it's totally normal to have at least a binge when you're trying to recover. The best is to develop techniques to avoid binges instead of worry ajout them all the time. You need to get food at the back of your head and not be obsessed with it, or you'll have struggles resisting the binges.

I usually tend to avoid stores and food-related activities when I'm feeling too obsessed with food. Also, try to never let yourself be hungry. Restricting is one of the main factors of relapse in bulimia (also stress, I'll mention this later). Try to listen to your body and develop mindful eating techniques. Overeating isn't always binging. A lot of people overeat, but they still manage to have some control over the act. If you're scared of binging, make the act completely impossible (eat only outside, eat with someone, go for a walk where you can't access food, go take a 20-minute nap, etc). The main purpose is to delay the binge as much as possible. Maybe it's 1 minute when you start this, but maybe you'll be able to avoid the event completely.

Now on stress, yes, food is always a relief. But it won't solve the problem that is making you stressed (given that the problem isn't linked to food...). Try to think rationally. You're having a problem at school or work? What can you do about it? Who can help you? Who can you talk to about this? Focus your mind on solutions to solve the problem instead of numbing your mind with food.

It's a complex process, and I'm still learning too, but it has helped me. I regularly go to the gym at the times I used to go to the store, and stay there until the stores are closed. It's not the perfect way to do it, but it has worked many times, and it's also helped with clearing my mind from stress.

Good luck, you can do it! ❤️",,,1580501709,,,fg4dyhm,False,t3_ewsdg6,,True,t3_ewsdg6,/r/bulimia/comments/ewsdg6/did_good_but_im_scared/fg4dyhm/,,1580501711,1,,True,False,bulimia,t5_2tmc8,,,,,[],,text,,,,False,{},,[],False,0.0,[],,,False,,,,

What you can do is just to listen, make sure she uses harm reduction techniques and that she seeks help when needed. Propose to go with her to get a blood test and check her electrolytes. Make sure she goes to the dentist. Help her seek therapy if she feels ready. Just be an overall support to her without making her feel forced to do this change, it has to come from her.

Maybe do some activities together. Ask her when her most triggering times are (for a lot of bulimics, it's the evening) and try to be with her at that time, go for a walk, do yoga together, watch a TV show together, really ANYTHING to distract her, and take the food away from her mind.

Depending on the severity, you might not be able to help her, and you need to accept that she might not want to get better at that time. That's when you need to make sure she has someone who can monitor that she stays alive and takes whatever supplements she needs...

Joe_MOTS,,,,,t2_gvide,"Hey!  I hope you’re doing relitively okay.  

&amp;#x200B;

I want to let you know that you are strong enough to get out of bulimia.  Obviously, the logical part of you sees the distress its causing you and the havoc its done on your body, but it definitely seems like you have some intrusive thoughts.  Many psychiatric experts actually believe that EDs are closely related to not only anxiety disorders, but also OCD, hence the obsessive-compulsive thoughts that you don’t want but can’t help having.  They are very normal for you to present with them with an ED.  Just because you’re being hit hard right now with obsessive-compulsive thoughts, anxiety, and shame does not mean you aren’t strong.  In fact, the very notion that you’ve been surviving with all of that and depression means quite the opposite.  You can get out of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding your depression, you seem to realize this, but let me reiterate: you don’t deserve to feel the way you do.  You don’t deserve to feel like shit, or hate yourself, or feel like you are worthless.  I promise it is possible to love yourself again, and love your surroundings.  It’s also not abnormal to feel attracted to things that are depressing you further, it is a very strong part of depression for some people.  I know what you’re going through is really tough, but please stick it out and heed my advice.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now, just because you can get out of it does not mean it will be easy, but I promise you it is worth it.  You can regain the want to live again.  It all begins with a support system.  First, and I know easier said than done, tell your boyfriend.  If he really loves you, he wants you to be happy.  He will want to help you and be a part of your support system.  I promise he won’t feel burdened, he wants to get the girl or guy he loves and cares about so much better.  Now that your boyfriend knows, you can have someone to talk to everyday about the ups and downs of your recovery, celebrate your triumphs, and pick you up during your set backs.  

&amp;#x200B;

Next would be seeking help.  I know this sounds scary, it sounds like it will ruin you, but I promise it can only help you.  You’re definitely going to want to see a psychiatrist or a PMHNP (the latter is much cheaper), or at least your physician who can recommend one to you.  It sounds like your parents already know about this, so for you it might be as easy as saying “Hey I want to see a psychiatrist for my eating issues.”  If you don’t believe that will work, then tell them you’ve been feeling anxious lately, or you’ve been having trouble focusing.  Something that uninteresting yet valid to see a psychiatrist.   They can give you advice and coping strategies to conquer bulimia, as well as prescribe medication to give you an extra oomf to your recovery.  Many people have great success with these medications!  They have seen and helped many patients in similar situations to you recover, and their advice can be priceless.  Your psychiatrist will be the “how“ of recovery, as well as show long-term support and tracking, whereas your boyfriend (and peers, should you choose to open up) will give you day-to-day support.  Do not be afraid your psychiatrist will tell your parents about what is going on, if what you say falls under doctor-patient confidentiality, they can not tell your parents.  And, if your parents do know, but can’t understand the severeity of what you’re going through, you can bring your parents to a meeting with your psychiatrist and have him/her explain how strong you’ve been through all of this adversity.   

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you can start feeling better soon!

BougieMoosesBooze,,,,,t2_2so6gn08,"So, for me personally, here are some of the BIGGEST triggers when I’m around other people: 
- The person talks about their dieting and weight loss, especially if there’s numbers involved
- The person brings shitloads of bingeable treats into my house and leaves them there with me unattended (it’s like bringing a bottle of booze to the home of an alcoholic and leaving it there) 
- Having to eat with another person and watching them do things like avoid all bread and carbs, cut every meal in half or eat a ridiculously tiny portion ... you know, like they’re going out of their way to eat the tiniest amount of food and calories possible ... it makes me feel fat even if I ate healthy all day.  It’s not as bad if they just got full or something, but when they’re doing it intentionally to be losing weight, it makes me want to go throw up. 
- The person comments on my food choices. That’s kind of vague, but what I mean by it is that sometimes I will be sticking to whatever meal plan I made for the week and someone will make an offhand comment about the amount of food that I’m eating or that I’m eating corn and **OMG that’s a carb!  You don’t *need* two starches!!!** and for someone who already feels out of control while they’re eating, this is really stressful. 
- Obviously, commenting about your sister’s weight in general. 

On the more positive side, here are some things I find helpful and supportive:
- The person offers to help me with meal planning, prep, or grocery shopping, or do it together with me 
- The person takes the time to listen to me when I’m upset about something going on in my life
- The person offers to help me solve a problem I’m overwhelmed by together
- Comforting me when I’m upset about something 

Again, this is just for me and my own personal experience. But hopefully it’s a helpful starting point.

I'm currently in the exact same place! Struggling with weight gain after I stopped purging. I realise now that I have the opportunity at 23 to heal a coping skill that developed at 13. 

Unfortunately, bulimia involves a series of behaviours starting with the self-criticism and ending with the purge. In recovery, I can now see when I start heading down the bad path. 

Something that's helping is re-forming my relationship with food and exercise! I realise I still have a tendency to over-eat because all my emotions are still tied in with food. Still working on unlearning this HUGE tie-in with my weight gain. 

I'd also recommend forming a support system around you. Sharing my ED story with my sister was life-changing because it's the shame and hiding that's a silent killer. Bringing a therapist into the mix to work on self-image also helps. Or you can do what you're already doing (!), reach out to people online. You're not alone!

Last night I forced myself to eat a sandwich for dinner since I am trying to follow consistently appropriate portions and having something small at each meal. The whole time I was eating all my body wanted to do was throw up the food. I wasn’t even trying. It just felt repulsive trying to eat. 

It’s 6 hours later and I am still thinking about how awful it felt to eat when I rather just restrict.

It feels like the biggest issue for me right now is that my body never lines up with when I “should” eat. I either go long periods avoiding food or I have non stop eating until I make myself sick.

laylag93,1516323530.0,,,,t2_smxrum1,"Tomorrow is a new day and a new beginning. You have to understand that the reason why you keep repeating these actions is only because of a cycle. You binge, then you feel guilty and after you want to get rid of it and when you do or don’t, you feel bad again and it never stops. After, it all comes with judging ourselves in negative ways. Saying we’re ugly, worthless and fat. When we are special and we ARE worth it! We all deal with things in life, and I’m sorry your parents are not available right now.. I hope your mom finds the strength to combat alcoholism. What my psychologists tells me most of the time is that you can always go back on track. Just keep going with it and when supper time comes along, even if you’re not hungry, just have a snack or something. Just to say you’re not in a restrictive mode. 
My nutritionist suggests and almost obliges to eat in a mechanical way. Which means, breakfast ( all the food group included), snack ( two of the food groups included) lunch, snack and diner. This helps you feel in control during the day and you don’t have time to get in a starving hungry mode ( which if you do, you’re more susceptible to binge eating). And you’re ALLOWED to a second serving if you feel like it. Example: another piece of chocolate, cake, popcorn bol, piece of fish etc. 
Also, there are emotions behind all your actions. The fact that you binge, it shows that it’s a way of drowning your pain, or your anxiety/stress. It shows that you’re going through something and instead of facing it or trying to pinpoint what you’re feeling or going through, you help yourself with food instead. And while you do it, it feels like a relief doesn’t it? And then it just goes to shit, telling yourself ohhh tomorrow will be different blabla. You should be proud that you wrote something, it’s a great step to putting some weight off your shoulders. You should also keep yourself a journal just to empty everything in there!

And the last thing, you seem to be in a fragile state and weak. Before things lead to bulimia, you can maybe seek help with a therapist that is specialized in eating disorders. I’ve been following one almost every week for the past 2 years, and I’ve been much better compared to a few years ago. Even though things are going great, it’s just a reminder to stay on track when I see her once in a while.
Your story reminds me of me when I started high school and I used to eat so much in one sitting. Then I felt so bad I decided to purge. I so regret that day, I wish I never did.

What does it matter how pretty you are if your personality is a vacuum? I've had friends who sucked the life out of the room whether via insecurity, self-deprecation or negativity. It's not only unattractive, it's repellent. But that's not what matters. Most importantly, *you* will have to live with whichever version of yourself you choose to reinforce. So please don't value the opinions of unstable, self-involved pubescents on tumblr. They are *so* irrelevant, I don't know how to make it clearer. You seem like you have a lil bit of emotional maturing to do and I wish you the best of luck. I'm the same age as you, diagnosed bipolar 2, having fluctuated +\- 40 pounds every year since starting college as a result of BED. Not to mention the sudden onset of BD. Not to mention my psychiatrist thinks I'm BPD! Hahah. So I humbly understand and acknowledge your suffering. But I have found that humor changes my entire perspective. It has made my shoulders feel lighter, like the weight of the world doesnt balance on them or anyone's opinions of 'em. People aren't porcelain dolls, which are picture-perfect but no fun at all, because they're so breakable. I'd rather be a funny, confident, cool girl who is attractive because of those qualities. Being pretty is easy. It's not rare or impressive. While I'm sure you are gorgeous(!!), it will be so much more worthwhile to carve out your unique psyche-- metacognitive habits, self-assurance, humble confidence, creative expression. Therapy might also be beneficial. And I suggest deleting visual social media apps off your phone, especially instagram + Tumblr. 🙅🏻  Or at least move them to the last page on your home screen (I've done this, and I encourage my friends to do so). As an alternative, definitely listen to something! I suggest podcasts like *Tara Brach* (A++ meditations), *99% Invisible*, *Hidden Brain* (interesting &amp; easily-digestible psychology/sociology), *The One You Feed* (mental health) etc. if you want some more in-depth pod suggs, lmk!

9 months ago
For me it was very back and forth for a few years, knowing that I need help versus not wanting it, not being able to take it. People push you so hard to get help, that you almost dont want to get it to spite them. I was in and out of therapy with different people ones my parents noticed something was up, not motivated to help myself. Useless. After 4 years I started seeing a therapist from America that i got good contact with (we still speak to this day), and we worked the next two years on changing my mentality around food and body image, working on past traumas and what not. Ater that i started cutting back on binging/purging. Took another year or so before I was going several weeks at a time without doing it. 
Sorrounding yourself with people who will support your healthy choices and shoot down your unhealthy choices is one of the most important things. Someone has to be even stricter than ED, and if you cant do it, it has to be someone else. But someone you trust to know whats right for you. Even though its a personal battle, you cant do it alone. You need to see your mom cry her eyes out because she feels so helpless looking at you, or your (true) friends telling you how much it pains them to see you suffer. The moment you actually understood that what you're doing is not only ruining your own life and health, now and in the future, it's also hurting everyone you care about (or the ones who care about you at least) as well.

Rinse your mouth with warm water and baking soda after an episode. This won't fix much, but it will kind of soothe the top of your esophagus and reduce the acidity in your mouth.

Ask a gastroenterologist about getting on either or both the following medications: Ranitidine (brand name: Zantac), and a proton pump inhibitor like Prilosec (generic name: Omeprazole), Nexium, Prevecid or Protonix. 

Your doses will vary depending on how long you've been purging.

**Also:** try to have one or two phone numbers handy of good friends you can talk to when you're about to go on a binge. That's not always easy for bulimics because many of us isolate ourselves socially. I won't promote any 12 step groups here because I find them ineffective.

not_quite_majestic,1404064957.0,,,,t2_h6onm,"This sounds a lot like my own progression into full-fledged bulimia. Just started out purging a few times a year when I ate to the point of sickness. And then a little more frequently when I felt like I had strayed from my diet. And then I started actually buying food that I could binge/purge. Now it happens almost every day, sometimes multiple times a day. I'm ashamed, I hate wasting the food, I'm worried about my teeth, I hate how much time it takes out of my day - but I don't stop. I'm not even sure I want to stop. I mean, I DO, but at the same time I'm looking forward to binging later tonight. Good god, brain. STOP! 

I tell you this so you know you aren't alone. I do enjoy talking to my therapist, who specializes in eating disorders. It's a relief to be able to talk about it, though my bulimia hasn't gotten any better. Perhaps it would work better for you? It would probably help to tell at least one person that you trust. Right now I'm trying to find strategies to distract myself when I want to binge. My therapist suggested making a list of things I have to complete before I can binge like calling a friend, taking a shower, cleaning a room, singing one song, just to give myself the option of changing my mind. She also said one thing that has worked for people is to make a time in the day that you binge/purge, even if you don't feel like it. Make it into a chore so it no longer has control over you. Beyond stuff like that, I think it's important to know WHY you feel this compulsion. Obviously, that's a hard question to answer, but you can try to think through what in your past has influenced your body image and eating patterns and what is happening now to make you feel depressed or anxious or guilty or critical of yourself. Journalling has been helpful for me as well as (I know this is stupid) talking aloud to my cat.

What I wanted to say is that I remember the wise conclusion I have reached at some point (before going bulimic) which is that the food compulsions may indeed never go away. There's a few things in life like that (bereavement, some types of love) and I think the best way, maybe the only way, is to acknowledge that, accept it and come up with coping strategies as opposed to fighting plans.

Hearmeoutyo,1518321620.0,,,,t2_wgo438p,"Alright, time to give you the hard truth.  Man, being young must suck, but the good thing is are you willing to learn.  

I want to go and say Bulimia is an addiction.  That means anyone who has trauma and never chose to seek therapy and resolve their problems will develop an addiction.  May it be drugs, sex, shopping, food and etc.  The fact the person is using something/someone to fulfill their happiness, you are dealing with someone with an addiction. My main question is your girlfriend does she hate what she sees in the mirror?  Does she need you to make her happy?  If the answer is yes, she needs to go find help.  Google eating disorder and helplines, and find help.  Eating disorder do not go away by themselves especially if the person with the addiction doesn’t even know who they are.  I mean come on, are you supposed to know who you are right now?

Now if you do have an eating disorder, I implore you to look at the recovery.  The only way to get over Bulimia is to fully binge by mindful eating, meaning to eat as slow as possible so your brain can register when it is full or not.  You will have crazy thoughts but by binging will you understand and fully begin to listen to your body.  Every time, you try and control or restrict, your body will fight back and hence you binge forcing a “perfectionism” vicious cycle.  Just to let you know, you will gain weight, but your body will go back to it’s original set weight.  Whatever you told me about your girlfriend’s height, throw those numbers away.  BMI is out of date and it means nothing.  A girl can be healthy at the 170cm 50kgs and still be healthy at 90kgs.  Curing and eating disorder is a combination of the physical (knowing the peron’s body type and set weight designed by their genetics), mental (is the person probes to mental illness i.e- bipolar, borderline personality, schizophrenia and etc) and emotional (prior history of trauma- was there abuse, rape or being sheltered) Humans are like dog breeds, if your girlfriend was meant to be a French bull dog and research what French bulldogs are like.  If you’re supposed to be a border collie, research what a border collie is like. One thing you can never do though is force a French bulldog to be a border collie.  If your girlfriend wasn’t meant to be a model then accept your girlfriend is not a model.  Most importantly, she has to realize this herself.  But once the trauma is accepted will your girlfriend fully recovers. Of course via healthy eating and plain old fashion exercise.  

Encourage your girlfriend to people watch, see what people do.  Eating disorder being and addiction is also a social disorder too.  The only way to get out of her behaviour is to be around people to create new behaviour. The best example I will give you is Ihave a friend who was a fashion model, her eating disorder did not stem from modelling, it stemmed from growing up in a poor abusive family and being raped.  This friend know never knew how to be social but she forced herself to learn and accept her past was tough but it help make her strong.  To this day, she is now a Hollywood film director.  

I hope this information helps.  Should let you know if your girlfriend chooses to not get help she will be known as useless in this society.  No one likes excuses and no one has time for them.  Also, down the road if you do end up breaking up, I would not be surprised.  Either way eventhough your girlfriend may have a problems, but you should look at yourself to see do you need to please/help someone to make yourself feel happy?  For every addict, there’s always an enabler.  

Good luck OP, you will be offended by this post but when you go to bed, you know it’s true because for a person who is truly secure and healthy, why would a stable person chose a partner who’s an addict?   Not only should you ask your girlfriend these hard questions, but you should also ask yourself these hard questions too.",True,0.0,1520248444,,0.0,dv7hicu,False,t3_7l0fit,,True,t1_driz9ay,/r/bulimia/comments/7l0fit/my_girlfriend_isnt_sure_if_she_has_bulimia_or_not/dv7hicu/,,1524831283,1,,True,False,bulimia,t5_2tmc8,public,,1520248981.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tighter its grip, the more shameful I feel, constantly stuck in the fast paced, adrenaline pumping rush of food in and out and in and out in a frenzied out of control buzz. I feel great because I got the food out but horrible because I got the food out. But also horrible I put the food in, even though the act of putting it in felt good. By the end of it, the bulimia is the only thing that feels good. Its the only thing that makes me feel at all. Its a battle within myself that makes me an emotional mess, snapping at everyone and pushing everyone away even though I don't actually want to do that. 

The best thing is to offer support, and suggest treatment. There are a lot of treatment options, inpatient, outpatient, support groups, etc. There are also medicines that help with the anxieties and depression, and therapies that can help teach her ways to handle situations that cause the binging. There is always help available, (talking to her doctor, or family member, or a mental health specialist, whatever and whoever she has access to. Shes not alone and people will assist her in getting help) and getting better is very much possible. She just needs to realize she can live without/overcome the bulimia.

Also... there are many avenues of help out there besides therapy and medication, if therapy is just not a good match for you.  I was bulimic for 12 years and the main way that I found recovery was neither therapy nor medication.

Thank you for having the courage to post something so honest. I am legitimately on the same wave as you re: recovery, relationship, food obsession. 

What has been helping me lately is getting back into cooking, and falling in love with food again. It’s REEEEALLLLLY hard, but I tried to sit with myself and think “okay, what flavours do you like? What protein? What meals?” And cooking them my way gives me a little bit of that control-aspect that binge-purge does. 

I also try to eat intuitively - there’s SUCH a rush in spooning Nutella into my face like it’s my job (literally I shake with anxiety and relief when I binge and do this knowing “Ha sucker jokes on you I’m gunna throw it all up!”) ... but it doesn’t make me feel good. And then after a purge? I’m starving! I’m trying to listen to my body and feed it WHOLE and HEALTHY and calorie DENSE foods for sustenance (nuts, full fat yogurt and cheeses) 

Also, consider the actual act of eating, what do you like? Crunchy? Soft and moist foods? Liquids like soups and shakes? The physical action of eating as an experience itself can be GOOD (not rushed or scary or destructive) 

All in all, this is what I personally try to do - and I fail most days, but I still try. And I wish you so much strength and love and support in your journey

Josephinejager,1523266650.0,,,,t2_15zo4x1t,"My heart truly goes out to you. I’m currently in a relapse and it’s such a battle. However, I have had long stretches  (1-2) years of joyful remission. During those times body hatred was low, eating felt safe, I had a lot of energy, and it was like veil was gradually lifted and I began engaging in the freedom and the life that was previously robbed 
Sadly, each time, after 1-2 years stress or something minor would cause a purge and it was off to the races again. 

All experts say it takes a while for the body to adjust from the effects of bulimia or other disorders. Often the digestive system and brain pathways (sensations of fullness/hunger) are WAY out of whack. Sitting with an uncomfortable feeling and not purging is like hell on earth for me. Battling through a binge urge is just as bad. They’re two sides of the same coin. 
Every time you choose not to purge, you are also  choosing not to binge, your body is given a chance to normalize, and it eventually gets way more comfortable. Intuitive eating, natural hunger kick in.

When it seems daunting remind yourself of HOW much work you are doing. Living with bulimia is a nightmare. Every day you aren’t engaged in it is a major victory. Bulimia is like a friend with empty promises. It’s an easy momentary out but it’s a long-term train wreck. I’ve never found it to significantly contribute to weight loss.

I think a great first step would be to seek a therapist to help you get to the root of the behavior and develop a treatment plan for you.

I took her advice bc I’m fed up with Day 1s ... I’ve got six days in the past two weeks🙄. Seems like nothing but when you’re down the rabbit hole it’s something.

I’m glad you have support to keep fighting. The years of remission I look back on as the happiest times of my life. Each time after the first few months,  I was enjoying preparing and consuming food, felt very present and tuned in to my body, had sooo much energy. After a year I would barely remember what it felt like to be bulimic. I just didn’t think about it anymore. Then something would inevitably trip it up ... usually caused by too much stress, being tired, not being present. One minor sneaky purge and before you know it full-blown relapse. 

Never been prescribed anything for bulimia except an antidepressant years ago. I hope you find success with it.

Debonaire_Death,1291589754.0,,,,t2_4l6lc,"&gt; I am too old to be sitting in a circle with a bunch of 17 year olds talking about how ""there are no bad foods"" and ""weight is just a number.""

You certainly are, but that's partly because these codas are an over-simplification of life. Obviously there are bad foods (and yes, I binged on donuts sometimes back in the day--they are the WORST, not the least because they taste AMAZING).

My last binge/purge cycle was while I was working at Whole Foods (and yes, I was one of those uppity gourmet bulimics--when I wasn't binging on pizza and donuts, at least--so a gourmet food store was the *worst* environment for me as a recovering bulimic). I loved my job, but it was one steady stream of temptations working there, and it could be unbearable by the time I got home.

I would binge late at night to hide it from everybody, and wake up exhausted. It was causing problems with my job performance.

The way I finally broke the cycle was, oddly enough, another addictive substance--amphetamines.

But not like you might think! No, I wasn't chewing up diet pills and saying ""I'm cured now that I can keep the weight off no matter what!"" No, I tried a very careful regimen that has actually gained some traction as a successful treatment among professionals.

It's a low-dose amphetamine regimen--my dose was 5mg Vyvanse (which is equivalent to around 2.5 or 3 mg Adderall) once a day in the mornings.

You see, there are many neurochemical aspects to bulimia--that's why it's so overpowering. Your body releases tons of opioids--particularly endorphins--when you vomit. This produces the sense of calm and exhaustion that comes after a purge (or, if you've been doing it a lot, only after multiple binges and purges). It's like popping an oxycontin every time you throw up, and stopping the cycle is partly hard because you are going through opioid withdrawal.

Amphetamines [potentiate the painkilling effects of opioids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304395988902977), giving you more of a cushion while coming out of the bulimic haze of endorphins.

Another major factor in bulimia are two peptides your body makes to control feeding behavior [neuropeptide Y and peptide YY](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/495044). Amphetamines [lower neuropeptide Y levels](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006899387907025), reducing the binge behavior.

The important part is keeping the dose low so that you don't lose your appetite entirely, but instead are able to simply better control your feeding behavior while your body adjusts to a healthier diet.

I only used the amphetamines for 2 weeks before getting off of them, and I had no withdrawals or other side effects. I had to quit my job at Whole Foods, as well, because I might as well have been an alcoholic working as a bartender.

Also, I know this sounds crazy, but it's important to be honest with people about your bulimia, especially once you're in recovery.  The last thing the good side of you wants is for people to unknowingly supply you with binge food, like the donuts at the office. I think you'd be surprised how much people will care if you are open with them, and it gives you an added level of accountability. I'm pretty open with most people who know me that I'm a recovering bulimic. It's far harder to do this when you're trapped in a binge/purge cycle, but it's an important step and it gets easier the further you get in time from your last binge.",True,0.0,1528055389,,0.0,e01zw2w,False,t3_8o641g,1.0,True,t3_8o641g,/r/bulimia/comments/8o641g/relapsing_hardcore_these_last_several_months/e01zw2w/,56620.0,1532156382,2,False,True,False,bulimia,t5_2tmc8,public,,,,[],,text,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,markdown,

Debonaire_Death,1291589754.0,,,,t2_4l6lc,"One of the most insidious things about bulimia is how it builds on itself--similar to how drinking alcohol impairs your judgment and makes you okay with more alcohol, binging and purging has an enabling quality. There have been times in my life where I *wanted* to ""slip up"", or like you I rationalized my next binge and purge on having ""already screwed things up"" with the previous one. At some point, it may not even seem obvious that stopping matters anymore, especially when you're going through the kind of wild fluctuations of hormones and neurotransmitters that can make the world of bulimia seem surreal and dream-like, driven by inarticulate urges.

It's for this reason that I cannot recommend enough two things:

* *Don't ignore the worst parts of your disease--remember them.* I mean remembering how disgusting the vomit in the toilet looks, how much you just spent on all of this stupid binge food, the worst parts of how it feels, the dirtiness and the acidity of the vomit. *Your life depends on being able to convince yourself not to fall back into the behaviors that create these horrible effects, and remembering them well and properly is the only way to fight this: fight it with the bad memories that bulimia has given you.* There have been times where I was tempted to binge, even though I've been clean for about a year, and I have to pointedly *attack* these thoughts--almost like screaming in my own head. I have several particular tableaus from my own experience stored in vivid detail in my memory from the worst moments of binging and purging, and when I find myself nursing these self-destructive thought patterns, I'll take as much time as is needed reviewing these terrible memories in my head until I no longer want to make new ones. Sometimes it's too easy to remember the good parts of binging--all the naughty foods and the kind of euphoric delirium that comes from the binge. That must be stopped to truly stop this disease.
* *Be articulate with yourself about what you are doing*. As I said above, for me this might mean screaming, in my head or out loud, ""YOU'RE CHASING STUPID, SHALLOW PLEASURES THAT WILL DESTROY YOUR LIFE!"" Sometimes it comes down to recognizing what is stressing you out, and admonishing yourself that *binging will not help you solve any of these problems*. Even if the problem is keeping off weight, remember how many other horrible issues follow a binge/purge cycle, including the destruction of the same self-esteem that you were trying to build up by keeping off the pounds. Talk it out with yourself. Have a very serious conversation and keep the incontrovertible evidence that bulimia is horrible at the front of the conversation. Fight with yourself if you have to, until you win.

Don't give up! And also, *express yourself!* Recognize your pain and articulate it. Will it hurt? *As much as it needs to*. If you've been truly mistreating yourself, then you need to hurt--mistreatment should cause pain, and that pain is the catalyst to change.

Also, there are some interesting pharmacological treatments for this. Low-dose amphetamines are a very interesting emergent therapy. I actually tried this on my own before it was becoming popular--5mg of Vyvanse, every morning, for 2 weeks following the last major binge/purge cycle I ever had. I had a good job and lots to look forward to in life but I still couldn't deal, and the increased appetite control and subtle anxiolysis of low-dose amphetamine gave me the push I needed to get out of that feedback loop.

Everyone who goes far enough with bulimia eventually has that fear: the fear that it won't end until your dead. I had it. I'm better, and I'll go months without a serious thought of binging at all, and when those thoughts do come (and they can come months, years after you've stopped), *be ready.*",True,0.0,1527984950,,0.0,e00ntsn,False,t3_8nzuso,1.0,True,t3_8nzuso,/r/bulimia/comments/8nzuso/i_want_to_stop/e00ntsn/,47427.0,1532133239,3,False,True,False,bulimia,t5_2tmc8,public,,,,[],,text,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,markdown,

Hi Josephine,

I had lost count of the number of times I promised myself to never binge again, only to fail a few days, or even hours, later. 

I was out of control.
Nothing could stop me from bingeing.
I even binged, then purged, on a plane, in the middle of a flight, one time.

I can also remember finding a small bag of mixed sweets that somebody had left on a seat when I was working at my local cinema.
I couldn’t resist the urge.
I grabbed the bag and devoured the sweets right then and there. 

I can hardly believe that now.
Even somebody’s leftovers were way too tempting to pass up.

It is truly amazing to think about the lengths that the urges can force us to go to.
I was beginning to seriously question my own sanity. 

Despite confronting the strength of those urges day in and day out, I still couldn’t confront the reality of my life. 

I wanted to bury my head in the sand and pretend that it didn’t exist. 

I continued on delaying recovery.
After all, there is always tomorrow, right?

After all, I’d have a much better chance at success if I just waited for the right time.
I would recover, of course I would - but only when the circumstances for my recovery were absolutely perfect. 

It is so easy to play the ‘when’ game.

    •    When I have more time…
    •    When I am less stressed…
    •    When I feel ready…
    •    When my kids are older and more independent…
    •    When the new week starts...
 
The truth is that the perfect time never comes.
The stars never align in quite the right way. 

However, I've also learnt that the monster isn’t as scary as it might seem.
It’s just that we keep on wasting our energies on delaying the task, rather than getting it over and done with.
 
There are five surprisingly powerful words that I want you to say to yourself:

 if not now, then when?

This doesn't apply exclusively to your health.
This isn’t JUST about your eating disorder.
It applies to everything that you've been putting off.

What do you want to do? And why aren’t you doing it yet?

If not now, then when?

If I was able to do it, then you will be able to get there too. I promise.

Your friend and coach,

ezranilla,1477946437.0,,,,t2_12i8dr,"It will be okay! I promise!! They are the teeth experts and their job is to help you have better teeth, not to make you feel shitty about the teeth you have. 

I just went to the dentist last week for the first time in two years. It was my first adult dentist appointment, and it didn’t happen until now because it got lost in the sauce since I went to college. I have some cavities, and a couple of them are on the outsides of my teeth. There’s no 100% sure way to know if they’re specifically from bulimia, but I wasn’t super surprised to hear that. I was planning on telling them either way, but when they said that it seemed like an appropriate time to say that. She was super cool about it and I told her it’s something I’m actively working on and in treatment for and she said everyone has their vices and I felt zero judgement. I’m sure it’s not super uncommon for dentists to have patients with bulimia because it is a disease that affects your teeth. 

None of this changes the fact that I have cavities and that dealing with them is not going to be fun, but I’m really glad I went now and didn’t wait any longer before anything got worse. You are going the right thing by going now!! They can clean your teeth and scrape out all the plaque because they have the tools to do that, and after that your teeth will be in way better shape. It’s way better to know what’s going on in your mouth than dread finding out. And it may not be as bad as you think!

Don’t stress too much about trying to not b/p before your appointment. One week isn’t going to make some crazy difference. It’s is an excellent goal, but don’t be too hard on yourself. And we are always here to support you. 

TL;DR: don’t stress too much because it’s going to be okay. The dentists are here to help! But I would definitely tell them about your bulimia.

I was pretty much pulling teeth for a “clean” day this month and could not get there. I finally have seven days in a row b/p free. YAY!

My humble suggestion, which I heard from a recovery professional:

- Write down a list of all the little things you are doing RIGHT (detox tea, prolonging an urge by 30 min., getting through almost a whole day, self-care, mindful eating, positive thoughts, whatever.)

This professional said “getting excited about victories cements learning.” So if you encourage yourself &amp; focus on what you are doing right, no matter how small, it stimulates your mind towards recovery.

Conversely, beating oneself up over the “failures” has the opposite effect of making us more likely to continue bingeing/purging.

Probably kinda obvious but just wanted to mention it bc the some the hardest work is done right before you start to get a lot of clean days.

&amp; please continue to post on progress? Hearing other stories, of ups &amp; downs, always helps me.

Self-induced vomiting causes binge behavior to increase. The more you purge, the more likely you will crave large amounts of high-calorie foods in the future. And thus it becomes a cycle. Which can lead to hair loss, extreme fatigue, heart problems, dental decay and even death.

A mentor who recovered after 20 years of bulimia  taught me that you are not your thoughts; you are the observer of your thoughts. And you have the power to change them.

Good job on identifying your thoughts &amp; seeking info to combat them.

I’ve also been working on identifying, observing &amp; dismissing my own disordered thoughts as a way to stop purging.

Good on you for coming out to your parents about it. Here are some good steps towards a healthier overall life that might keep you away from the binge/purge cycle:

* *Cut out any foods that make you feel guilty or stupid*. You probably didn't need to be eating those, anyway. For me, this was soda, candies (outside of dark chocolate), deep-fried foods, and processed sugars and grains. Don't think of it as a diet, so much as a basic part of coming to terms with adulthood in a wacky world of sci-fi mass-produced junk foods at your fingertips. Eventually you won't even want them, and even learn to enjoy not wanting them.
* *Don't sugarcoat the nastiest memories of this disease.* Those are a weapon against future binges. I actually had a temptation to binge on pizza the other day for the first time in many months, and I had to sit in silence for a good 15 minutes brooding over the horrific conditions I endured in the grip of addiction, until I remembered how much I never want to be there again. It's very easy, especially when you are hungry, to only remember the good times of bulimia. This is a fatal mistake.
* *Start a meal schedule and stick to it*. This shouldn't have to be anything more than eating within the same 1-hour windows every day, but it goes a huge way to stabilizing your nervous system to avoid any highs or lows when you might be particularly susceptible to temptation.
* *Consider low-dose amphetamines if things seem truly hopeless.* This might sound crazy but it's an emergent psychiatric method to give ED sufferers a low-dose prescription of an amphetamine for around 2 or 3 weeks to help them get their feeding cycle under control. There are actually neurochemical bases for this. I used 5mg Vyvanse in the morning daily for 2 weeks to get out of my very last full-blown binge-purge cycle, and I haven't needed it since. Do everything you can to manage on your own, but don't be ashamed if you need a bit of chemical help, either. I have ADHD so I had access to Vyvanse anyway (I haven't used it in many months besides to stop my bulimia--amphetamines are just too addictive for habitual use), so I'm not sure how easily you'll get access to these if you asked a physician.

Remember that you are dealing with one of the most difficult of all addictions and don't feel any less of yourself for it. People struggle with whatever vortex they're most likely to get sucked into; you just got unlucky with your hand of cards and fate. Don't waste too much time feeling sorry for yourself, either. Everyone has problems, and it's within your power to deal with yours.

graamatvede,1396011760.0,,,,t2_fw1no,"Hi!

I'm very sorry to hear it. You are not alone. I had some struggles in relationship as well. My bf helped me through alcoholism (30 days sober today), but he has it very hard because of my eating disorder since he has no understanding on it and it scares him. We also lived together and now deiced to live apart but keep the relationship with the condition I am working on myself - and I mean it. I've been purge free for 4 days now. 

As much as it is sad (and as much as I would like him to give me the selfless love and say you would do the same for him) - you are your own parent and only you can help yourself. I can see how much it hurts my man to see me hurt myself (that is what I am doing when I purge) and no person should be co-addicted or ignore to this illness. 

Love yourself, you will be the best care taker of yourself. You deserve your best possible version of you. And so does your boyfriend. As sad as it is you cannot blame him for willing to be with a healthy person who loves themselves. I also dreamed of my man to accept my illness, but that's a very selfish thing to ask from the other person.

Making sure she knows you are there and willing to provide what she needs and be with her throughout the process is the most you can do. Let her know that when it comes time for her to make that step, you will be right there supporting her. 

Also, in reply to your last question, it doesn't always require a disaster. Sometimes it comes down to just genuinely being tired of living with the disorder.

My fiancé left me when after years I was unable to make any progress in recovery. It was hard.

This is my advice to you after living through this. Though it might not feel like it, one day you will meet someone who will love you for just who you are. Eating disorder included.
When my fiancé left me I thought I would never be able to find someone. We had been best friends since kindie. We had been together for five years. Lived together that entire time. He was so understanding and supportive, and he ‘got’ it because his sister had bulimia too... I thought, if he couldn’t love me, no one could.
But I was wrong. I met someone else and.. I can not describe to you how wonderful this man is. Do not get me wrong, he has MANY faults. But. He honestly and truly loves me - for me. And no matter what I am going through, he is able to love me. For me. These past two years I’ve been in and out of hospital to treat my ED. I’ve had too many health scares to count. Suicide attempts as well. But you know what? Even when I was in a psychiatric ward begging him to let me leave so I could kill myself - even when we rode in the back of the ambulance hoping I made it in time to save me from the damage I had done to my body - even when I was a shell of my former self... he still saw ME. He still saw qsims when he looked at my face.

That is what you deserve.

I know you’re going through a hard time right now, but it will pass. You will be ok.

And you deserve to be loved for you. No matter what. I’m sorry your ex couldn’t be that for you. But you deserve better and one day that will come ❤️

I do ok with waiting longer between meals and being ok with hunger- opposed to craving it or trying to avoid emptiness. For keto you can keep the basics there- lean protein, high amounts of veggies, low sugar fruits and nuts, and health-ish fats. You will not be in ketosis per say, but you'll get the benefits of greatly reduced insulin spikes and near empty gylcogen storage.

bookemdanno050,1354292732.0,,,,t2_9r9qz,"First, congratulations! I hope that you're excited for the big day itself. Preparing for a wedding is a very stressful time without an eating disorder, and when you have one it can be exceptionally rough. (Even everything is really well.) Please remember that relapses happen for a lot of reasons, but they are not permanent. They're incredibly difficult at the best of times. Your weight is not up for your in-laws' speculation- is there a polite way to explain that to your MIL in very few words?
 
What you've said about your partner's lack of understanding is concerning. Bulimia isn't a ""diet program,"" and losing weight isn't the real answer to most of the problems that it stems from, if any. Do you currently see a therapist by yourself? He may not understand how important it is for you to have him understand what mental illness is, especially this one.

Debonaire_Death,1291589754.0,,,,t2_4l6lc,"There's actually an interesting neurochemical aspect to social contact and bulimia. I'll try not to get too fancy, but it's really interesting and can teach you something about why you respond to situations like this.

Bulimia is heavily tied up with opioids in your brain, like endorphins (which make you feel good while you work out and kill pain). Every time you vomit, your brain releases a bunch of endorphins so that you feel better than you did before you threw up. This is in part why throwing up when your sick makes you feel better.

Opioids are also released when you eat delicious food, and are a major part of what makes food enjoyable.

Unfortunately, with bulimia this feel-good signal becomes overused, and your opioid system adapts so that you only feel normal when you're binging and purging on a regular cycle that can keep your opioid high going. Withdrawal from this cycle will cause opioid withdrawal, and like a heroin addict, you become fixated on nothing but getting your next hit. It becomes an obsessive cycle.

So this is where it get's interesting: *human contact causes opioid release*. You get endorphins from compassionate touch and emotional connection. Even more than this, powerful connections with other people cause oxytocin release, too, which sensitizes you to opioids, causing a feel-good feedback loop.

This is why bulimia causes people to socially isolate: one of the major motivations for socializing is opioids, and when you start getting that opioid high from another source--one that runs counter to the fulfillment of social needs--you end up isolating because you have literally subsumed your natural systems for obtaining good feelings and satisfaction with life.

The deep feelings you have for your friend have likely caused just such a loop: you are releasing oxytocin when you are around him and when you think about him, and this is resensitizing you to endorphins so that you don't feel the craving to binge and purge.

This is why I always tell people that one of the most important steps to recovery from bulimia (and most other addictions) is to open up to those who care about you and let them into your intimate life. Bulimia is a gross, wasteful thing, but simply hating yourself for it doesn't do any good, and making connections with people you care about stronger is the best way to climb out of that hole.

Take this opportunity to strengthen your other social bonds, and invest yourself in things that wont leave you any time for binging and purging. While I'm glad you've found someone, life is long and things change, and that relationship may not come to fruition. Prepare yourself for the long haul, and use this time you've been given to figure out where you went wrong, what not to do again, and how to love yourself.",True,0.0,1531426575,,0.0,e29yl14,False,t3_8yamf5,1.0,False,t3_8yamf5,/r/bulimia/comments/8yamf5/its_amazing_how_someone_can_aid_your_recovery/e29yl14/,18152.0,1535994200,5,False,True,False,bulimia,t5_2tmc8,public,,,,[],,text,False,,r/bulimia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

toyouisay,1490384666.0,,,,t2_16gsop,"Hey, so a couple things. There’s an eating disorder called ednos/osfed (eating disorder not otherwise specified or otherwise specified feeding or eating disorder) that covers people with a lot of disordered eating who don’t fall into the bulimia or anorexia categories. I’m diagnosed with EDNOS (my symptoms are fairly different from you but it’s a very broad diagnosis because EDs are super variable), so don’t worry if you miss like one specific diagnostic criteria.

[Here’s an official description of bulimia and it’s diagnostic criteria](https://www.eatingdisorder.org/eating-disorder-information/bulimia-nervosa/). You’ll notice “Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors (such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, fasting, or excessive exercise) in order to prevent weight gain” is listed instead of just the self induced vomiting.


I’m glad you decided to post here. I’m not a doctor, so I have no way of diagnosing you, but I will say a lot of your description of your disordered eating sounds very familiar. Body dysmorphic disorder (where you can’t see the weight you’ve lost or can’t tell what size you are) is **very** common among eating disorders. I think you should consider making that appointment.

Based on your fear of gaining weight and heavy food restriction, I would suggest talking to someone or at the very least looking into anorexia some more. It’s extremely dangerous, and is actually the mental illness with the highest mortality rate if I remember correctly. Eating disorders are a horrible beast, and if you can start getting help before you’re at a dangerous weight or in the hospital for malnutrition, that’s a blessing.

The endoscopy is not nice but you don’t have to state you have bulimia if you aren’t ready to. They’ll just check for any ulcers that may be causing the indigestion.

The enzymes help your body digest food as soon as you eat it, so it works in your stomach to reduce bloating, pain, and food sensitivities. I recommend Enzymedica brand, it’s high quality and broad spectrum. 

Probiotics work in the small intestine to help break down food and nutrients still left in the GI tract. The GI tract is also responsible for most of your immune system so a probiotic is a great idea all around. I recommend Renee Life, Solaray, or Megafood brands and at least 30 billion. They’re all on amazon for pretty cheap, or if you have a health food store near you, like Whole Foods, they might carry them. 

I’ve been there and I take digestive enzymes with every meal bc I fucked up my stomach so much. The best thing for you to know is that this is not permanent. The human body is incredibly resilient and can come back from the brink of death and keep kicking. Just keep trying to eat a variety of foods and plenty of raw fruits and vegetables, and fermented foods like kimchi as well, and your body will heal. You just need to give it time and the right fuel to do so.

Rule number one
Stop purging
Easier said than done. But the filling you have will erode and fall out, causing you to need LARGER fillings or root canals or crowns on those teeth
Rule number two
If you relapse and purge, do not brush your teeth immediately after. The stomach acid will abrade the tooth enamel when brushed. After purging rinse your mouth with plain water thoroughly, and wait at least a half hour before using tooth paste and brushing or any mouth rinses
Rule number three
Use a fluoride rinse daily before bed. No eating or drinking or rinsing for 30 minutes after use to ensure the fluoride is properly bathing your teeth. This will strengthen enamel and prevent new decay
Rule number 4
Oral hygiene routine... floss, then brush then rinse with fluoride

It started with cheetos puffs and went from there. I liked the feeling I got being /really/ full.

As far as the purging goes, that started about six months ago, my depression/anxiety had been really bad and after a particularly large binge, I made myself throw up and I felt a kind of 'high' from it, I guess. I felt in control again, a feeling I'd been missing for the past few months, even with my binging. 

As far as a trigger/what's going through my head, for me it's anxiety induced, more than anything. If I'm super anxious, I tend to binge and then I feel guilty for binging and purge. For me, there's a weird kind of high that goes with purging and 'clearing' yourself out, it's a sense of control. I mostly do the binge/purge cycle at home, or when I'm alone. I've purged at work a few times, I work at a school and go to the furthest staff bathroom for one person I can and do it there. 

Like others said, it's such a complex thing, it's hard to just pin it down to a few specifics.

Yes, I'm aware she was hospitalized for a drug overdose, but as a person who suffers from an ED as well as a substance problem (currently alcohol, though I've had an issue with with weed and MDMA in the past), I understand the escapism that both of these diseases offer and they are often related when someone suffers from both at once, or moves from one to the other. When is comes to substance abuse and EDs, our demons are often the same: that nagging voice that tells you that you'll never be the image of perfection that you so desperately want to be, which you believe, and so resort to self-destructive behavior as a form of escape/relief/punishment. I can only imagine how difficult that is for someone who is in the spotlight and public eye, constantly being judged... I know that my psyche certainly is not capable of handling that...

I think I'm particularly upset about this because a few nights ago, I had stumbled across an old article about her from a few years back where she was proudly flaunting her 'flaws', and in the comments section people were saying crap like, ""People need to stop calling her brave for doing this, she's a beautiful celebrity!"" etc etc, not realizing that she once suffered from bulimia and so what she was doing was incredibly brave, beyond their comprehension.

And now this... I'm just so upset for her. Obviously, she is still battling *something*.

ANYWAY. Talking about drunk purging.... I just had a binge, and certainly included a few hard iced teas along with it. Purigng drunk either happens one of two ways with me:

1. I include alcohol in my binge (allowing myself a few minutes to let the alcohol seep into my blood before purging the remainder of it)
2. I get drunk, and that causes me to go on a binge (because hey, drunk munchies are real).

Like all mental illnesses, eds are complicated and diverse (even within just one sufferer). For example, depending on what happened, being upset can either trigger me binging and purging for hours, or can trigger a fast. I can binge and purge when I’m in a good mood, because “why the f not, right?” or “yeah, I’ve earned this.” Or when I’m frustrated because “at least it’ll make me feel better”. After the first or second binge and purge I usually feel fine, like the equivalent to playing the sims and they’re feeling “fine” with the gray background. Just fine, usually. After the third, I really start to hate myself, and it just multiplies after that (imagine doing that 10+ times a day though, oof). Most days I go for as long as I can without binging or purging. I carefully decide when and what to eat, drink a lot of water, and when the urges get real bad I feel like an addict, scratching at my skin, shivering, begging for a fix.

LucySparky,1382327357.0,,,,t2_dl8th,"Honestly, this is such a complex illness, I can't just tell you the emotions I feel after or before binging and purging.

When the purging started I felt powerful and in control. Now if I purge, I feel guilty for ruining my teeth, disappointed in myself, ashamed, and sometimes right and in control. Sometimes I still feel a 'high' off of it. It just depends on the situation and when and what is happening in my life, stressful situation or not. We're not just a disorder, we're people with complex emotions and a distorted thought process. People will feel differently.

Before a binge, it was different whether I anticipated purging or trying not to. If I don't purge after a binge I feel very stressed and anxious but it will pass. During a binge I always feel like I can't stop and I have to have more, always, I'm even aware I'm in a binge, I just can't stop myself. I don't know why. I started binging when I was 13 and even then it felt so different from normal eating or overeating, it was so much and so extreme even at 13 I didn't know what it was, I knew it was something I couldn't stop.

Before a binge, now, after learning to realize in advance yes I want to binge, I find a way to try and justify it.

I myself got scared straight by the facts.

Facts being that you can die because of electrolytes being purged. They govern your heartbeat you know. Rotting teeth, and the fact that you still absorb calories so it will make you fatter anyways. And don't forget the fact that you're wasting money!

I was just telling you what works for me, and definitely **not** trying to put you down whatsoever. I don't know who you are or what you do, and I am not  a licensed psychologist, but I couldn't help but notice that you said you were mentally stable a few times.

Trauma.

When someone thinks of Trauma, they tend to think of it as some horrendous abuse that they wouldn't wish on their worst enemy. Yet, it is relative. When you are traumatized relative to your life experience you will act out in many ways.

You and I both are not starving africans, to us that's abuse. However you may have been ignored as a child or something that you wouldn't think of anyways, and it may have delved deep into your psyche.

Ignore that last bit, I got romantic and speculating. For me (and honestly, it's the only way I can relate to you any part of this disorder at this moment until I read more about it), it has always been control. Hell I was finally fit and I had a beautiful girlfriend and everything was going right and I still vomited on occasion. This is a coping mechanism for a trigger, and you gotta identify that trigger. You gotta resolve your issues! Until then it may progress, and I, an internet stranger, do not wish that of yourself, because you sound smart and capable.

In fact, most of here sound smart and capable to me, but have this weighing down on our shoulders, and it's kind of terrifying how it can creep in. But you know, I suffer from the same thing and I know *exactly* what you are going through.

I ruminated on this today, and you make some good points. I definitely saw the whole artistry of personifying your mental illness, but I totally took it seriously like I do everything else XD, so I may have come across as a bit harsh, which I apologise for.

For me, realising that it is outside myself as opposed to embedded in me means that I don't do anything to rid myself of the issue. It's another person who wants to stay there and there is nothing I can do to change that.

Think about it. This disease always comes with some sort of trauma in the background, and on top of that there is always issues with your body, esteem and confidence and assertion issues. If you have to face another ""person"" so to speak that will attack your very being, do you think you will be able to stand up to it and say no?

I'm not, and thats what I mean by shirking responsibility. It's not me, its that demon, and I can't do anything about that demon. Luckily its my subjective meatsack of a brain that I am able to frame differently if I so desire and I choose to via abstracting my illness; reducing it to its basic element. Like programming, breaking each problem down and down. That has a whole other tangent of algorithmically fixing your mind and inadvertently trying to apply it to life but will always fail...

And thats also it, when you separate your illness from yourself you are eliminating any consistency and memories/actions that have lead you to your current moment. You don't see your life with any sort of meta cognition, because we can't read minds :P",,,1513215240,,,dr7vlln,,t3_7j28zw,,,t1_dr6j8y6,/r/bulimia/comments/7j28zw/who_would_your_edmonster_be/dr7vlln/,,1513215242,1,,,False,bulimia,t5_2tmc8,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",,,,,,,,,,,,

My advice is whenever possible just continue to love her for who she is. When she looks in the mirror, she probably just sees the disorder. Don’t reinforce that by constantly talking about it.

After some studying of Jung psychology (which admittedly is more spiritual than psychology at some parts, but very insightful) I realised that what i was doing was giving a face that I can confront rather than an abstract object. I find that this gives me a... way to shirk responsibility, rather than accepting the trauma embedded inside me, I moved it outside of myself that latched on.

This is similar. I wrote that to add on to your post, and to do a little test. I don't like it. Personification leads to shirking responsibility for me.

This is an developed coping mechanism for all the trauma that has affected me, and since its so well enveloped inside me, its become a rather instinctual choice for even minor stresses. It is not a face, it is not an object outside of myself. It is the result of neurons firing because they are so used to it; what I must do is face it with therapy and journaling and writing.

Purging seems to work to start with - everyone experiences that. As someone else mentioned, it’s often due to dehydration. You seem to lose weight. But once you purge with any regularity, you’ll start putting on weight because the calories gained from bingeing will outweigh what you can purge. That’s why bulimics are most often at a normal weight, or overweight.

Stop purging now. Just eat. 10 lbs means nothing. Get revenge on your bullies by enjoying your life, not by skulking in toilets, puking and hating yourself. It’s no way to live, I promise you that.

I have only had a “mild” eating disorder. In that, I’ve never needed hospitalisation or anything. I have teeth that have broken off, persistent reflux disease, gallstones from having lost weight too fast, bad breath, I’ve wasted so much of my muscle that I did a body fat measure at my current weight and I’m 39% body fat because I wrecked all of my muscles.

It did not help me with my eating disorder at all from what I remember, however I’m pretty sure I never took it consistently (or at least not consistently for a useful amount of time). I always had a problem with taking medication on time or even at all every day. I forget or get into a mood where I either give up on the med or feel like I’m cured and don’t need it. Needless to say, that’s an issue when taking any SSRI. Prozac also induced manic episodes for me (I’m bipolar but that wasn’t known at the time). 

Overall, I did not like Prozac, but my experience probably isn’t too reliable.

newhope124,,,,,,"Hello, Thank you for the question.  Treatment or intervention requires an interdisciplinary approach, usually with a therapist, dietitian, physician, and possibly psychiatrist.  CBT and interpersonal therapy and family therapy have been helpful.  The psychiatrist can provide recommendations for medications that are used and ones that should not be used.  The client is taught how to eat a structured meal plan with regular/structured eating throughout the day.  This can help to eliminate the binge/purge cycle.  Therapy focuses on changing negative belief patterns, attitudes, and feelings.  The binge/purge behaviors are used to help cope with the negative emotions.  The interventions are aimed to teach the client how to cope with healthier alternatives.  It is also helpful to identify patterns in the cycle and interrupt it.  For example, does the client usually engage in the behaviors after work or school?  If so, then help the client break the cycle by placing something new in the routine or placing a barrier between the binge/purge.  The clients usually deal with guilt, shame, and denial over their behaviors.  It is important ti acknowledge this and not be too confrontational.  Resistance is part of the disease, not the client.  Successful- helping the client find pleasure and a life outside of the eating disorder and establishing a normal eating routine so he/she is not hungry and vulnerable to the behavior.  Additionally, acknowledging the progress, understanding the slips/relapse are part of the process, and patience.  The APA has published a great set of practice guidelines.

For future reference when commenting, please consider that as someone who hasn't been exposed to a lot of these problems and is trying to understand what's going on, hostility doesn't help convey the perspective I might need. I think u/meow_gusta took a really great approach.

To clear up some of the misconceptions about the situation I did not threaten to tell my parents. She gave me permission to discuss the situation with them months ago and they have known. Additionally, it was less of a threat to tell her parents and always an open discussion.  From my story it is obvious that she did not take that discussion well but we have since talked, I apologized for creating a stressful situation and she admitted she overreacted. Given her worsening condition this semester and the lack of people that  know what she's going through, my only goal was to have someone close to her (whether that be professional or familial) be able to make sure she was alright. I made that clear to her.

I had spoken with nurses and a few friends who dealt with this in their families. They all said after the parents were informed they received proper care and help that led to a relatively quick recovery. From their advice I made the decision to discuss that with her. Which was not something I wanted to do. Besides that one conversation I have done nothing but reach out to communities and gather information about possible avenues to help.

Again, thank you for your input but in the future please consider less hostility. It helps someone like me understand what I need to and from your perspective there may be more nuance to the situation than meets the eye.

5318391,,,,,,"Couldn't agree with this more. Please find someone who specializes in eating disorders. It is unlikely they will give you such a rigid calorie count, as calorie requirements are unique to each individual and it is MUCH more important for you to stop purging than to be completely adherent to a certain number of calories. It may also be helpful to tell your dietitian that you are struggling with that few calories and they may add some snacks/larger portions. 

Keep in mind that the first few weeks of a meal plan will be really challenging because your hunger/fullness cues are unreliable and your hormones are likely imbalanced. Over time, this will stabilize but it is important to make sure you are getting enough energy to heal and damage done and feel satisfied !!

5318391,,,,,,"Really sorry to hear you are going through a tough time right now. I know what it's like to struggle with purging in times of stress and how shitty it feels to fall back into old behaviours after a long period of recovery. I don't know if you will find this helpful but if I could give you one piece of advice it would be to give yourself a break! We tend to beat ourselves up so much for slips, when we should just use these experiences to learn and make changes for the future. I listened to a podcast the other day and they said ""the only true mistakes are those that you don't try to learn from"". In order to move past my eating disorder, I had to let go of all the guilt/shame/self resentment that I was holding onto. 

In terms of coping strategies, I have found medication/therapy/journaling to be helpful but have also found it extremely important to have peer support (others who have been through the same thing/are in recovery) to vent to in times of need. Things like delaying the behaviours, finding hobbies, etc help but having a strong support network who I could talk openly with was absolutely key!

Remember, just because you had ED symptoms today, doesn't mean you have to tomorrow. It's a new day and a fresh start! Recovery is really hard but gets a lot easier and more rewarding over time😊.

5318391,,,,,,"Hey! It's amazing to hear that you feel ready to fight your eating disorder - you sound incredibly motivated to get your life back! I am in a similar boat to you. I am 28 and have had an eating disorder for about 17 years (on and off, b/p subtype for nearly 15 of these). It has drastically impacted my career, my relationships, and countless other things - let's just say, it has ruined almost every good thing in my life and I'm so glad to be in recovery now. Trust me, it's worth it! 

I had a lot of health issues arise during/after the height of my eating disorder and things are still popping up a year later... I feel your pain with the dental issues and I've had major kidney issues recently. However, please don't let this discourage you! The body has an incredible ability to heal itself, if you let it. I think some of the thoughts you are having about slipping back into old behaviours are coming from the eating disorder, itself. Don't trust that voice, it has never led you (or me) to a good place!! Keep your head up and continue to do what you've been doing.
