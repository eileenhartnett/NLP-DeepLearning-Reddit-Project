Don't know what everyone's worried about."" - my favourite meepo line


However sometimes I'll get ganked over and over. They won't stop finding me. They'll smoke into my sacred jungle, they all take my stacks and put up vision. They'll watch my movements and predict where I'll be. I'm so behind, how can I win? There's so many of me yet numbers don't matter anymore, no mental exercises will overcome their persistence. I lose this game today.. but I do try later.

I've not long left a job that I split on. And I'm currently working 2 because the idea of committing to one is terrifying. That helped me a lot, the idea of having some control. A safety net kind of idea.

What I've done is work 15hrs in a job that I'm passionate about, something that motivates me and then I make up the rest of my hours with agency work. Something that let's me choose my availability. So if I take a dip I can just not put in my availability that week and take more time for myself, or if I'm ready to throw myself into it I have the ability to do that as well.

I think with BPD the idea of losing everything is terrifying, if you lose this job your fucked plays through your mind a lot more. But if you feel like you have more control that might help.

Then again we're all different and we all have different solutions to these things, theres nothing wrong if you dont think this will work for you. Regarding your current state, it's all going to be okay and BPD makes everything feel so much more high risk. Theres nothing wrong with leaving environments that dont create a healthy space for you and theres nothing wrong with being off work when you feel this way.

,NayrEnvy,,,[],,,,text,t2_35nb5esn,False,,"The first thing I would advise is to look for of course any local help you can get whether that be for example on  the NHS if you're British or possibly trying to acquire funding from somewhere to possibly book a private psychiatrist (could be costly). See if there is an early intervention team wherever you are at to deal with any immediate things such as suicidal thoughts etc. but in no uncertain terms say you have these thoughts if you don't because you may prevent someone else from getting the help they urgently need. You may be prescribed sertraline or venlafaxine for the depression and anxiety in this case and it'll take a couple weeks to begin to work.

&amp;#x200B;

You have done well making the proactive decision to seek help through an email but if you are going to university; maybe try to look up what they have setup where your university is. I imagine (this wasn't the case for me) that if you have suffered any trauma e.g. physical/sexual abuse that they will be more inclined to see you at an earlier age for a diagnosis for BPD. People with BPD can often get diagnosed with other things such as bipolar were both symptoms overlap to an extent and they even coexist together (this is called comorbidity). So do not get frustrated if you are misdiagnosed, if you think or experience something that doesn't quite match up... you need to let your therapist/doctor/whoever know and you may even need to get a second opinion from another psychologist/psychiatrist.

&amp;#x200B;

Another proactive thing to do is write down everything you want to say. If you are stripped for cash and can only manage to book that one private appointment, providing enough information as you can in that appointment might be **very important;** you more than likely would not get diagnosed straight away from 1 meeting so please be prepared for that. Diagnosing is a process, usually over 5-6 weeks of multiple visits which can vary.  


Another thing you could do is see if they have any support through the university you're attending, I know that some provide information and/or services that you could maybe take advantage of even if it means still paying for them... you may find that they come at a cheaper price.

&amp;#x200B;

Waiting lists are not fun by no means but if you can get on the waiting list for something near the university, by the time you get there you can transition and start the counselling. As much as we all wished everything worked out perfectly in our life - a lot of things don't go to plan \*spoiler\* - do not be discouraged from seeking help by the ridiculous amount of time you need to wait to be seen to! If needs be and it's possible, see if you can make the trip to attend even just 1 counselling meeting (near to your home) just to get some more information on what you need, they may be able to help with that! (If possible of course)

,hmm____ass,,,[],,,,text,t2_1b9cckt,False,,"Thank you for such an amazing response, I’m not alone in this and neither are you. 

I’ve been really wanting to get into DBT, I bought a DBT book and did a few pages, but it didn’t help me too much because I’m an auditory learner. I think the only thing that will help me is in-person guidance with DBT and since my insurance doesn’t cover therapy, I can’t afford to pay $150 (no lie) each session. 

It’s so hard for me to take a step back and tell myself that I’m over analyzing something because I also have pure O-OCD, I feel like I don’t deserve to show myself any compassion because I’m not progressing the way I’d like. I grew up in a competitive family which made me develop this compulsiveness to always strive for better and fixate/plan everything I need to do to make it work, and I made it work. But ever since my BPD crept up, it’s stolen all the drive I have to make what I want to achieve a reality and my life has gone to shit.. no matter how much time I take to plan out things for my future I still fuck it up because it’s an easy way out. 

I feel like I’m stuck in this loop of wanting to do better but not doing better, and my BPD has “matured” overtime so I can’t even control that which is driving me more nuts. I just wish I could pull myself out of this funk and enjoy things again. I have good days where I do enjoy very simple/little things, but most of the time those days end with me being depressed from a mood swing.

My mom has taught me that people accomplish things at their own pace and that it’s “not my time yet”, so I’ve developed a sense of understanding. I just wish my fucking mind would *click* and realize that it’s unhealthy that I’m finding comfort in being depressed because it’s safe and I need to snap the fuck out of it. 

Sorry if I sound so negative, I’m having a really hard time and have been crying all day about how fucked I feel.",1555638450,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",el8gzee,True,t3_bes8oq,,True,t1_el8ejup,/r/BPD/comments/bes8oq/my_mood_swings_are_ruining_my_20s_im_tired_of/el8gzee/,1555638451,4,True,,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,,1555759909.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,NayrEnvy,,,[],,,,text,t2_35nb5esn,False,,"Good side:- passionate, caring, great sex, wants to please you before pleasing themselves, puts you on a pedestal, worships the ground you walk on, personifies you as perfection within their own imagination, wants to be with you a lot of the time, goofy and childlike! In some cases you are the perfection that they cannot become so in being that, you have completed them.

Bad side:- extreme jealousy, manipulative, passive aggressive (internal conflict), verbally abusive, physically abusive (if ruminating infidelity for example), sexually abusive (I imagine there's some cases of this for some), has really bad conflicting and/or intrusive thoughts from perceived rejection, things may get punched like doors etc, abandonment issues. 
Even a sleight such as her smiling at some random guy or them smiling at her could be a trigger for some! Controlling behaviours and trying to change the person to their idealised view etc!

Another part of the bad is the stalking behaviour may manifest itself into going from liking all her statuses to checking who's liked them and then paranoid intrusive thoughts may occur when an argument breaks out which then leads to more arguments about more stupid shit which ruins the relationship and leads to resentment, all or some whilst behind closed doors of course!

Also going from exploding anger to literally being ok because you have released the tension you've built up, well.. a lot of people can't just switch like us so you're left trying to put together the destruction you've just caused. So it's a lot of risk for us and we don't want to hurt women, we love them so much but our crazy makes us say/do stupid shit and we need to take responsibility!

With that in mind, me personally... I have had a lot of intense and unstable relationships. The good times were AMAZING but the bad times takes an emotional and mental toll on the person with and the person without sometimes to a level of no repair! When you're aware of the destruction you can cause... would you wanna risk losing that perfection? Is it better to have love and lost or to love and to have never lost by keeping the same distance between one another?

I have decided for the time being to get myself sorted, evaluate what I can bring to the table and how I can help improve the next important lady in my life's experience with me and have that fairy tale ending!

,bagodando,,,[],,,,text,t2_80yit3,False,,"For me, it was really good. It started with strong emotions, and I was able to laugh and cry, and I couldn't stop talking. I never, ever had a bad trip. And I could distinguish real from not real. I just felt this closeness and unity with my closest friend and the whole world. It was all chaos, I was aware of it, I understood its bad side, but at the same time I felt content because I accepted this was life. It was I was having a conversation with myself, one on one, sitting on a table, facing myself. Having doubts and at the same time solving them. And being aware at all times that I was feeling it, it wasnt like I was drunk or high, it was just this intense feeling of it all being shit but at the same time making sense.   


I've taken them like 5 times in the course of three years, with long gaps between them, the best times were when I knew I could trust the other person I was taking them with. Being able to have someone you can trust and know that if you're having a bad time, they will help, is crucial to the experience. Where you are, who you are with, it has to be safe and good. If not, you can feel paranoid. One time my friend was feeling paranoid because we were meeting other people at a uni dance, I was really secure and content but she was paranoid people would tell she was on shrooms. Even if I was on shrooms, I was able to talk to her and calm her down and say hey, it's okay, we can stay here all night because there's no place I'd rather be than being with my friends. And it calmed her down and then she was fine. After the trip, I still felt the calmness I felt when I took them. It's like something woke up inside me and it stayed with me. But it also made me have some headaches sometimes, and some stomach issues, but that's not bpd related. In my experience, if you trust yourself and accept the experience and emotions, it can be really good. If you're scared or something it won't. It calmed my anxiety and my good/bad view of the world kind of disappeared for some hours, and helped me meditate in the future. Hope my experience helps.

You are definitely getting a good start by finding the positives of the job and trying to get DBT help. I don’t have a strong DBT setup in my city either, so every morning I read a section of the DBT manual - I’ve read it like 100000 times by now lol. If I have any questions about certain techniques, I ask my therapist. She doesn’t do DBT but she knows enough about it to help me understand whatever I have a question on. 

I think with change specifically, the uncertainty of the situation is what causes a lot of the anxiety/fear of abandonment. I would recommend working out a routine with your partner like calling every day at the same time, even if it’s just for 3 minutes to schedule another time for a call (if his or your schedule is unpredictable). And setting up a video chat session at least X amount of times a week at a specific time. Change and separation is a lot easier if you have some consistency to look forward to, which is why it’s important to make sure it is at a specific time. Also, it feels more comforting (to me at least) to know that someone is dedicating time in their schedule for me.

,gurneyhallack,,,[],,,,text,t2_9zkvzo3,False,,"This is normal. I will not say it is the only way people experience BPD, but it is an established thing. Indeed there is a type of therapy predicated on the idea that has a solid evidence base for BPD, schema therapy. It is a real issue with me, I try not to overemphasize it beyond what is there, but ever since therapy, not schema therapy per se but relational, the reality of it is pretty clear.  DID is a particularly serious disorder and the reality of the states is more absolute, that is the only case where the term alters is used though, otherwise modes is the preferred term. 

There are about 10 modes in schema theory, 4 child states, the vulnerable, angry, impulsive and contented. As well there are 3 maladaptive coping modes that do not correspond to a age type, compliant surrenderer, detached protector, and overcompensator. As well as 3 adult or parental modes, punitive parent, demanding or critical parent, and healthy adult. These are metaphorical states of course, but in some cases of BPD, CPTSD, and such and can be pretty darned real. They are related to dissociation though how is poorly understood and are almost invariably caused by childhood trauma. 

That is the person can realize ans see they are not real technically, but in practice they are really different methods of thinking and acting that do not seem easy at all to control, either when they come about or when they switch off. I can see elements of all of these in myself, but then it is likely that many people have elements of these, only the vulnerable and angry child, the complaint surrenderer and detached protector, punitive parent, and to some extent since therapy the healthy adult, are realities in my own self as meaningful states, I do not look for other states as it seems foolish to create more issues where they are not yet obvious. 

These things come about as a defense without my awareness, and even when I become aware are nearly impossible to switch off. The issue is, as with most people with schema modes, it doesn't generally switch off with awareness unless the person has learned an enormous amount and accessed a healthy adult mode, otherwise it tends to simply switch from a mode that ""isn't working"", of course none of them but the healthy adult actually work well, to another mode. 

Becoming more and more capable of realizing what is going on and switching to healthy adult is possible without the swings between other problematic coping modes can become more and more possible with therapy, though in truth it is difficult. As you say they are not real, we can see it is a character or theoretical idea, yet it can become a way if being during times of stress or when a person is afraid for whatever reason that is quite difficult, because these modes are children or adults who respond poorly to others and make poor decisions it can be an issue. I find the theory to be quite helpful, it speaks to something that seems pretty clearly a lived reality well also being a way to conceptualize the issue that can help.

,VeldigVeldigViktig,,,,,,,,t2_asukdix,,,"So, I think that this is pretty common even for non-BPD people. Romantic relationships are intense, scary things. I bet that you're not as abnormally self-sabotaging as you think. It makes sense that you're scared about his feelings changing. Feelings DO change after all, and after what you've been through in that previous relationship, it makes sense that you'd be nervous.

Have you been in DBT at all? DBT all the way. I've been in DBT for the last year and a half or so, and I wouldn't say I've pulled a full 180° on the neurotic, assurance-seeking, push-pull behavior, but have accomplished something like a 174°, which is a more profound  improvement than I ever would've imagined. 

So, please seek out DBT. It's designed for us and it's really powerful, or at least it was for me. 

In the meantime my best advice is this: your jealousy, fear storms are physiological events more than they're psychological events. Your muscles tense and your skin gets hot and your breath gets shallow and your heart-rate speeds up, or whatever it is for you. It's not just a thought that you're having, right? It's more like this thing that has you. 

I used to try to think or talk my way out of these states, but try to ignore the mental content(the thoughts, feelings, fears, jealousies, stories) that come with the feeling and develop methods for dealing with the physiological state. I go in the pool in winter or an ice bath in spring and summer and it's like a total reboot. The cold is amazing. My motto is: ""the cold makes a Buddha out of everyone."" It sucks getting in, but it's worth it. If I'm especially upset and don't have time to throw my trunks on, I'll just dunk my head in the water a few times. A hot sauna has a similar effect. As does a nice long walk or run or massage. Change your physiological state first and then see if your feelings are still there. 

Often, they'll be totally gone and there will be this sense of clarity, ""Oh right. He totally loves me. I know that. I was just dysregulated."" Because you obviously know that he. The problem is that when we're dysregulated and upset our BPD has a way of magnifying our negative thoughts which makes us more dysregulated which increases our black-and-white thinking which magnifies the negativity even more which further dysregulates us which increases black-and-white thinking...and so what starts as a little ""huh...he didn't text me after work like he said he was going to"" can become, ""No one will ever love me and I'll ruin every relationship I'm ever in ever. I'll ruin everything I ever do,"" in a like two minutes. 

Having the fear or the disappointment is universal, but that rapid amplification of the feeling seems specifically Borderline. These are deeply ingrained thought patterns. They are powerful and we have very little hope of stopping them with our minds. What the cold or hot or exercise does is break the circuit so that the negativity can't grow so wildly and overwhelm us so quickly. 

And then, you'll likely be in a state of mind where you can express yourself, even your disappointment without sounding  or feeling needy. ""Hey, I was looking forward to talking to you. Text me when you can,"" or ""Hey, I know it's silly, but I worry when I don't hear from you."" Just because you have borderline doesn't meant you don't have needs. I know that impulse well, where I'm like, ""I'm being too needy. From now on, I'll just be a badass stoic who doesn't have any needs at all and never complains or asks for anything,"" but this doesn't work, or never did for me, because then you act like a werido and you build up resentment because you're not asking for what you need. 

Relationships are tricky dances, and it can feel like as a person with BPD you're romantically doomed, but really we are sensitive, empathetic, creative people. You bring so much good stuff to the table as someone with BPD. It can be frustrating, and feel hopeless, but honestly you sound like you're not too far away from having a healthy relationship, especially considering how far you've come. Keep going. You're gonna get better. And you're gonna mess up too, so look up stuff on validating yourself. That's another huge piece of advice: practice validating yourself. This video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDSIYTQX_dk is a really good overview about validation. Actually learning to validate others has probably had the most profound impact on my relationships. 

Okay, I wrote too much, but if you have any questions please ask them.

But anyway, I kinda suspect for other reasons she might be on the bpd spectrum (over sharing, childhood trauma, emotionally immature, reactive, etc.), which actually worries me.

I hope you find a friend. They probably won't be like you that way, but that doesn't mean they won't love you. You sound like more of an extroverted bpd, whereas I am introverted.

,gurneyhallack,,,,,,,,t2_9zkvzo3,,,"I am trying to grieve that person in therapy right now. I understand how you feel, I think. The therapist says I have to understand that due to my sincerely messed up childhood, which has led to the cptsd and bpd traits, depression, anxiety and SUD's, that sitting on the couch and hiding with the bong was the only way I felt safe. 

That I have to forgive myself for wasting the last twenty years, that in my situation I barely had a choice, or knowledge I could be different. But it breaks my heart. I am almost 37, I have never had a job or a drivers license or a date or an education. I have moved every year on average. 

Now I am getting it together. Getting my GED, have a part time job, am able to do self care like a normal person, almost. But I have to try to move forward based solely on hope. I have no lived experience of success in anything. I have to try to accept the wasted years. I just hate all those people who hurt and broke me to make me like this, who took those years from me as I hid from life in fear. And I hate myself for being so weak, for waiting so long to try. 

At this point I am trying to become someone I don't hate. I am paying a quarter of my entire income for therapy and it is helping, she is really good at her job. But it has been thirty odd sessions and I can't be sure I will ever accept the past, or forgive myself. But I do have the power not to be someone I hate in the future, I think. 

I will hold that in my heart for you. That you learn to create the person you want to be.  Don't envy the normal more than you can avoid. The therapist keeps saying this, she meets with lots of normal people. Many of them are just as sad and angry and bitter as us. They just found socially acceptable ways of dealing, closing themselves off in many cases to actual happiness or even understanding of what is wrong. 

It is a terrible burden, but we can feel with an intensity that allows us to never forget something is wrong. It allows us to actually be capable of change throughout our lives, if only because of desperation. We can have a level of self knowledge and contentment others don't, if we make it through the fire. Many don't of course, and it is an awful thing to see. 

But even if we don't make it through the fire, we love intensely, and nobody can say we were boring people with boring lives.

If you are close to her, that sucks, but sometimes its good to push toxic people to the edges of our daily lives. Keep moving forward, it sounds like you have really great supportive people in your life. Focus on them, focus on you. Your mom is an adult and will have to deal with the fact you are too. 

I often relate to this one Bob's Burgers episode (lovely, happy show if you haven't seen it) where the main character can only be around his father for 10-15 at a time before things gets weird and uncomfortable. Its sometimes a good idea to do this with hurtful family. Invite them out for lunch or to the movies to keep the relationship up, but then at that point your relationship with this family member is on your terms.

If you decide to stop taking any meds after one day or one week because of the side effect, you will never get the positive effects from any meds.

My advice: even if the side effects are horrible, power through them for at least two weeks and if they don’t let up, then the meds aren’t for you.

,ImNotWearingAHat,,,,,,,,,,,"I understand that feeling shunted out of relaxation is terrible, but again I think expectations are an issue here.

Is it really reasonable to expect other people, especially strangers, to have an idea of what it takes for you to feel okay? I would argue that it isn't. 

Others can't read your mind; they can only rely on external cues or you clearly expressing how you feel. Even then, their ability to interpret cues or what you say is very contingent on a number of other things (whether they know you, how empathetic they are, their own mental state, whether they've had a terrible day too, and on it goes). Expecting others to do follow the exact protocol that you require in order to not have your expectations violated (especially in the absence of instructions) is a train (or bus) destined to arrive at disappointment.

On the 'ruining' - let's unpack that a bit. Is it really them who have ruined it? Where did the ruining take place? Is it something that is out there in the world? Like your bus seat? No, it isn't. It's an event that is confined to your mind, and how you have positioned yourself in relation to the events around you. 

The world, the people in it, and the events that take place among them are what they are - you have very limited ability to control what happens. Trying to control what happens - especially where other people are concerned - is also not a terrific idea. This is where the BPD spiral comes in - in trying to control others and reduce your own uncertainty, they are pushed away and loneliness is what follows (it also validates all those fears of abandonment; a self fulfilling prophecy).

You can't control what happens around you. You can work on massaging your reactions to what other people do into a more healthy place. Back to the 'ruining' - it might be hard to hear but that particular incidence of your world being ruined was a choice you made about how to respond to a situation. A choice that you can learn to make differently, even if it isn't easy to do so.",1519338244,,duoc49k,False,t3_7zaoaz,,,t1_dunkxkm,/r/BPD/comments/7zaoaz/does_anyone_else_experience_rage_over_little/duoc49k/,1520136125,1,,,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,,,,,,True,,,0.0,0.0,3.0,24824.0,,public,,,,,,,,

If you feel so bad that you feel sick, you gotta disconnect. Turn off your phone. Or turn off notifications for apps that keep notifying you of things that are happening. You need to take a vacation from your life right now, even if you can’t leave the country, and even if it’s just for tonight, you need to take a vacation where only you are invited. No painful thoughts are allowed to dwell there, only your favourite things, because your heart just took a massive beating and it’s in the ICU.  So if while you’re on vacation, you get a shitty thought, imagine that it’s a kook with no credibility, and tell it “hm, ok, that’s nice. Goodbye now!”  Maybe you’ll have to do that 10,000 times, so do it 10,000 times. Acknowledge it, then give it the boot, because you have to heal right now. You’ll remedy the situation when you feel better, and you’ll know when you’re ready. 

Lose yourself in a movie for a show that you haven’t seen before, or maybe an oldie but goodie, but lose yourself in it. You could even lose yourself in a book. But whatever you do, take a mental vacation from this for a few hours. What helps me when I feel like shit is going as hard as I can on a treadmill or elliptical. But sometimes I can’t do that so I do YouTube workouts that don’t require much space or equipment. Doing intense exercise physically releases anxiety from my body. You gotta take time for yourself to find your outlet, but you will find one that’s perfect for you. 

I felt sick like that before from stress but I’ve never actually thrown up. The trick is to take a mental vacation where you do awesome and kind things for yourself. Take a bubble bath. Eat some pizza. Do anything that makes you not think of what happened because you’re on mental vacation. 

I hope this helps :( you can DM me if you want to, too. ",1533873264,,e3xiyu3,False,t3_9634j3,,False,t3_9634j3,/r/BPD/comments/9634j3/my_first_ever_fp_dumped_me/e3xiyu3/,1537314712,4,True,,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,,,,,1520658077.0,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1.0,3993.0,r/BPD,public,,1533873649.0,,,,,,

See, your post reaffirms my ongoing plan of isolation from dating while I piece together my identity. After several months, I feel like I’ve made a lot of progress. However, I had essentially been doing that my whole life, long before I started trying to understand my mental state. 

Driven by various fears, and a general dis-interest in the women/girls around me, I never engaged in a legitimate romantic relationship. I’ve had barely a handful of physical encounters, few of them escalating to sex, and none of them ever leading to a second encounter. 

Now I’m at the point where I’ve never experienced romantic love (frankly I don’t know if it exists), I have have a very low sex drive, and am completely inept at the dating game. 

I’m afraid if I ever do find a women really interests me, my inexperience/lack of romantic emotion will be my undoing. But the only way for me to get experience right now would be to engage in a relationship with someone I don’t want to be with. And that’s basically what I’ve been trying to avoid this whole time.

So I know being patient is what I should do, but goddammit I’m so sick of waiting.

I always make a disclaimer when I post here that I am not even remotely close to being diagnosed, and I haven't even felt too pressured to try to understand if BPD is something I truly experience. I've never understood quite enough about it to pursue a diagnosis or anything. Ultimately that's a label and maybe I would qualify for that label, maybe I wouldn't.  What I do know is what my issues are and the magnitude with which they destroy my happiness and a few of the most important relationships I've had.  Like you, I find that without the affection and intimacy of another person, nothing else matters. I won't even bother to elaborate on that or stretch out how much I identify with that. It's as simple as that. But when I'm trading affection and companionship with someone I like a lot, it simply turns my world around and I feel like a king. When I'm with someone who truly becomes my ""favorite"", they really reinforce that sense of significance and I just couldn't possibly find anything that makes me happier or more complete.  But I put all my eggs into one emotional basket and without prediction or restraint, I will inevitably do something so emotionally driven to essentially swing that basket around in the air like a fucking helicopter blade and smash all my eggs into dust particles. And it's all over.  Prior to that point it can be the most wonderful thing between two people.  I can hardly believe it's even real it's so good.  They fall for me, I fall for them, and the world feels like its dealt me a good hand for a change. But I end up alone after all, because I can't just be a better person when I need to. I allow short episodes of emotional foolishness to redefine the otherwise awesome, intimate and affectionate companion I'm capable of being.

Whether I'm truly BPD or not remains to be determined. For now I know my issues and I always find myself here relating to and identifying with what I read so well. It's always been a sub that speaks to me and I feel like I just want to be everyone's friend here because I just get it, and don't have anyone in my life that I'm aware of who gets it. And I have yet to meet someone who can withstand my issues and maintain belief that there is still much more to me than who I become.  They forget who I am and who I was and walk away knowing me as a pathetic monster. 

This has been haunting and following me through my entire adulthood in some way. I just hope for healing and another chance.

First of all, I'm super happy you're considering getting help. You deserve to be happy just as much as anyone else, sometimes medical intervention can help!

I was in the emergency department numerous times for mental health issues. I'll tell you about my first time!

The very first time I saw a counselor at my school, they called the hospital and sent me over. I sat in the waiting room for hours before being seen. Looking back, this isn't very safe. I saw an emergency room doctor who asked a few general questions, like if I did drugs and issues regarding my physical health. He asked me if I'd like to see a psychiatrist, everything was 100&amp;#37; on my terms. They brought me to the psych department where everything was chained to the floors. There were security guards watching through the cameras, I waited a few more hours. Eventually I had a psych eval, received a diagnosis and they gave me a taxi coupon to go home.

Overall, I wasn't treated for my suicidal thoughts. However I was connected to a psychologist who honestly changed my life. It wasn't fun in the moment, but super super important long term.

With my children I am one way (imperfect, the stricter parent but I admit my mistakes and make it a point to play, talk and try to be emotionally present with them)

Have been sober over a year now but have also separated.

With a friend who alternates between very distant and very close, I am delighted when I am around them and dive into a spiral when they go. They don’t know this. I don’t show it. I knew from the beginning that my emotional needs had no space in this friendship. 

With my bestie I am most myself. Raw, sharply funny (to her at least), affectionate, playful.

At work, I try to keep my mouth shut and just work. I have so much drama inside, it’s best it doesn’t spill out there. I don’t have any boundaries and keep saying yes to extra shifts and responsibilities that I don’t have the confidence or energy for. I work hard and do my best but secretly I kind of hope he lets me go.

Alone, mostly I just feel tired and sad. With moments of organized, creative brilliance.

Fucking ditto

I'm on this sub, as well as /r/aspergirls. I identify equally with both (neither is a perfect match, but they both ring a lot of bells). It's *very* annoying

I go back and forth on this all the time. My counsellor says it's basically a toss-up between bipolar + ASD, or BPD on its own. I'm essentially a borderline case for borderline (I don't have the stormy relationships, and I'm not terribly impulsive). I'm the kind of person who's very direct, and can often miss subtext. I like people to speak their minds to me, so I speak my mind to them (which gets me into trouble a lot). One could argue that this is a sign of ASD, because I can't read people well enough to understand what they might be hinting at. One could equally argue that it's a sign of BPD, as my directness could be seen as a lack of consideration for others, my failure to notice subtext could be due to difficulty empathising with others, and my need for clear objective statements could stem from a general mistrust of people.

If you find a resource that helps distinguish between the two, please let me know.

,smudge_173,,,,,,,,t2_3n3yzqw,,,"Thank you for this. It's appreciated.

I had a traumatic childhood that ticks all the BPD boxes, due to my dad - who is similar and I expect also has BPD or is on the spectrum.

It's just really confusing to me trying to figure this out. Many things attributed in my diagnosis could be (and after my reading tonight strongly feel) BPD instead.

The distinctions I need to think about between the two are social awareness, verbal communication (according to my diagnosis, I struggle with abstract language and prefer using concrete language instead. I don't know if BPD also shares this quality), sensitivity to others emotions (I am highly sensitive and everything I've read about BPD makes sense in this area).

I just feel like one moment I'm saying ""one point to BPD"" and then the next ""one point to Aspergers"".

Doesn't help that it seems you can have **both.** But some of the distinctions feel a little contradictory.

Got a lot of reading, soul searching and self reflection to do... Haha.

But people go through the same stuff and DON'T abuse people or do and ARE accountable.

You know what some psychosis is for people?  Believing they are an incarnation of god and being recklessly benevolent.  Believing they are under attack and shutting themselves up in their room and not talking to anyone.  Believing they are a bird and making people uncomfortable.

I'll say this:  I have been psychotic and been really overbearing before, but ultimately that is for me to put in check and make sure not to happen again.  When you are psychotic and fuck up, you have to pick up the pieces afterwards.

And also, I suffer in silence in shame and ideate over stuff I've done all the time.  That's honestly a healthy response to having fucked up, much more healthy than blaming others or a mental illness or denying it or acknowledging but in destructive ways or centering it instead of centering making the situation better.  It shows on some level that we care about what's right, as long as we handle our shame in ethical ways.  And we will live with that for the rest of our lives.  It becomes easier, but it's going to be there.

But it's up to you what it does for you.  It can be a rock on your chest when you go to sleep at night, or it can be a crystal you grow with your own blood to give to others.

Or it can be something that you let animate you and fill your heart with a renewed drive to do good.

Through many conversations with me and with other people, though, she came to the conclusion that she actually has BPD (and is now diagnosed as having that). The conclusion came from the fact that she has an extensive trauma history and that she is significantly helped by therapy. As far as I know, there is no research that suggests that autism spectrum disorders are caused by any kind of trauma, and things like EMDR and talk therapy are not as far as I can tell indicated for ASDs specifically (though certainly for comorbid conditions). I may be mistaken, though. In any event, all this together seems to indicate BPD and her psychiatrist agrees. 

Since then, we've met many people who are children of people with BPD (as my partner is) or of people with NPD, and many think they may be on the spectrum. However, and this is just anecdotal, we suspect they are living with the effects of early childhood trauma rather than ASDs.

I'm not a big believer in the DSM either, it's a changing manual. A tool and that's it.

Also, I enjoy this dialogue. Pardon if I come across as emotional. 

I have a bit of an issue with psychologists understanding of these disorders as I went to school for Neuroscience and try to stay away from speculative thinking; I'm more of a functionalist. The DSM is constantly changing because they're looking at behavior and making their best guess from that. And we know from experience that they aren't making very good guesses. 

I understand the appeal of categorizing people into ""orderly"" and ""disorderly"" subcategories but what I'm talking about here is challenging that notion. 

We already know that a drug addict is better cured when their life is cured. We know that addiction has next to nothing to do with what chemical it is and everything to do with how much they need stimulation. 

I am asserting the idea, from my anectotal experience and empirical studies, that a pwBPD might very plausibly be a person in a bad situation. 

I don't distrust everything psychology poses, but I do disagree with quite a bit of it. I would even assert that the way we understand BPD and the treatments we use can be quite damaging. 

An example of this would be indoctrinating into an idea that someone has a ""disorder"". That there is something inherently wrong with the brain of an individual. To get proper treatment, the subject has to trust that an expert is telling them the truth. 

I, for example, was told that I was faking suicidal ideation for attention by a psychologist. Putting my trust in them, I believed them. I started thinking, ""Well. Perhaps they're right. I *haven't* successfully completed suicide yet. So I must have subconsciously been faking it to keep people around.""

This is statistical lie and misunderstanding that stems from those guesses that psychology makes. Upon realizing that I was truly suicidal, that even my psycologist didn't understand that and would be unable to help, I was driven to extreme isolation and a severe and dangerous attempt. Truly it is a miracle I am here.

I am quite stable. As I age and mature, it gets easier. I have learned how to give love in a way that I get it. And ultimately DBT and the other treatments available are ways to cope with the pain that comes from not being loved. 

I think that a true cure exists. It just takes remarkable resolve and most importantly, it takes support from others.

A plain and simple guess, from a male point of view, on your statement ""I've never understood why men are expected to be more stoic or aggressive""; I was brought up to understand that it was my job to protect the women in my life.

Showing emotion was met with anger and reprisal. Stoic out of fear. Aggressive when we fail and more aggressive when we figure out aggression is more powerful than stoicism, especially when we have the strength to prove it. Which I do not have. Which leaves me with freeze or flight and I can't run for shit.

The women in my life, including my 3 daughters and a lifetime of being essentially the only male in the family group, growing up. I've noticed that they were raised to be in touch with their feelings. It was okay to cry, laugh, get angry... the last one is the one that hurts me the most.

BPD is the most emotionally painful experience a person can have- when the pituitary gland keeps you in fight or flight for weeks, months, sometimes years at a time. There is no illusion behind the absence of that. Your brain is either panicking or it isn't. When I have a stable home environment, my brain doesn't torture me. Plain and simple. 

I was explaining how when I have a semblence of the normalcy of my neurotypical peers, all of my symptoms disapate to the point where I am more neurotypical and stable an individual than they are. 
DBT, self help, therapy, etc hasn't had a fraction of a similar effect. A family that loved me did. I also am taken aback that you'd assert that needing a family is the same as having an inability to be alone or a sign that something is pathologically wrong with me. 

Lastly, take a neurotypical person and remove them from their entire family. Take all of the relationships in their life away. Upon meeting a new relationship, do you truly think that neurotypical person would act in a neurotypical way now? I don't.

**Shari Schreiber, MA,** ***who is not a legally practicing clinician*** **or in supervision or licensed**, is a big agitator of BPD-hate and most likely BPD herself, judging by the absolute hatred and hyperbole she uses to describe pwBPD. Unfortunately, this charlatan has not done enough of her own work to realize she's most likely using projective identification to make others feel her own self-hate.

A.J. Mahari writes very deep and insightful articles on BPD, but she isn't an ""ex-BPD"" as she says. Following her on Quora, you can see she is very black-and-white, all-or-nothing, and has hard and fast rules like ""BPD people can never have healthy relationships"" and ""BPD people can never be therapists, they will hurt their clients"". Another example of the phenomenon of BPD, that despite recovery, you *can relapse* and the BPD-thinking and impulses will still be there, and you have to *manage them* so they don't externalize and destabilize your life or others. 

Susan Heitler is a clinician who largely works on relationships. She's famous for going at it with John Gottman and advocating against any form of argument and being anti-conflict in relationships, whereas Gottman believes that conflict and argument are inevitable, it's *how the couple manages and navigates it* that determines a healthy relationship. She's had a history of trashing BPD like the others, until a psychiatrist with BPD called her out on her PsychologyToday articles and she felt so put in her place that she published her e-mail in an effort to save face and apologize.

,darkclamchowder,,,[],,,,text,t2_2zxgyjiq,False,,"This is a good observation. One of the new DSM criteria has to do with inability to tolerate being alone. In my personal observation I have noticed people with borderline traits tend to be pack animals and often have a compulsion to be around humans or animals they can cathect to. Your symptoms likely abated because there was a semblance of illusory object continuity.

However, one of the core problems in borderline pathology is the lack of object constancy. In laymen's terms, this means knowing the other still exists when they are not around. So, you see cases of people becoming emotionally crushed when their other leaves for a business trip, unable to do anything and falling into panic attacks or depression, or conversely, may repress the emotions and turmoil and act out instead by ""forgetting"" their emotional ties and having affairs, then returning to their relationship as if nothing happened once the object reappears. There are many degrees of and manifestations of borderline pathology and the DSM criteria can be seen and shown in many ways, so no borderline pathology is like the other. Every individual is unique and their etiology is unique, though holistically you can draw comparisons and see some resemblance. The lack of object constancy, a developmental milestone in early childhood, is one of the resemblances you see across cases.

My own mother was very symptomatic until she remarried, I was often the target of her emotional abuse and splitting. Now that she has all her emotional needs met by my stepfather, she's literally a different person. Still freaks out when I don't respond to her text for a day, still thinks I literally died, still gets upset at my fiance (she's a bad texter), but nowhere near what she used to be. As a teen I'd come home from bullying and get the silent treatment from her for a week straight for something I had no idea I did that she totally misperceived. If I didn't give her negative attention by fighting back, she'd abandon me with the silent treatment, or prod me until I blew up in a rage. In this and many ways borderline pathology is passed on from generation to generation- you have the genetic component of sensitive temperament, and then the ""best parenting they know"" of the symptomatic borderline mother, which subjects unconsciously the same abuse she was subjected to in a process of projective identification onto her child, whos pain and fear gives her the external validation she needs of the pain that her own mother caused her. And eventually, the child develops borderline pathology.

When I say it's not lifelong, I don't mean it can be cured. I mean it can be managed to the point where what is going on inside, the chatter of BPD brain, is muted and doesn't manifest behaviorally. It's an arduous but possible journey of:

A) Corrective emotional experiences- where you learn through positive relationships with therapists, mentors, very patient friends and stable lovers- that not all people will abandon you, but that boundaries are important. One important thing I learned was to remember all the good times in my relationship when my fiance isn't feeling good. Just because she's in a bad mood and isn't emotionally available now, doesn't mean she's never going to get better and meet my needs. This is the healing and creation of object constancy. Another way is to internalize memories of important people who have come and gone. That's harder, and I still have difficulty with splitting people who have gone on bad terms, and often have to remind myself that while our chapter wasn't meant to be, they had good qualities and I did enjoy them.

B) Challenging core beliefs. Can be done via CBT, REBT, and philosophical study. The idea is to identify your negative talks and assumptions, dig deeper to find the prevailing attitude and see how this points to a core belief- assumed in childhood- of something like ""I'm unloveable, I'm unworthy, I'm incompetent"". Once you find that core belief, it's like grabbing hold of a root. You pull it out of the dirt and all the roots start emerging from under the topsoil. Then you see how it informs everything down to your patterns in relationships and how you interpret the daily news, even down to how one may get mental blocks and underperform on mathematics problems. 

C) Uncovering the object relations. This is making the unconscious conscious and is a painful process. Oftentimes when you think you've found the unconscious and are making a decision in spite of your usual interpersonal dynamics, you're wrong. There's an even deeper layer that your denial is preventing you from seeing because your ego integrity is likely going to suffer from making that realization. The key to this is baby steps, people often don't achieve unearthing all of their unconscious patterns, even in psychoanalysis, but it's worth a try and self-knowledge is guaranteed to make your life more functional. Just don't start psychoanalyzing others. The key is to understand what your main defense mechanisms are, look at your interactions, and be brutally honest with yourself- as painful as it is- about when you're projecting, in denial, or rationalizing, splitting, or engaging in the most difficult to decipher primitive defense- projective identification. It helps to have a therapist that knows ego psychology that can call you out on defenses. Keeping yourself accountable by examining your own defenses is important, but I only suggest doing the psychodynamic work in this step once you've done DBT and gotten to a stable place in life as it is a painful, destabilizing process.

D) Hope and diligence. Keep hoping for better days. We with BPD have seen the worst and it can only get better from here. Life is not supposed to be easy. We are supposed to learn from our suffering and endure, become stronger, and ultimately, wiser. BPD can be a gift, as it's a struggle that is very hard to overcome, and thus comes with a load of painful lessons that will stick, and will make you wise beyond your years. Hope is there and it is the most important thing. But with it comes diligence, and putting in the work. Maybe DBT didn't work because emotion-mind had you hopeless and you didn't take it seriously. That's fine. Get back in the ring and go at it when you're ready. It does work if you take it seriously and advocate for yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;

In sum, the temporary relief you get from having connections should not be mistaken for relief from BPD. That'll only make you manipulate others to keep them around you so you can be stable, and this is the behavior that makes people dislike us. The true way is to *be patient* and *be diligent* in your recovery. Take anything you can get- Emotions Anonymous, DBT, Alcoholics Anonymous, CBT, REBT, self-help books, philosophy. Any support, if applied with humility, can get you in the right path toward recovery.

As a bloke I mean there is things such as the locker room talk which can be uncomfortable for some men. Myself, I don't even like telling people the name of the girl I'm talking, never mind kiss and telling haha! But just going back to what I said about the 1to1 basis, I'm absolutely fucking useless speaking to girls on the approach, once I get to know them I'm a bit of a casanova! (humble brag) I'm trying to word this without coming across as narcissistic but because we have (well I know I have) a very wild imagination... having sex is easier than talking to a girl for me for example because I'm passionate etc. I don't actually have self esteem issues in that department plus the idealisation/love bombing type phase adds to the excitement of it all for both of the participants usually (this may also be in his case - not necessarily but remember this is anecdotal). 

The pessimistic side of me reminds me that happiness for a man like me with bpd is merely temporary. I start to smother and get needy and inadvertently push them away. You're in a catch 22 and I'm sure he is aware of this in himself so is it worth the risk, the rollercoaster, the war?

You will not get the side of him that his partner will get from him.

&amp;#x200B;

I have the blank eyed stare which is embarrassing after you get the girl and she notifies you about it lel! But the hardest thing for me to do is talk to a girl, I'm introverted but I'd like all the pictures, statuses and stuff but I'd keep my distance due to what they have (the 2 in OP's post) and out of respect for her. Self-esteem might be a big issue, maybe he thinks he's not worthy of said person or the rejection side of it. He definitely sounds like he internalises all his issues and could possibly be explosive  if the emotion overwhelms him (at least that is how it is with me). Another factor might be paranoid rumination (which if she learned about could possibly make her reject him). I find that I start most of my relationships through a 1to1 basis so if he hasn't got her number to speak to her on text or on facebook messenger etc. You could maybe try to spare him on to maybe send just a friendly message to kickstart things. He may fear about coming across as too forward; if the person (girl in the example) knows his personality and has known him for sometime this is made slightly easier on him. Explaining your illness to a girl you've just met recently is often difficult for them to understand and they might not want to deal with that.  


A massive complication that we men can have is if we have a history of unstable or intense relationships, we deter ourselves from the approach even more not just because of the fear of rejection, anxiety etc, but due to our own self critique e.g. will anyone be able to love me? am i good enough? can i try to hide my illness? (yes maybe for a little time but ""true colours"" will come out).

&amp;#x200B;

Facebook and Instagram are breeding grounds for idealisation (in a healthy way and unhealthy) you can idealise a woman without having to worry because she/he lives in a different country and you're never going to meet this person or see them bla bla. I must fall in love with a new girl every day if I intentionally search for photoshop buffed women to follow! (to an extreme sometimes liking every pic after i followed them that they post)

&amp;#x200B;

Just be careful with the ""watches everything she does"" because if he does have the paranoia symptom like I do; then rumination can also become near pathlogical jealousy... trying to find out what she is doing, basically searching for an argument or will make something out of nothing to then argue. I'm sure you know what we can be like when it comes to arguing... bullets for words. Her liking a photo of a lad they both know may be perceived as she's going to abandon him and things can escalate from there when it could be an innocent like.

&amp;#x200B;

Just tell him to be honest about his situation, it doesn't have to all come out at once and to ease into things. You wouldn't put someone afraid of elevators in a elevator straight away, you would take a step closer each day till they're ready to enter. He has to take control though! (even when going in the elevator is really hard) 

And take control of his illness!

There the staff tried to take off the meds I've been taking for over two years for PTSD symptoms, prescribed over a dozen new brand name drugs (I have a list), attempted to switch my insurance provider away from the one who is paying for my existing care in VT to NY Medicaid which would cover their ridiculous detainment practices; the staff allowed unstable patients to freely roam and threaten other inpatients (""faggot,"" physical threats), neglected to clean up blood and shit that lay about in shared ward spaces for hours, didn't let us go outside but for one hour a day on an third-floor concrete patio surrounded by 20' of wire fence, and numerous other offenses which gradually exposed and retraumatized my history of professional mismedication and emotional abuse.

I was discharged after a week because I was denied NY Medicaid, which this hospital seems to have a financial incentive to drain, by overprescribing brand name drugs while systemically putting their patients through chemical abuse and exposing them to physical harm and retraumatization. I saw numerous patients who were entirely stable and ready for discharge who had been held for weeks, their discharge date delayed many times while they lived in prison-like conditions, at the profit of drug companies and to the detriment of patients' mental health.

They are not viewing the other person as an actual individual, but more like the way an alcoholic views alcohol. 

Especially when someone expresses they don't want a relationship, it takes very low self-esteem and disconnect from reality to continue pursuing that. Similar to an alcoholic, that person has to acknowledge and accept that they are the common denominator. Until that point, there is very little hope for change.

There is also some element of the disorder intentionally choosing emotionally unavailable people who will be guaranteed to ""abandon"" them, so the disorder can continue to reinforce itself. (""See?

It was at that point that doctors took me more seriously and referred me to a CMHT for assessment. 

However, I was referred to them in April last year. I was told I would be assigned a psychiatrist and a CPN. I am still waiting on a psychiatrist and whilst my CPN is a lovely woman, she has cancelled my last three appointments. So I haven’t even seen her since November. Which, as I’m sure you can imagine, has not went very well and I’m currently doing terribly.

,frukthjalte,,,,,,,,t2_tknt7,,,"Kind of, I guess... I mean, putting aside the fact that I'm usually depressed(and hence emotionally numb), I *know* that I *have* been happy before, and I can recognise when I once in a while get struck with a jolt of happiness. I also know what someone who is happy acts like and how happiness is expressed. So I can absolutely recognise *when it happens*.

However, as you wrote yourself: I have a *shitty* memory, at least when it comes to emotions. And even more so in terms of *positive* feelings. I can remember that I've been *acting* happy at a certain occasion, say, when I first started dating my now ex-boyfriend. 

But I can't for the life of me *recreate* or ""re-feel"" that happiness when I think about times when I've seemed to be happy. Which means that when people ask me about the last time I felt happy... It becomes blurry. Because I can't recall if I actually *felt* happy in those moments that I can remember. The feeling can't resurface in me, which makes me feel disconnected and even like that moment maybe never happened to begin with. 
So it usually ends with me saying something like ""Well, I was deeply in love with my ex when we started dating and I guess I was happy then.... Maybe?""

Don't quote me on this, but I *think* this is the same mechanism that makes it hard for us to understand facial expressions(a finding that seems to be supported by scientists). I mean, we *totally* take in a facial expression and probably even *overthink* them, but usually we make the wrong conclusions about what feeling is being expressed.

,oeu4,,,,,,,,t2_12ia3w,,,"The trouble with this is people with BPD often perceive persecution or wrongdoing from others, when it is not actually happening. Many times the person is merely reacting to abusive or weird behavior from the person with BPD. So revenge is actually punishing someone for something bad they didn't even do, so you can avoid facing your own shame. Easier to vilify others than turn our attention inward. 

This is the problem with victim mentality. It sees everyone as the savior or perpetrator, no in between. It ends up seeing perpetrators in innocent people (for not being the fantasized savior), so it feels justified in punishing them, ironically **becoming** the perpetrator -- all the while perceiving itself as the victim. This is the scariest type of perpetrator.

My friend used to date guys who said they only wanted to hook up, no relationship. So she'd mirror them and say that's what she wants too, even though she wants a relationship. So they'd keep hooking up, she'd say ""I love you"", they'd get uncomfortable and fade out. Then she would freak out, accusing them of being heartless sociopaths who used and abused her, telling me she wants to punch them and scream at them. 

Those guys didn't actually do anything wrong though. They were up front with her, and she **chose** to ignore that, thinking she could earn love through sex. It's not fair to see these men as perpetrators when she made the choice to pursue that. But the alternative is to face shame, and the Cluster-B disorders are largely based around avoiding the sensation of shame. 

It wasn't just relationships either. With jobs, bosses would go from ""best ever"" to ""evil abusive slave driver"", when really this was just a boss pointing out her constant tardiness, or meltdowns in front of customers. Or previously wonderful friends becoming cold and distant (""Right after I gave them a gift!!! What kind of jerk ignores a gift!""), while neglecting to address the behavior that may lead people to start backing away.

BPD is usually not angry at someone for something they actually did (although BPD is very good at **convincing** you that this is the reason for your discomfort). But BPD is *truly* angry because something that person did (or didn't do) triggered intolerable feelings of shame. Instead of experiencing the shame, BPD makes up a victim story where an evil abuser caused this situation to happen.",1515688384,,dsix2vg,False,t3_7plhmf,,,t3_7plhmf,/r/BPD/comments/7plhmf/is_anyone_else_a_vengeful_bitch/dsix2vg/,1517789696,14,,,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,,,,,1477950877.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,44803.0,,public,,1515696320.0,,,,,,

Tonight I've been under the same emotion that someone may feel when they have a mob hit out on them. Why? Because the woman I'm dating hasn't sent back a message in about four hours. So each minute ticks by, and I fight myself and my worst urges. Why? I'm idle and bored. But BPD says I'm fine, it's her. 

But we all know it's not her.

Feelings of being unworthy. Feelings like I'll never find anyone who gets me. Install Hinge. Get two minutes into going through profiles, but delete the account and leave it installed. 

Because you know, It's been FOUR FUCKING HOURS. So naturally it makes sense to do all of this after four hours. I mean, she should be sending me messages about how she misses me, wants me bad, feels bad that she ""doesn't give me the attention I deserve""... UNPROVOKED mind you. Yeah, she should be doing that. Now. Because it's not like she hasn't been doing it all damn week. 

This is what we go through. We have minds that calculate. But they don't stop calculating. They just run and run and run. We take in sensory information and just analyze the living crap out of it. So it stands to reason that in order to get some kind of balance going, we have to give that analytical mind an outlet.

That's why I'm here. That's why you wrote what you wrote. You need to talk this out with people who can understand that perspective. At least that's what I'm attempting now. Frankly, I'm as sick of my bullshit as you are of yours. 

So anyway, trust for me lies in people with objectivity. And that means seeking out new perspectives. My advice is to try to not let yourself rely to much on one person. Diversify your emotional support. Multi-source it. Do it responsibly, as you know you can. You will lose focus on the anxiety, and in turn, your triggers are less sensitive. Or you don't have the focus enough to have it trigger you in the first place.

First things first. I'm sorry your struggling luv. Finding a work/life balance is hard for everyone, and for people like us, it can feel impossible. 
The anxiety, panic, and shame you feel about your symptoms can come on strong and linger for days... itll weigh you down before you ever even make it out the door, if you make it out the door. I know just how awful that can be. When I was younger I really struggled with holding a job down, especially if it wasnt one I was totally into. 

That said, I will offer one piece of advice. Dont tell people at work about your mental health. Unfortunately, bosses are not mental health experts, and often lack the compassion and understanding needed to support you. If your job has an employee assistance program (those are usually confidential), where people with at least some type of training can get you in touch with resources then by all means, use that for whatever help you need or think you can get. . . But divulging emotional and mood instability to bosses, or even coworkers who you think are also friends, often leads to judgement, gossip, and usually from people who just dont know what BPD is, or dont care to know. They can call your judgment into question. They can pass you over for important projects or promotions out of fear or even just uncertainty in how you will react. 

It's totally not fair, but it happens often enough that those of us who wear or heart on our sleeve should proceed with caution. Alot of people out there, will see it as an excuse, or worse. 

Also, it sounds like some of the symptoms you are having are not well managed right now. If you are throwing up all the time, you should talk to a doctor and or therapist to make a plan tailored to you and your life on how to face these issues and find what tools are available to you. Maybe you need medication or a change in meds. Maybe you need to start your mornings with a routine, like a short walk to settle your mind, or some morning yoga to get you into the right head space so you can face your day. Your anxiety sounds rough as all get out right now, so having judgement or reprisals from work may not be something your ready to take on atm. Also talking to a doctor can rule out medical reasons beyond just the bpd. 

I have learned that the most valuable part of surviving the work place is knowing who you can trust with your emotions and mental health. Not everyone will listen and learn. And those people will sometimes unintentionally nd sometimes on purpose make things worse. 

""Some people get their kicks from stomping on a dream"". And if your new back to the work place, you may not even know who those people are yet. 

Anywhoo, please dont take this to mean you shouldn't talk to people about what's going on with you. Absolutely the opposite is true. Just be careful, and choose who you trust with care. You deserve a shot at success in the work place as much as anyone else. Especially as you are just returning to the workplace. Which by the way, IS A HUGE STEP. 🤗🤗🤗🤗 and something to be proud of. Dont let these temporary set backs limit your future possibilities. And don't assume that a boss, supervisor, or coworker will have anything positive to add to your efforts. 

Good luck on your journey luv. It will get easier the longer you go. I've been at my job almost 6 years now. . . That's longer then almost all of my relationships 🤣.

For me, looking back at my childhood, I think at least some of the ideas were first expressed to me from my dad, who claimed to be very intellectual, all for equality, feminism, etc. but would also say denigrating things about women alllll the time - I remember him saying he didn’t like Liz Phair because she was “dirty” and “harsh,” I also remember he would comment about certain women having been “rode hard and put away wet.” He hated makeup but also hated when women would cut their hair short. Stuff like that. I was just thinking the other day about his (not so) veiled sexism and how it might have affected me. (I was an only child raised mostly by him, he had full custody). 

So anyway, I attribute some of it to that, low self-esteem, and also the fact that it’s just somehow easier/the default for me to be negative when I’d like to be gracious and accepting and not scared of being inferior, for real.

I'm looking for the opposite. A way to unwind and treat the ""burnout"" of constantly helping. 
For the understanding of non-bpd people who want to take care of others without having to sacrifice their own feelings, put aside their own needs for the sake to comfort BPD all the time, basically avoid walking on eggshells and taking care of their own mental state and not overdo themselves in the process of helping. 
BPD are emotional sensitive and can feel something is up. That tends to backfire too, because we know you might be tired or stressed or even frustrated that your help isn't good enough, so our first thought is ""it's my fault, I'm doing this"". Most partners or family and friends forget that sometimes they can do ""more damage"" if they aren't ok themselves or treating their emotional needs right. I'm looking for sources that cover that part.

If they do, then you could begin talking about other symptoms that you've been dealing with or how you feel like these symptoms describe what you'vebeen going through. If they don't, then breach the subject a little and say something like, ""I've heard of some people that have a disorder called Borderline Personality Disorder, and they have some of these symptoms I've been dealing with, do you think this could be something I have?""

Some doctors will think you're just looking for meds or trying to diagnosing yourself, and disregard what you said, which is really sad but is a thing that can happen with BPD since it is a disorder that effects a minority of people.

But remember it will take more than one session to diagnose you and rule out overlapping disorders with similar symptoms, so just stay strong and don't let anyone push you around or dismiss your feelings! I know stuff like this can be really scary when you first jump into it, don't get discouraged if the first psychiatrist you tell doesn't immediately make the connection or tries to say you can't have it, and always seek a second opinion if possible if you feel the one you're with currently isn't taking you seriously enough.

My cat always helps me when I am feeling an episode coming on. I pet her and love her and she loves me back and makes me know I am loved unconditionally. 

I also like to draw. You don’t have to be good at it. But it helps put how you are feeling down on paper. Similarly to that, try and write down your feelings. If you are in an argument with someone or feel like your feelings won’t be heard, write it down and hand it to the person. By doing this you can reread and rewrite what you want to say so you know you are saying the right thing. 

Not sure if you believe in medical marijuana, but sometimes when I feel an episode coming I smoke a bowl and it helps me calm back down and think a bit more logically. I know it doesn’t make sense but it works for me.

That relationship is my first encounter with a pwBPD. In the course of our 4 year friendship, he has hurt me often, and I have been pushed aside, invalidated, etc. , but not discarded. Right now, I believe I may be in the process of being discarded, and it is killing me.  I am extremely fortunate to have a very large network of close friends, and that network is extremely emotionally intimate. What I want in my relationship with my friend with BPD, is that same intimacy and closeness, and for him to know how much I love and support him. I would love nothing more than for him to talk to me more openly about his mental health issues and to be given the opportunity to step-up and help him.

With all of that as background, I would offer this advice:

Go to your friends and tell them you're sorry. That's a scary and vulnerable thing to do, but that's where intimacy comes from.

Tell them why you discarded them and what that means if they don't understand. If you haven't shared you mental health concerns with them, I encourage you to do so. If I were them, I would want to understand what happened and why, and I would want to be given the opportunity to be understanding and supportive of my friend who is struggling.

As I said, I do not have BPD, but I have done an extensive amount of research. My guess (and my apologies if I am wrong) is that the shame comes from believing ""I'm a shit person who discarded my friends."" You have a legitimate mental health issue that may have caused you to act in a way that your friends would not. That does NOT make you a bad person or a bad friend. 

If you really care about the friends you've discarded and believe they care about you, be honest and help them to understand why you discarded them and what discarding is in this context, and instead of just asking for forgiveness for doing it, help them understand and bring them in - make them partners - give them the opportunity to be active participants in managing the issues that arise as a result of your BPD.

If I were them, I would be so happy to understand what happened and to be given the opportunity to work with you to make things better for both of us. 

I hope that is helpful. Good Luck. Follow-up questions welcome.",1577406028,{},fc43zdf,False,t3_eg2oys,False,True,t3_eg2oys,/r/BPD/comments/eg2oys/how_do_you_guys_fix_broken_friendships_with/fc43zdf/,1577406029,1,True,[],False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,

The first few days were absolute hell and it was a struggle to get through the day sober and every moment felt unbearable. I felt heartbroken and it felt like I’d been dumped even though that wasn’t the case, he continued to love me. I also had that desire to get back at him or make him insecure like he made me insecure, or to have fun without him and prove it to him, since he’s having fun without me. I took it as, “if you can have so much fun without me then you don’t even need me. You should just stay there forever.”.... unfortunately I literally said this to him. And then I started bashing him for even saying he wanted to go to japan with me, I was like “no I’ll go with my friend instead cuz you can’t actually go with me”. That made him really sad because he genuinely does want to go with me one day but I was completely rejecting that idea out of spite. I was just being such a bitch. I was upset because he wasn’t obsessing over me like I was over him, and I took that as a sign that he doesn’t love me as much. He wasn’t laying awake anxious af every night waiting for a text like I was. 

Honestly now I can’t really even remember how I felt because I don’t feel it anymore. I was honestly going about my life thinking/planning ways to do things that would make him see how much fun I’m having here without him and hoping it’d make him insecure or miss me more or something (I don’t even know) but that has changed. Honestly that desire to hurt him was motivating me to act on things. I don’t know how or why, but I guess after I felt included at a Fourth of July party and he actually did express missing me more frequently, I began to not only say, “baby please don’t be too sad, I want you to try to be in the moment and enjoy your trip while you can” and MEAN it thoroughly. I meant it before, of course, but then I’d feel hurt if he did have fun. I’m not sure if now I’m just appreciating a little distance or I miss him a lot less or what, but I do not really feel jealous at all, nor do I feel heartbroken. There was even a day where I wasn’t sure if I loved him because of how ok I felt about the situation. I really do want him to be happy there and I even wouldn’t mind it if we didn’t talk as much.

Not everyone's experience is like this but I'd say that many people who used to be Christians and have struggled in their faith or fell away and experienced a lot of pain because they knew religion, not God, and no, it's not their faults.

You're not good enough because of what you've done or what you believe in, you're good enough simply because God said so. You can't make yourself any better or any less in His eyes. You don't have to believe in Him to be loved or worthy, your disbelief doesn't change the reality.

Jesus is God in the flesh. Right now, Jesus is in heaven and resides in a spiritual realm apart from the physical realm we're in right now. People are able to hear and communicate with Him. It isn't possible to have a relationship with someone you can't communicate with him. He speaks in a multitude of ways, it can be audibly, it can be through dreams, creation, visions, pictures, other people, the bible, our thoughts. I would say though that the depth and frequency in which God speaks to those He has a relationship with and those who don't believe in Him differ. He is always speaking, but not everyone recognizes His voice. God does know you, very well. He knew you before the foundations of the world. He knit you together in your mother's womb. He knows the number of hairs on your head. He knows when you sit and when you rise and your thoughts from afar. He is omniscient. He has always known you, but we have not always known Him. The love that God has for us is called agape love and it's one of the most profound, mysterious things and it can be hard to comprehend but ""while God can never be exhaustively understood, he can be known truly, personally, and sufficiently."" &lt;-- I can send you a link that sums this up very well.

Not your fault, I was a bit heavy handed. I have a very dark and deadpan sense of humour.

&gt;Mine definitely was diagnosed as I heard it from other people including her ex husband. The only reason he even offered to talk to me was because I was so good to their kids. She never mentioned it to me. Not once. I didn't even get the common courtesy as a human being to be told about something so serious but yet I was held to the standard of not being a mind reader and everything used against me. I was brought to nothing in the matter of two weeks. Going from talking about the future to getting kicked to the curb was very painful. Probably always will be.

That's horrible. I used to be very manipulative like that as a child, before I really knew something was wrong and started obsessing over my thoughts and actions. I ended up developing empathy by the time I was like 16 but by then I already burned Self awareness is key for people with BPD.

&gt;The 7 years thing: I am a short man. That is stigmatized as much as anything on Earth. I am 34. I have felt and experienced so much pain in that regard it is hard to understand. From being bullied as a kid, to being told I couldn't do anything because I am too little, to being dismissed by 85% of the female population because I am not above 5'10"", the pain inside me has been lifelong. Therapy helps, support helps, but it doesn't change the fact that I have to try harder to be seen (that is kinda funny actually. A little pun haha) and that effects me everyday.

Yeah, I feel that pain too although it's more acute at your age. while I am 6'4"" I was also closeted and uncaring about my appearance, looked like a bag of shit draped in black and I went through high school and most of college with the belief that I would always be alone romantically. When I said ""anyone who doesn't have mental illness"" it would've been more accurate to say ""anyone who hasn't gone through some shit"", which at my age (21) is most people. People are much less stuck up about shit like height as they get older though so it can only get better from here.

&gt;This was a misunderstanding and I apologize. However, keep in mind it is impossible to get a feel for what someone says via a bunch of words. Best wishes

Thanks, will do. I never really thought about the non-BPD people who come here until now so thanks for that.

And the same thing when you're feeling happy, it's much easier to recall other situations when you've felt that way.  That's why someones when one feels bad, it feels like life has *always* been bad. Or good, or boring, or whatever that emotion is.  Maybe this is obvious to most people, but for me it was an interesting insight and a reminder to fact check my thoughts and emotions regularly, even the good ones.  When I have an intense emotion, I try to think of 2 or 3 recent instances where I'm had other emotions, as a reminder that feelings are temporary and that is okay.  From there, I find it much easier to use whatever skill the moment calls for (I'm not sure if you do DBT or not, but a lot of the skills are very simple and easy to find online!).

Part of the healing process for BPD is discovering you have it, then identifying parts of your behavior, past and present, that are non consistent with what you understand to be the ""Norm"".

Sometimes we need a sounding board. Sometimes its hard to open up to someone and say you engage in some ugly behaviors... But that is what we often need in order to make adjustments to ourselves, and to better the lives of those we choose to love.

Mine definitely was diagnosed as I heard it from other people including her ex husband.  The only reason he even offered to talk to me was because I was so good to their kids.  She never mentioned it to me.  Not once.  I didn't even get the common courtesy as a human being to be told about something so serious but yet I was held to the standard of not being a mind reader and everything used against me.  I was brought to nothing in the matter of two weeks.  Going from talking about the future to getting kicked to the curb was very painful.  Probably always will be.

&amp;#x200B;

I have read 3 books, started a support group for people who have suffered from BPD exes, and attend therapy.  Rest assured, I walk the walk.

&amp;#x200B;

The 7 years thing:  I am a short man.  That is stigmatized as much as anything on Earth.  I am 34.  I have felt and experienced so much pain in that regard it is hard to understand.  From being bullied as a kid, to being told I couldn't do anything because I am too little, to being dismissed by 85% of the female population because I am not above 5'10"", the pain inside me has been lifelong.  Therapy helps, support helps, but it doesn't change the fact that I have to try harder to be seen (that is kinda funny actually.  A little pun haha) and that effects me everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

I only mention that because, as a stigmatized individual myself, I like to be there for others like me (stigmatized) because I know we all need support.

The biggest problem was probably that we weren't compatible off the bad, he wasn't responsible and preferred being alone, which into my irrational fears. I would have insecurities and try to communicate it to him, but he preferred leaving it unaddressed and we never worked through anything so the insecurities kept growing. 

He wouldn't reply to my messages for HOURS, even days if he felt like it, with no other excuse than ""I didnt feel like it"" and I was too scared of him leaving me to call him out on his BS. I just let all bad behaviours slide.

Looking back I really never should have put up with that sort of behaviour.

A lot of it was my fault though, I'll admit. I was crazy, irrational with my feelings and needed constant reassurance. If I didn't get it from him, I'd talk to a friend who would give me the validation I needed. This led to me being more emotionally dependent on other people, and people thought I was cheating on him which I wasnt, but emotionally? Maybe, not sure.

The events leading up to the break up made me crazy though. I was constantly freakign out and insecure. He cancelled on me four times in a row (with decent reasons I suppose) and I blew up and it was fucked by that point.

Anyways glad its over now. I really missed it but now I dont feel much except for contempt towards him.

,cybelda,,,[],,,,text,t2_z6n1h,,,"Honestly, I can't say if this is good advice or not because I've only remembered how to cope within the last week. I go through these bouts of forgetfulness when I'm having a really intense ""episode,"" and I COMPLETELY forget all my coping strategies and things I use to pull myself out of it. But, that being said, personally, it helps to just let the emotions just... exist, I guess? Without feeling guilty or trying to fight against the anger/hurt when it arises. Not to imply that you *should* react to it outwardly, but to let the feeling of hurt actually hurt. To not think ""I shouldn't be feeling this"" and let that feed into every negative thought. I understand how problematic that sounds, but to do it in a way without diminishing all sense of accountability (in the case of you exploding/directing your anger AT someone) really, really helps.. for me at least.

The easiest way I've been able to make sense of it is like there are two internal identities: one is a disgruntled child, and the other is an adult trying to rationalize with the child. It makes it easier to calm yourself down and level out if you're patient with yourself in trying to explain why you're feeling what you're feeling. Why are you so upset? Why are you so excited? Basically, talk to yourself like you'd talk to an upset kid. You wouldn't (ideally) get angry at them/yell at them/etc for reacting the way they do when they're overwhelmed, so don't get angry at yourself. It only makes it worse. And yes, I'm aware that this strategy in and of itself is an example of black and white thinking. It's kind of ironic, honestly. 

I'm worried this doesn't sound coherent or like it relates to the question at hand, and I apologize if it doesn't; but I'll include a specific example. I know that one of my triggers is when I'm with my close friend and I hear a notification from his phone. I don't outwardly react until I'm alone, but I immediately feel hurt and panic. Like by him checking his phone to talk to someone that isn't me, I'm being pushed aside. ""He's bored with me,"" ""She's more interesting,"" ""Why would he lie about wanting me here?"" ""He's lying, he's lying, he's lying."" It gets exponentially worse and eventually spirals into complete disdain until I'm splitting and convinced that my skewed interpretation of the situation is what's *actually* happening. It's a twisted sense of abandonment, basically. I know how I'm going to feel about it later, so instead of pushing it off and internalizing it in the moment, I let it hurt. I let the thoughts of abandonment in all the while knowing they're untrue, but without invalidating them or belittling myself for thinking what I'm thinking or feeling the way I feel. Typically, it's the thoughts that make your heartbeat speed up that you need to be the most patient to yourself with; the ones that you push away out of habit because you know you're going to react irrationally to them. It is the only way I've been able to stay calm and not explode into a mess of panic, tears, and anger.

Realistically, I know how this sounds. I know that it's hard to try and be objective in the midst of it all. Trust me, I understand. But, if you can pull it off, it will help a hell of a lot more than just trying to pretend like the emotions aren't there or feeling ashamed because they are. It's helped me to not react so intensely and uncontrollably. To not react against myself for not being able to see the grey area. I really hope this makes sense and doesn't sound condescending or as if I'm trying to minimize how real everything feels in a moment of internal crisis. Only trying to share what's given me some sense of security and control during it.",1537486456,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e6cjsz6,False,t3_9hfbgh,,True,t3_9hfbgh,/r/BPD/comments/9hfbgh/how_do_you_guys_manage_your_explosive_reactions/e6cjsz6/,1539348166,5,True,,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,,,,,1467449002.0,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1.0,36212.0,r/BPD,public,,1537547927.0,,,,,,
,Greyhunted,,,[],,,,text,t2_8c15t,,,"&gt; I lack A LOT of empathy. I've always been told this by ex partners.

Do you really think so, because I was kind of wondering about this but I did not share this conclusion. People with BPD (from my own viewpoint; as a non-BPD person) do not have any less (or more) empathy than the average person.

The problem however, lies with the fact that people with borderline tend to experience their own emotions way more intense than the average person, which in turn affects your empathic capabilities. The emotions basically temporarily suppress your basic empathic capabilities.

See it like this: If you are swimming in a lake you can think clearly about all kind of things. For example you can think about were you want to go and how long you want to stay (because your friends/parents will otherwise worry about you).

However if you suddenly find yourself in a whirlpool, your thinking will obviously be way more limited (this is a completely natural reaction). At that point the only thing you will (logically) be able to think about is your own survival. Other things, like the needs of others, will at that point be removed from your mind, until you are out of that whirlpool again.

Please keep in mind that while you are not a child, you are still young and your brain is still physically developing. Neurological development does not stop until around the ages of 21-23. So not only are you experiencing heightened emotions due to hormonal flooding, but you still have yet to finish developing your own cognitive skills.

I applaud your self-awareness. Use this time to develop as strong emotional coping skills as you can if you fear you may be predisposed to developing BPD.

I feel exactly the same, I always feel as if I make my symptoms up when really until they suggested it at 16, I thought my reactions were rational. Now I just go completely the other way, hyper aware of what I'm doing, but also unable to change it. 
I'm From the UK, so our help is really limited too, but admittedly I have backed out of so much therapy I'm surprised they would even consider helping me anymore. I know it seems really hopeless, sometimes I get so lost in that feeling, but the most important thing is to work on yourself first before any relationship. Me and my partner have fully established that I manically rushed into this relationship, almost convinced it would fail, however I've been so so lucky to be with someone who tries to understand so much. But the ideal scenario would be to receive the help first and learn to be in a healthy relationship afterwards. Although I try not to project, the Bpd really does make it difficult to maintain a relationship healthily, especially and mostly in my head!
I wish I could say something to help it get better, but first working on how you view yourself can be helpful. It sucks that you can't receive good help, it's the same here and I feel constantly consumed with shame that I haven't taken the opportunities I've had. But that's part of this bullshit disorder I guess, all you can do is keep trying to get an understanding of what makes you tick and how to manage it. Personal relationships will come after. But don't think it's the end because you're not in that place right now, these things just take time.
Thank you again for reaching out. If you ever want to talk then feel free to PM me too, I'm rubbish at personally reaching out but i am always down for hearing a rant or helping out anyway I can.

I try not to rely to heavily on my ""feelings"" as I know that they can't always be trusted. I try to rely more on objective facts of the relationship.

Mainly, if I ask for something is he willing to give it to me, within reason? Yes.

Does he make an effort to communicate with me when he goes out of town (he's out of the country for 3 weeks and I've ridden the ""we're breaking up"" rollercoaster all by myself during that time)? Yes.

Does he verbalize and show his affection? Yes.

Does he cause harm to me? No.

Has he given me any evidence to believe he is untrustworthy? No.

My feelings, I am learning, are not facts - so I try to stick to the facts of the relationship more so than rely on how I feel.

[],leafthatshithomie,,,[],,,,text,t2_2q9zgi2k,False,[],"Most of my previous jobs ended in me snapping and mentally breaking down. I struggle to stay sane working full time and sometimes I find myself hoping I'd be hit by a bus or become seriously ill just to not have to work. I know it's not the job itself because as far as they go I love it, my colleagues are pretty nice, managers are cool, pay is decent for the field. When I have my happy moments I am *oh so happy*. 

It's working in general that I hate. And I get most people dislike work to some degree. But it just feels so emotionally draining and I'll get home and have no energy to do anything other than lay there and waste my time on my phone. I'm most content when I'm sleeping or just snuggled in bed in general, doing nothing at all. I fantasize about being in bed all day at work. I'd much rather spend the weekend laying around than doing anything. I hate to be such a lazy, boring person to others. But that is what I like. 

All I can advise is take each day at a time, each hour at a time and each minute at a time. Deal with things as they come. Obviously I don't mean procrastinate and leave things until the last minute but take a breath, break things down and cut life into bitesize pieces. Take each day as it comes. It's the only way I can manage, at least.

Also, make time to recharge. You may not think you 'have' the time, but you'll waste a whole lot more time letting yourself burn out. Something I've started doing is having a cup of tea and sitting down as soon as I come in. I'd always come home, put my things away and start dealing with chores etc immediately after working a full shift. I've learnt now that it isn't the end of the world if I don't hang up my bag straightaway. It's okay to drop it on the floor, chuck my coat over the door for a minute and just stick the kettle on.

I've worked really hard on controlling it and now that I'm in my 30's I've gotten much better (but still have issues).

Like someone noted, a large part of it is how I perceive the world ""should"" be.  Despite having BPD, I am super conscious of other people and try to be as unobtrusive and considerate as possible.  I would NEVER sit in front of someone at the movies when there are other seats available, so how DARE someone else?  It's evident that they're selfish, entitled, and obviously the hugest asshole on earth.  They obviously have no regard for other people and it's people like them that make the world a horrible place.  It's taken me a long time to realize that (most) people do things that piss me off because they're oblivious, not malicious.  Of course, it doesn't stop me from silently fuming to myself that if people took 5 seconds of their day to be less oblivious the world would be a better place.

I still have issues with my husband at times.  He makes a sandwich and doesn't clean the crumbs off the counter?  He's a worthless human being who obviously doesn't care if he leaves messes for ME to clean up.  It's totally black or white thinking and I manage to fight the urge to explode 98% of the time.

,MentallyIllAndChill,,,[],,,,text,t2_caz4x,,,"Express. Breathe. Redirect. 

Rinse and repeat as needed. 

Express what you're thinking and feeling, but in a private manner, just for you. Something that can be disposed of, if necessary. Do something that allows you to just blow off the steam, the energy, the feelings, the thoughts... Everything. 

Breathe, and comb through the thoughts and feelings, and dig into the ""why"" of it all. What the driving force is, and ultimately, what is the desired end result. Ultimately... Look forward 5 years into the future and ask yourself ""Will this matter 5 years from now? Will I still be hung up like this, 5 years from now?"" Look 5 years to the past, and think, and recognize how far you've come from the things that seemed like the absolute end of the world. 

Redirect. Now that you've allowed yourself to process, recognize that you're allowed, and it is healthy to, *let it go.* This is the hardest of the steps. It takes a while to start, but you can do it. When the feelings you can't cope with dredge up, redirect the energy to something you enjoy, something you love. 

As I've said, rinse and repeat as needed.  Sometimes, you can go through the process once, and come out the other side, cool as a cucumber. Sometimes, it takes 5, 10, 20 times through.

,sulfurxskies,,,[],,,,text,t2_17kdbbfw,,,"Definitely! I graduated high school in the USA in 2014, though my final year was largely spent away from my school as I was enrolled in a special program at the local adolescent psychiatry facility. That ended up not working out, so my parents pulled me out, but I had already finished all the credits required for me to graduate so I spent January-May working 30 hours a week at my job. 

Went to university for the first time in Autumn 2014. Withdrew due to my third hospitalisation because I wasn’t able to catch up. They wouldn’t let me re-enrol in the spring, so I went home and attended the local community college and had regular medication management. Failed that semester. Then I went back out to the university I attended in the Autumn for Autumn 2015 because they were pleased with my efforts with the medication. I managed to pass, but I was on a “probation” of sorts and was only allowed to stay if I actively sought out treatment and showed progress. Though I did my best, my therapist I worked with through the university was not pleased and did not give me a positive reference. Unfortunately, this meant that I wasn’t allowed to re-enrol YET AGAIN, so, for the second time, I went back to the community college. I was able to finish my Associate’s Degree (2-year degree) in Spring 2016 there. I had another slip up in Fall 2016 and had to withdraw from the community college, but went back in the Spring of 2017 and did okay. 

At this point, I decided a change in environment could help and I accepted an offer of a place at a university in the UK for Autumn 2017 as my boyfriend of two years lives there and the university was ten times better than any near me. Unfortunately, this didn’t quite go to plan and I only passed 2/8 of my modules this past year. I don’t consider it a complete loss though; I discovered that I’m likely suffering from BPD instead of anxiety and depression, and I discovered a newfound interest in a topic I had never studied before. I’ve decided to start again on a new course and stay at the UK university. 

If this works out and I don’t have any more slip-ups, it will have taken me 7 years and about $160,000 in student loans to get my bachelor’s degree, and I will graduate in June 2021.

,MrsR35,,,[],,,,text,t2_ytjbqle,,,"Goodness grief, that's bs that he would say you need it. I compare myself a lot too tbh, but me it's every single girl I see--from television to ads to in person. I just compare and compare and I always lose in one way or another. It's absolute chaos for me. Makes me not wanna leave my room sometimes. I really also think it was extremely wrong and disrespectful for him to bring up his exs in those manners. If a guy did that to me, it would be burned into my mind as yet another wound. You could use someone who respects and understands you--well, try their best to understand and help you. I thought it was hopeless for me but right when I was about to give up there he was. The only way he has ever hurt me is by saying something I take wrong.

I am so sorry that you're going through this. I was in situations before a few years back where the guy would actually COMPARE me to his exs and to other girls--like tell me my hair isn't a certain color like theirs and it should be, or that my breasts aren't big enough etc. I think that's actually where I formed this whole comparing thing. For the record, if he is telling you there will always be someone better than you, thats really not right. That's just wrong. No matter what way, that's so wrong- and with our extra struggles and how our mind latches to words like these, goodness. I bet you're beautiful... We just don't want to believe it because we think we're not good enough. You may have made him happiest, but it's not right for him to say these things and cause you harm. You deserve someone who thinks you are perfect to them, even the flaws are perfect. It sounds strange, but it's real. You aren't crazy, you're just hurt. You have a wound and it takes time to heal. That's not right for him to use that against you in a way when he's angered. You do not deserve to feel like you'll be abandoned because of what he told you. You deserve someone who won't say those things, and who will reassure you that they won't abandon you.

When my SO first saw my BPD show, he was very confused at first, but he had this feeling there was something more to the picture he was seeing. He stayed patient and kind to me, and even talked with family members to try to figure it out. As he found out about the things I have, he began to actually read about it to further understand. Even with all this though, I was so scared that he'd leave me because of my triggered moments. I was convinced it would happen honestly, and I would just be waiting for that day. But months passed, and he was so sure that I was the one for him. I won't lie, even now how were married and how close we are, sometimes I feel like he will leave me because he will realize he shouldn't put up with the bpd bs I have. But honestly, he tries so hard to help me heal. He has been through an absolute beating, I never meant to put him through it, but here he is not holding any of it against me. Just recently, these past few days actually, I began to realize he won't leave me... And he does love me, and his words are real. I feel my walls coming down, finally. I will also say one thing that has helped tremendously is how we do lean on religion as well, but I won't dig into that on here nor push it on anyone. Truthfully, even talking to him just now about this, he loves me even at my worst, and has also showed me that these wounds also caused good things--like how compassionate and caring I am, and how honest I am, and how I stick by his side no matter what. I will say that there has been heated times where he thought about leaving, but he never has, and never will. Sometimes it just gets hard and hectic. But he never gives up on me. 

You and I both want the same thing, and we both deserve it as well as everyone else on here struggling with their wounds. I believe you are getting better, and the reason why is because you're on here talking to people about what you're going through and how you feel. That's taking a huge step. Also recognizing that you do have bpd, and that you do get triggered, is yet another big step. You seem like you are more aware of yourself than you even realize. I am glad you are also recognizing positive traits about yourself, which again is another major step. You got this, don't give up. There's hope, even when you don't think there is. Lastly, you're never alone. You made me tear up too haha. :) Thank YOU for helping me too. Cheers to our strengths as we carry on, though our battle may be tough, we won't give in to defeat. Cheers.

I kept freaking out and asking my boyfriend where I was going to stay when we went back to uni, and  how I would afford to replace my things. He kept telling me that it was just a dream, but I couldn’t believe him. This went on for at least a day or two, then we went back to uni and I determined that I had dreamt it all when I was staring at the building directly in front of me. 

Unfortunately, I can’t say that I have any advice, but I hope it helps to know that you’re not alone in this!

My GP also says there’s not much he can do for me since he doesn’t want to give me any other medications, aside from referring me to the CMHT.

,MemeMaiden,,,[],,,,text,,,,"Thanks, memes are a way of life lol. I think for any relationship with someone who has a disorder, the partner has to learn about it to work with it. My recent bf told me that I was obsessed with comparing myself to his past gf's he talked about and asked me why I needed to be triggered.... Yeah, like people ""need"" things that torture them and like they want to be constantly reminded of them. This never would have been the case if he didn't fondly bring them up, especially when it came to sex. We could have had a good relationship if it weren't for that (all the emotional lows came directly from him talking about his past).

It's not that I forget that the good between us happened so much as I push them to the back and focus on how he wronged and hurt me when I'm angry, and from there it turned into me tearing myself down because he made his past gfs seem so great. He told me that no one is perfect and there will always be someone better than me in some sense, so I think maybe they were prettier than me, had better bodies, sexier than me and were good in bed because they were confident and moved fast. Me? He's my first for everything. I'm inexperienced, my body isn't that great, and I don't know if I'm just slightly above average or if I'm actually attractive. And on top of that they all, except for one, seemed stable compared to me. Somehow i'm supposed to believe that I'm the best? I'm the best match? Maybe they were better than me in those areas but I'm the best for him and make him happier than they did, but it hurts to have someone still think and talk about past partners like that even if it was sporadically and briefly -- that's still no excuse and it's still hurtful. Recently whenever I brought up how he fucked up by talking about his past, he just told me that we're done, I need to fuck off, and get help. He knows about my BPD so for him to say we're done knowing I have abandonment issues and it will shut me up is shitty of him. Even if he is just saying it out of anger it made me regret ever telling him anything because instead of having him try to understand me it's like he's using this knowledge of my BPD against me to keep me in line. 

I don't doubt that he loves me but I question how I make him happy even with my BPD. Do you ever think that they want to stay because of the person we are when the BPD moods aren't present so it's like they have this hope that eventually there won't be this dichotomy of BPD and non-BPD moods and we'll just be the normal, lovely person they fell for and not the monster they eventually saw? I guess it's different for you since you're married to your SO, but did you ever wonder about that? 

We haven't spoken to each other for almost a week and maybe this is the end. He never wanted to leave me despite my erratic emotions and how abusive I could  be sometimes, but maybe he's had enough of me always getting triggered by his past and bringing up how much he hurt me by making comments about it. I'm not sure if I've made any improvements or if it's pessimism or realism telling me I'm getting worse, but I do want to make changes for the better regardless of whether or not he's in my life because I want to grow and be better for myself. I just want to be whole and not broken. I want to be happy and finally find peace within myself. Lately I've been losing hope in finding that and then also  fearing that I'd do more damage if I stay in a relationship and eventually have kids because I'd hurt them with my BPD rage by being emotionally/verbally abusive. It was all enough to make me want to resign myself to a life of solitude, but I'm getting out of the self-sabotage and remembering the good qualities I have that make me a good person that deserves happiness. Just by writing to you and having you tell me that I helped you made me tear up a little, tbh, because it shows that there's still some light in me and I'm not completely lost. I'm not giving up on myself and I'll definitely check those books out. Thank you so much for helping me, too.

i had 2 grams of shrooms and i crushed it into some oj with my friend who had 3.5g. at first nothing really happened except for feeling giggly, then manic, then my room seemed really strange and was flowing. for the first bit though i was having fun, i was also doing whippits throughout the entire trip but i wasnt smoking.

at one point i sat down on my bean bag and curled into a ball and shit got real weird. i felt hot and sweaty and i couldnt breathe and i was crying but i didnt realize it till my friend asked if i was okay. i dont remember what I saw but i was thinking about my family (aka the root of mt PTSD and bpd) and i felt so scared and sad and like i was being forced into something, this eventually went away but came back even worse later.

towards the end of the trip, my friend interrupted me sobbing bc he thought itd be better to get me into bed so we could go to sleep. it took me a while to figure out how to get in my bed and under my covers, once i did i started crying again and i had vivid flashbacks of being in my first home and hearing my family. i got up and went outside and he came with me and i started screaming crying to a point where i didnt even notice i was doing it. i could hear myself and my face felt wet but i didnt know why i was crying and i couldnt make it stop. he sang to me until i calmed down and we went back inside. after all of this, he and i sat on my bed and smoked joints until the effects had worn off almost completely

basically, make sure youre 100% ready and positive and excited for this experience. theres always a chance of a bad trip so make sure you start off with a low dose and youre with someone who has more experience so they can watch over you. i personally wanted to have a trip like this bc i want to learn more about myself and my trauma. a lot of ppl dont want that tho so if you just wanna have a fun trippy time then just make sure youre in a good place mentally when you try any psychedelics.",1530228588,,e1gwbyt,False,t3_8uobm1,,True,t3_8uobm1,/r/BPD/comments/8uobm1/can_you_share_some_personal_stories_about_your/e1gwbyt/,1533042513,2,True,,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,,,,,1529399217.0,True,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,1094.0,,public,,,,False,,,,markdown

&gt;**We are proposing the etiological hypothesis that BPD frequently results from the interaction of two factors (Gunderson &amp; Zanarini, 1989), one of them biogenetic, the giftedness; and the other a disturbed parental involvement factor, severe, chronic verbal/psychological abuse by caretakers during infancy and childhood.** The psychological abuse may differ in many ways from child to child, but it always includes chronic resistance to or assault on the healthy development of a child's perceptions and sense of an autonomous self. This abuse is so threatening and damaging that any intuitive talents become almost totally directed to pathological patterns of relating that are the basis for the characteristic, perhaps pathognomonic (Zanarini, Gunderson, Frankenburg, &amp; Chauncey, 1990) interpersonal powers of these patients. Attachment theory (Bowlby, 1988) can explain the clinical manifestations of BPD as resulting from the interaction of these two factors, without assuming other biogenetic factors such as inborn abnormal personality traits or defects   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; **Chronic, pervasive verbal/psychological abuse had occurred in 100\% of the BPD sample.** Psychological abuse subcategory findings were : 30&amp;#37; (7/23) chronic neglect; 70&amp;#37; (16/23) constant devaluation; 83&amp;#37; (19/23) intrusion/invasion; 74&amp;#37; (17/23) chronic attack on autonomy; and 74&amp;#37; (17/ 23) chronic attack on, depreciation of, or total nonrecognition of the child's special access to feelings and intuitive insights. At least 2 forms of verbal/ psychological abuse had occurred chronically in the lives of all 23 BPD patients, with 3 or more occurring in 17 cases. In comparison, 32&amp;#37; (12/38) of the control patients met the criteria for psychological abuse, a significant difference   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; **In summary, for our group of borderline patients, there was major biparental psychological failure, by combined commission and omission, throughout childhood and adolescence.** In addition to the categories of psychological abuse already described, there was in every case a chronic family atmosphere of morbid, disturbing dramas between parents, and/or between one or both parents and the child, usually involving strong negative affects   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Our findings about patterns of parenting behaviors are in line with a preliminary report from Zanarini and Gunderson (1987), who found evidence for chronic verbal abuse by female caretakers, along with inconsistency and physical neglect by male caretakers. Similarly, Soloff and Millward (1983), in a controlled study of 45 BPD inpatients, found a significant pattern of intrusive, controlling, overinvolved mothers, along with underinvolved or absent fathers and a confllctual marital relationship.

Pros:
   I used to go in all the time to study and bum their wifi and escape home, so that building has always had a special place for me.  
   I am an extrovert, and I really have a hunger for human interaction.  But when my emotions are going crazy I usually don't have the confidence to approach people unless there are clearly defined roles.  I ask customers what they want, then I make it.  
   There isn't a whole lot of opportunity for overthinking. 
  Working as a barista often pushes me outside of my comfort zone. When I want to stay in bed, I go make people coffee instead.  
   Our customer base is fairly varied, we have people who come in daily, weekly, occasionally and people there for the first time.  I love the consistency and familiarity that the dailies give, and I'm excited when I'm able to explain the shop to people who haven't ever come in before.
   We are a fairly tight knit group.  There is a girl who quite around the time I was hired a year and a half ago and everyone is excited to see her when she comes in because she's one of us.  Even those of us who never worked with her. I'm excited to think that I'm a part of that and that maybe I will always have a place there? 

Other benefits: free coffee (seriously, on a bad day nothing beats a cinnamon cappuccino), free brownies, I get to bake all the time and don't have to eat everything (but if I want to, I can lol).

Cons: 
   I'm triggered by loud noises sometimes and the bathroom has a super loud vent and so when I need to have an anxiety break it isn't quite ideal.  One of the coffee grinders bothers me sometimes but the other isn't a problem? 
   Gossip amongst my coworkers can be a problem sometimes.
   I'm pretty empathetic, and we work in pretty close courters, so if one of my coworkers gets stressed I got more stressed.
   Sometimes customers order something and don't know what they ordered and they get mad.  
   Sometimes customers are rude, but usually most of our people are good.
   Sometimes I'll be working and one of my friends will come in, say hi and eat or do whatever they came to do, then they'll leave without saying goodbye.  Actually most people do that.  It hurts and feels like abandonment, but sometimes they told me they tried to get my attention but I was working and didn't notice them and I'm conflicted when I feel this way.

I agree with the sentiment a lot of people have expressed that affection, or the idea of affection, seems more precious than life itself—that living without it is like living without air. It's felt that way every day, day after day, for the last...oh I don't know, 2000 days in a row. Every single one of those days, I woke up wondering if I would meet someone new, someone special who liked me back.

So let me say, just being by yourself apparently does not suffice. It hurts as much or more now as it did last year, and the year before...

A few years ago--I was drinking nearly a bottle of vodka every other day or so along with cutting, getting high, and abusing prescription pills. I was also like hooking up with gross older guys like...nearly my dad's age. It was like...there was this frozen, barren void inside of me and I had to do something to ignite a fire to keep myself warm. Similarly, I still feel as empty as I did then--even though, objectively, my life is probably in a far better place.

I like that reminder: thoughts are not facts. I struggle with that a lot. Once I start to /feel/ sad...it all goes downhill: I feel like I'll never be happy again and everything is awful. Something that has helped since making this post is sorta finding small things to lift my mood.

,hackziggins,,,[],,,,text,t2_x9r54,,,"Hey, first sorry about the slow reply. I skimmed over this when I first woke up this morning and meant to get back, just remembered.

And yeah I've been pleasantly surprised how reddit has a pretty nice mental health community. I used to look for forums for different things back before reddit was a big place to go for this sort of thing and it was always... idk hard to get into. Here you can ask, just read and consider, sometimes open up... it sincerely kind of feels like group therapy, some of the good parts of that, with a bit more anonymity, a little more freedom to come and go.

Of course by no means am I saying reddit mental health subs should be sole source of treatment, but your situation sounds practically similar to mine in that for different reasons we're kind of ""on the fence"". Like me I was diagnosed in 2010, and it's a long story to get into but more or less I don't consider that a hard, sure diagnosis. Again it's complicated. And treatment disappeared for me for a long time afterwards, I never thought about it again until recently, with recent events in my life. But yeah I went back and looked at BPD more in-depth and realized it fit a lot of what goes on with me. And, like you, I wouldn't say I'm someone who suffers from the full intensity of it as I see some do. But yes, there are certain instances where I identify strongly with what others are talking about, and it feels good for me to try to add something positive or relatable if it seems appropriate. I'm sure any reddit mental health sub would be a nightmare for some schools of thought within psychiatric treatment lol, but it really is better than having no clue, no-one to talk to, walking into free clinics with nothing but what you've read from articles and wikipedia... again, it's like an informal group therapy, and as I understand from your words, it's similar for me in that occasionally I can read something that nails it so well that it really helps me. I'm super happy to have been able to help you in that regard. It's almost like an instant pay-it-forward situation because literally a day or two ago I got the same kind of gratification from another's words on this sub.

I feel weird offering you advice, giving more than empathy, your description of your life is much more high functioning than mine is at this point. But I would remind yourself this is a very serious disorder, and chronic feelings of emptiness are a real part of it, one of the symptoms. The thing is, you are not broken and something being wrong does not mean something is fundamentally wrong with you. It is absolutely incredible and so great you have stopped self harming. But consider the fact of cutting. When you were doing so acknowledging this disorder was easier, perhaps. But since stopping the fact that your outer life is great and now you do not engage in this extreme behavior, so thinking you must not have BPD crops up, unintentionally. But internally it is all still there, and it is big stuff. Therapy is the thing that will really help. 

You have managed to internalize all of it and perform in life, that shows incredible strength. But you deserve healing and recovery as well.  Because it is the same stuff as people like myself who have lived far less functional, far more intense and chaotic lives, and it only gets better with therapy. You may not end up forced for survival as people who wrecked all their relationships, could never hold down a job, moved constantly, got into drugs and alcohol, and all the other chaos, but you really do deserve help as well. 

The seriousness of BPD is compared only to schizophrenia and DID. Therapy really can help, it hes helped me more in 1 year than I could do in 20 of adulthood by myself, real changes both practical and emotional. I am finishing highschool, I got a first part time job and it worked out well, I am going out and meeting normal people, I officially lost the GAD diagnosis, and the depression and suicidal thoughts are nearly gone, things keep improving. And you have the practical stuff sewn up, therapy really can help in terms of the emotional stuff. You are struggling with real stuff, and deserve help a great deal.

From an outside perspective (although obviously it always feels different from the outside) I would suggest that you have gone from devaluing to idealising and now he has cut you out it’s triggering previous traumas and abandonment things (I’m sure you already know this anyway but sometimes it doesn’t hurt to remind yourself) So your mind makes you think he was ‘the one’, but I don’t think he was.

One day she unblocked me. At that time I was in a bad relationship that shortly after would end badly. I reached out to her and it was awkward at first. When the bad relationship fell through, she was there to help. 

We never really spoke about our time together, but I was deeply in love with her. And I still am, in a different way. It was hard losing her but in the end we ended up closer than ever.

I'm not a doctor, but I believe it is just a mood stabiliser. So it can be used for a range of disorders. There are a range of drugs that can be used that cross over with other disorders, so it is just a case of finding what works for you. 

The drug prevents my moods from being too extreme. I still have ups and downs but they are not as extreme. 

My therapist and I came up with the analogy of being stuck in mud when I am in a prolonged low mood. Before the treatment (both DBT and drugs) I was drowning in the mud and couldn't go anywhere. Now, I still end up in the mud, but I'm able to walk in it and not let the rest of my life crumble when it hits. 

However, I'm now also on Lexapro which is another mood stabiliser but was prescribed that to assist with over-sleeping. 

If the doctor is a general GP, I wouldn't take his comments too much to heart. If it were me, I would give it a shot. Worst case scenario, you have bad side effects and then go off it.

I couldn't even talk to him for a year after we broke up because it hurt so much. I was a disaster. I loved him so much and my life was horrible without him. We saw each other and hooked up a couple of times in that time, and I remember coming home one Sunday morning and curling into a ball in the shower and crying for hours, wishing I could wash every part of me he had touched off of my skin, feeling so mad at myself and so lost in the ""how can he not let me love him the way I do?"" type way.

,50xy,,,,,,,,t2_10b2blpb,,,"My best advice is small goals, and keyword being small. I have a hard time sticking with routines too (coincidentally I also struggle with binge shopping and binge eating and have a toxic mother). I make super easy, doable goals for myself, like doing 10 minutes of cleaning a day. Cleaning the house on the weekend would be nice, but it's overwhelming and I can skip it for months. I did a fruitless ""cleaning day/just kidding"" for most of my adult life. So I tell myself, just do a few minutes of this thing or that thing today, and it works. And I often end up doing more once I get started. 

Same with exercise. I always want to exercise a significant amount, but that discourages me. So I have a goal of 20 minutes of any kind of exercise I want every day, light or hard. I basically give myself permission to burn a measly 50 calories or whatever, as long as it gets done. I usually end up going over 20 min and doing multiple exercises, like cardio + weights or cardio + some yoga. If I made a goal to do an hour of exercise, I can guarantee I would skip it every day. But I tell myself only 20 mins, and I often end up doing an hour. And if I only do 20 min, then that's OK because that was my goal anyhow. But it gets me exercising every day. 

Reading - I dream of being well-read, but you can probably guess how that goes. So I made a small goal of always having an enjoyable book to read, whether it's a few pages a week or a few chapters a day. If I don't like the book, I have permission to quit reading and find another, even if I only read the first 2 pages. And it doesn't have to be a good or thinky book. It can be utter trash, as long as it gets me reading. Guess what, it works. When I used to have goals of reading a book a week, reading intellectual books, etc, I never read! It was too overwhelming. 

One last example: I struggle with brushing and flossing before bed even though I know I should. It seems like such an overwhelming endeavor. So I always tell myself, 5 minutes. It's 5 minutes out of my day. I won't even do it thoroughly, I'll just do it to get it done, the dentist can take care of the rest, lol. Well, when I get started I end up doing it AND I do a good job because the damn brush is already in my mouth, so I might as well. But I know myself, and if I think about exerting time and effort into doing a good job cleaning my teeth, I'll just skip it. So I always say: only 5 minutes. Small goals help get the job done. 

It's funny, but last night as I was trying to fall asleep, I was thinking about the phrase ""mental exhaustion"" myself and how it would make a good song title or something. idk why things come so easy to some people and are so daunting for others, like you and I. It's unfair... but it is what it is and you have to make the best of it.

From examining my own story, kids learn by exploring the world around them, get scared and run back to their parents.  Ideally the parent will comfort them and send them back out, showing what to look out for and what is okay...Guess we didn't get that, or at least I didn't because I see most of the world as a dark place that is always trying to kill me.

I've worn two pairs of Doc Martens every day for the past four years and I love the fact that people comment that I'm the ""Docs girl"" or ""they know it's me when they hear my clunky boots"". Then I got a few piercings and saved up to have a specific arrangement of studs.

You might not have a job with a dress code. But maybe if you stuck to a simple pattern when it comes to the full outfit and then focus on focal points (shoes, jewelry arrangements, etc) it might take the pressure off.

i intend to see what my spouse has been up to lately as his  attention seems to have taken a sudden change on  his phone at night, when i mean night i mean late late nights. He kept deceiving me saying stuffs like it was his BFF that needs more of his attention lately because He just been divorced and heartbroken and we always have to respect our privacy even when we are best of friends i never knew those answers until i contacted them here almondhackingarena . com it was breath taken when i saw all those evidence from the past deleted conversation and daily activities which they retrieved for me.. i cant say less than to be grateful and moved on faster than it would look like. I came to realize He wasn't in love with me all these years we’ve been together, its outrageous though but i believe we always deserve to know the truth and learn from our past i just want to use this medium to show appreciation to this talented soul helping lives and saving relationships out there

Both have impaired sense of identity in different ways, both are characterised by pervasive feelings of emptiness, both can be manipulative.  

From what I have read, the main difference is the mechanism that drives emptiness and how it's acted on. For people with ASPD, nothing serves higher order goals, there's just the present circumstance and if there's no short term stimulus, it feels like death.  

This leads to substance abuse, callous and predatory acts, outrageous deceits, reckless risk taking and pursuit of danger, since it's the only thing that makes life meaningful and otherwise, the moment is empty and life nihilistic. As a result, a disproportionate amount of people with ASPD end up with substance issues and in the prison system.

,sunflowerysunsets,,,,,,,,t2_1br6z18x,,,"You're very welcome! Feeling balanced as an individual is definitely my main struggle. I am finding that the more time I have to myself to build up my sense of self through hobbies and activities, the fewer self esteem issues in my relationship I face. Getting in to routines has been key for me: every morning, I write in a gratitude journal that includes some prompts and positive affirmations, then I try do yoga at least twice a week for myself. The more we can do to show ourselves some love, the less we need it from others.

Here are the gratitude journal prompts if you want to start the practice! I find that doing it sorts out what I can do in the day to take care of myself. Additionally, the positive affirmations are amazing at helping with self confidence. I first started the gratitude journal after a friend recommended it to me after a traumatic breakup. When I started doing it, I was just going through the motions, but every day it helped more and more.

In the morning write:
""I am grateful for"" followed by 3 things
""What would make today great? Followed by 3 activities or tasks (this can be anything. Sometimes I write something as simple as 'drink water')
""I am"" followed by at least 3 positive affirmations

At night write:
""Amazing things that happened today:"" followed by 3 things, no matter how small
""What would have made today better?"" At least one thing. Keep it compassionate and forgiving.

,hannahhlynn106,,,,,,,,t2_1cl1ncaq,,,"Yes, I have actually been twice. (I'm from the US). The first time, I went to the counseling center at my University and relayed that I had been having suicidal thoughts and had self harmed, they immediately called the University police and sent me to the nearest psych hospital. Luckily, it is a pretty nice one. I was sent voluntarily, so I did not have to go to court (it is an informal court session that people who are under a Temporary Detainment Order must attend in order to see if they should stay in the hospital or leave). Anyway, while I was there, we are encouraged to take part in group activities, like therapy sessions, art sessions, meditation sessions, etc. They are mostly helpful and give you something to do. Other than that, the days consist of breakfast, a morning goals group session, freetime, another session, lunch, freetime, another session, freetime, dinner, and then wrap up group. You also see a doctor everyday and if requested you can see a therapist. It is kinda a lot, but you don't have to go to every session (though it is encouraged). Although, most people in this hospital are there for drug abuse or they accidentally decided to kill themselves because they were influenced by drugs. I was not there for that, I needed mental help instead, which was mostly given, although this hospital was more or less a short term stay and they want to get you out asap (if you are ready of course). I was let go after 8 days and returned home with an outside therapist and psychiatrist. 
Now, the second time I went I actually had a suicide attempt and my friend had to call the police, as I was in my dorm room unable to call them myself. They came to my room and loaded me in an ambulance and took me to an emergency hospital. After that, I was taken to the same mental hospital as the first time, but this time I was considered TDO and taken by the police. Luckily, when I got there, my University made me voluntary again so I did not have to go to court. While I was there, same stuff happened, same schedule, etc. Saw the doctor everyday, they put me on new medications, and this time I stayed for 6 days. 
Alright so, that is my general experience. Here are some tips:

-voluntary is the best way to go in

-if you are feeling suicidal, a mental hospital really is the best place you can be

-try to find a short stay one, because you do not want to be stuck there for longer than you want (usually after some medication and therapy you should be ok to go back home and have an outside provider)

-make sure you have support out of the hospital like parents or family or friends, they can come and visit to make you feel better (and this also looks good for getting out)

-getting out can sometimes be tricky, so do communicate with your social worker and make clear that you are willing to get help and want it

-make friends with the people there, it helps you connect and communicate with people bc many have had the same experience or gone through many things and it can definitely help talking and having a relationship with others
-just make sure you cooperate, but also make clear that you are the one in charge, they cannot hold you there for longer than you want and if you feel you are ready to go then you can

-lastly, it can be a little scary, but I promise you that if you are needing the help, then it will be helpful to go

-make sure you do your research though and find a good and respectable hospital! There are many out there that can take advantage of their patients, or not provide the exact care you need.

,[deleted],,,,,,dark,,,,,"Yeah, this is what's so tough about BPD because it basically forces you to be what people see as the epitome of a bad person. Like you said people see borderlines as childish, temperamental, vindictive, unreasonable, etc. In fact, I knew a lot about mental health, but when I first met my FP, who has BPD, I had no idea he was hurting. He just appeared like an on-and-off asshole.

He'd ping pong back and forth between the sweetest guy you ever met and the meanest. But I was intrigued by this and decided to get to know him better and to also start researching possible causes of his behavior. Eventually I found BPD and then it all made sense. Intense fear of rejection or abandonment, going back and forth between idolization and intense disillusionment, inability to be alone, seeing attacks where there were none, guilt over his actions yet unable to break the cycle, etc. etc. etc. it's him!

So now that I know about BPD, if I meet another borderline, I might be able to notice it and thus show them proper compassion (rather than reacting to them based on thinking they're just a jerk) but the general public doesn't know this so borderlines have a really hard time not pissing everyone off.

We spend a lot of time worrying about the downsides our partners deal with (which is reasonable, I've been a nightmare to some of my exes), but don't lose sight of the fact that BPD also means you probably catch onto his moods super quick, and your upswings of joy are probably contagious. We're a challenge to deal with but if there was no positive nobody would bother. Believe that you are bringing a lot to the table, because you are. And from that place, not a place of self-blame, see if you two can work on learning how to talk about specific actions and feelings.

This leads to solving problems quicker and cleaner, and also helps me from harboring negative repetitive thoughts that would poison the rest of the day.

Don't try to find things to do that will define you. You are only partially defined by what *you choose to do*. It usually happens organically - don't try to force things just for the sake of having a hobby.

I remember whenever I’d try a new antidepressant/dosage I’d have a few weeks of experiencing what you’re mentioning.

I’d suggest staying on the meds as prescribed and see how things change over the next couple of weeks.  I think what you’re experiencing is totally normal and once the levels of medication even out in your bloodstream/you get used to taking it the irritability should start to ease up.  If in 6-8 weeks you’re still experiencing it, maybe ask your doctor to try a different medication. And make sure to tell them how it’s making you feel!

Maybe as a first step, research anonymous non-emergency help lines to call and have a chat, withoit the pressure of them knowing who you are or having to do ongoing therapy at this point ❤️",1548381507,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eew64c8,,t3_aji23j,,True,t1_eevxhrb,/r/BPD/comments/aji23j/i_lost_my_virginity_younger_than_i_should_have/eew64c8/,1548381508,1,True,,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What gives me the energy to keep going is shopping (not gonna lie). I love buying things that make me happy and looking good, even if it's only for a day or so. I love talking to people, giving advice, hearing and/learning about their journey. Making people feel good because when you're like this, like us, you know now it feels to just feel so bad.

I know one day I will meet someone who will be dedicated to me. In a healthy way. I know my ideal relationship may not be a healthy one. My expectationa are distorted due to BPD. I know I need therapy to change. I personally cant live like this much longer.

I encourage everyone to be present. Focus on the moment. When I feel myself begin to disassociate and go on auto-pilot and I begin to ruminate, I narrate my actions. It keeps me in the here-and-now.

I feel like most of the people who say things like ""I had an ex with BPD, that's why she's my ex"" and other things like that don't even know what BPD actually is. I really think they just looked up ""manipulative mental illnesses"", saw BPD, read the symptoms, and said ""this is it! That's what's wrong with them!"" and just ran with it. They never say whether or not that person was officially diagnosed, so they're probably just armchair psychologists who have no idea what they're talking about. 

Usually, the people that they're referring to have something else, like NPD or ASPD (I see this a lot on the family/friends of pwBPD subs). They may have BPD, but have it be comorbid with another cluster B disorder, bipolar, DID, or substance abuse disorder. They may have just BPD but the diagnosis doesn't make them immune to simply being an asshole. Or maybe they're just an asshole with no mental illness whatsoever. That's too complicated for these simple-minded people to understand. They'd rather have a little box that they could just place people into, and everyone else is ""normal"" to them. It's like the people who say that people with schizophrenia are all violent. Some are, but most are not. Multiple factors come into play here. 

Keep in mind that on those types of subreddits, the poster is only telling ONE side of the story. Of course they're going to gloss over things and ignore any wrong doing that they may have done, because they want to paint themselves as the victim and appeal to people emotionally. There's three sides to every story: his side, her side, and the truth, which is usually somewhere in the middle. I looked at the post that you're referencing and I find it kinda hard to believe that the guy in question had NO idea this woman was incredibly awful and that her personality changed overnight after 4 years of perfection. I find it hard to believe that he was the pinnacle of a perfect partner until the bitter end. In reality, he's probably just incredibly naive and inexperienced, meaning the warning signs just didn't register, and she was probably never that great to begin with. Tbh, it sounds like he may have some BPD tendencies himself with the way he idealized her and became so attached to her. It doesn't really matter, but don't let what others say bother you. The best we can do is try to educate them and live by example. If they wanna be ignorant, let them be.

,Ametaiyou,,,[],,,,text,t2_32qccwuu,False,,"I am what would be classified as a ""quiet borderline."" 

I would say I was stable for years after a meltdown and 2 day stay in a psyche ward. I abandoned high school my senior year for an older guy. Ran away to be with him. It failed. I crashed. Came back home. Decided I was a failure for not finishing school and embarrassed because my parents were right about what would happen. Then the guy cut me off and I felt like I wanted to die.

I've always been lucky enough to have a steady group of friends. I focused on that and decided romantic relationships weren't for me. I finished high school. I started online gaming (endless supply of people to meet  24/7) and committed myself to my college courses (I love learning). I was steady for years. I was ""strong,"" friends called me emotionless (which began to hurt after awhile but just to paint a picture of how stable I was outwardly). I found an outlet in online anonymity. I felt like I mastered my emotions and put them aside to be objective.

I self harmed pretty bad in HS during my freshman and sophomore year as well. It stopped when I got a boyfriend who also self harmed. We stopped together but after a year I got bored and wanted to be single. I lost weight through dieting and obsessive exercising. Got more attention from guys, I flirted with whoever I deemed worthy and went out with my friends on the weekend. I got a part time job so I could by the clothes I wanted. I finally got to he who I always wanted to be. This was me until the guy/relationship mentioned above.

I know now that if I focus on work, school or just friends in general I'm able to be okay. I still struggle with my self image. I can look in the mirror and cry at what I see. I am attractive but I have no always been and I feel like that was apart of why no one loved me as a child. I run into things at work like feeling attacked unfairly or thinking everyone hates me or that management wants to fire me and they're just waiting to let me fuck up enough so they can do it. But generally, I'm okay. I was called Queen of my company by a few of my co-workers. I work in IT. I've never been popular in my life but there I was, lol.

Then i had to leave that job due to circumstances out of my control. I couldn't afford to live outside my parents financial support. It forced my hand and it all came out. Everything. The childhood neglect. Feelings of being unprotected because I wasnt loved. The abuse my mother allowed. The anger I held for her. And all I kept hearing was how stable I was. That I was too smart to be suicidal. That I know how to be okay so it should be easy to snap out of it. I was going crazy. Wondering how many pills I needed to die. Or causing a car accident to die. I felt guilt and shame for leaving my job and letting everyone who had taken a chance on me down. I didnt want to do leave all the relationships I had built...

During all of this, this guy I had just started seeing told me I was doing this for attention and laughed at me. Said I had a nice job and nice house so what do I have to be upset about? That I was upset over nothing. That he had been through more and he was okay so I was being a drama queen. He told me I talked too much and my conversation skills sucked but then said he thought I was too good for him because hes not as successful (I now think he has BPD too for reasons this post isnt about). Before I left I asked him if he wanted to say goodbye. He didn't say anything so i assumed he was happy i was gone. Then he told me my self pity wasn't attractive and that i have too much baggage for him. He also gave me an STD and said he didnt have it (which is a lie because I was tested after my last sexual encounter  and I was healthy). I hadn't had sex in 2 years before him and after our night together it felt like my uterus was falling out, there was so much pain. I KNOW he lied.  Then told me he confessed that he lied to me about something but I couldn't tell when he lied. Which to that I said, I knew you were full of shit even if I dont say so.

I say all that to say, I am stable so long as I dont pursue romantic relationships. Online dating was a horrible experience for me outside my home state. The stock is just different where I'm from. Regardless I know the key to my stability is to just focus on being present in the moment and focus on career advancement. No relationships. Of course online gaming and spending time with friends. I go years between relationships. I date only out of bordem. If I keep myself occupied and happy with work and go back to school, I'll be okay.

For the past year or so things have been the best they ever have been for me and it was because I was financially able, had friends I talked to daily, had a satisfying work life, and found things that I enjoyed doing.

,nonbinarybit,,,[],,,,text,t2_1f28zag,False,,"&gt;How can I establish a self-identity when I don’t really feel...real unless someone else gives me value and meaning? How can I love something that isn’t there? I feel like my therapist is asking me to conjure up something that doesn’t exist.

This, exactly!

The very idea of identifying with a ""self"" feels wrong and even dysphoric to me. I would challenge the idea that a self is necessary, and if it exists it's ""not a thing but a process"". 

The way I approach it is that I think of ""myself"" as more of a system than a self. I can define ""myself"" by the external things that give me value and meaning, because the fact that I value these things is a statement of who ""I"" am. When I seek external validation from others it's because I'm using their perception of me to build a self-model, which is why ""who I am"" can seem to change so drastically depending on context. Because that *is* ""who I am"".

And what's wrong with that? For me, I feel like my lack of identity was more of a problem when my doctors thought it was a problem and I was mirroring their feelings. But I like being a dynamic system, selves are too suffocating! I'm defined externally, so what? I have some degree of control over the external world, so I'll shape that world and by doing so, shape ""myself"" within it. 

""Self-care"" looks different when you don't have a self, but it's not like the system can't take care of itself without an identity. I can justify caring about me because I care about others, and by treating myself well I'm in a better position to be of use to the people, ideals, etc. that I value. 

Self-love feels unnecessary to me because there's no self to love, but I try to respect the system-self even if it can be frustrating at times. Besides, what's there to hate? It just *is*. You don't get mad at lightning for starting a fire, you install lightning rods. Action, not judgement.

Having such a disjointed identity can be useful, even. If I'm experiencing an intense burst of negative self-talk (I hate you, you're horrible, you're worthless etc.) it feels absurd to counter it with positive self-talk...but this comes with the realization that the negative self-talk is equally absurd! Still more bizarre is that awareness of this absurdity makes the experience no less real! All the more reason not to attach a self to it, I think. Instead of treating negative self-talk as judgment of ""myself"", ""I"" step back and try to observe and understand what (who?) is happening. Then, the question goes from ""am I good/bad?"" to ""is the system working functionally?"" Not ""do I love myself?"" but ""am I meeting my goals?"". These are easier questions to deal with, and far more relevant. 

This is my perspective after a great deal of thought, research, and personal experience. For me, being told to develop a positive sense of self misses the point completely; the issues I have aren't issues a ""self"" will solve and the solutions I've found don't depend on a sense of self or identity. Who needs a self when you have a sufficiently complex system?

I'm a girl, and I can't imagine experiencing being like I am, whilst also having people tell me I'm not allowed to experience emotion. Like I just uncontrollably vomit emotion from every pore. Although it can contribute to people thinking my gender is 'overemotional' or 'hysterical', it's never hated as much as it can be when men show emotion. Fuck toxic masculinity. Men should be able to show vulnerability without being judged. And I encourage you to show it regardless (if you're able), because it can help other men (and women I'd say) to show that side of themselves too.

Also, just a side note (and from what you've said about it, it shows that you definitely have awareness so that's a massive step in the right direction.) - the phrase ""you should smile more"" and many variants of that, often come from a place of ""it's makes ME feel better when you smile"" rather than ""I want YOU to feel better"".

I have no obligation to look happy/pretty for anyones benefit, other than my own.

I feel like it'd be easier to get the attention that I crave if I was a girl. 

I don't relate to other guys at all. I don't really care to talk about the concrete things that they do. These feelings are what are clogging my mind, not that football play, that thing about your car or that video game scene. It's not me. I like discussing feelings or going off on goofy hypothetical tangents. I like being open about things that I feel, not hiding it just because ""nobody cares"". 

Unfortunately, I can never seem to get as close to women as I would like. I've never had a hint of a romantic relationship. I get concerned that they will be disgusted with how quickly that I want to get close and just leave. So I basically never make my intentions known due to fear.

I also don't even know how to get close without feeling like I'm intruding upon their privacy. I feel like unless I'm approached, then the only way of starting a connection that is safe is through teasing. Which doesn't always do much, and the opportunity rarely comes up. I get so scared of people abandoning me that I fail to start any relationships in the first place. I crave close female friends, but the idea of them leaving me is to harmful.

I had one female friend for about 10 months, and she ghosted me as soon as I moved away from her (She told me that my intensity and openness were causing her panic attacks and just blocked me before I could negotiate).

Worked with highly skilled psychologist for a full course of therapy, she was tremendous and did great work and took insightful notes. 
Great path for 2 yrs, but crashed and hospitalized. But, she is willing to see me in hospital and begin our journey again,  
Until the doctor decides no, screw all of that, I asked him four questions and he said yes to cannabis so we're replacing that with this heavy narcotics and thays his diagnoses. Cannabis use disorder.  
  
Discharged, with nobody planning any sort of release plan or goals with me. Back to work now on narcotics and I miss my appointment - the son of a bitch drops me as a patient with no contact. No family doc to get a script, and I found out I needed a new script after a confused back and forth with pharmacy while I ran out.  
  
I was so fucking sick for two weeks. I cursed that son of a bitch so much just locked in my house withdrawing.  
  
Awesome plot twist: they did studies and funding due to this bullshit care (the wonderful psychologist was part of this) and Dr dontcare got bumped down by a wonderfully educated and plan orientated psychiatrist.  
  
So I started seeing him and he changed my world upside down when he handed me a paper, at 29 yrs old and all these struggles and searches, an answer I had never heard of before. BPD.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't officially been diagnosed with BPD but I exhibit all of the signs as well as co-morbid diagnoses of Anxiety, Depression, CPTSD, OCD, and others. I have always had a hell of a time in relationships, all of them ending up disastrous or intense heartache that sends me into a shame spiral. 

&amp;#x200B;

My SO, who I have been with for a little over a year, is such a blessing. He grew up *so* normal: big, loving family, middle-class, played sports, etc. He is extremely supportive, and is there to calm me down after I have a really bad anxiety attack or just get furious for no reason at all. He is truly my best friend and I haven't ever felt that way about a man. However, because we love each other so much, I think that he wishfully doesn't see my mental illness. He tells me that this is a result of my childhood trauma and assures me it's not as bad as I think it is, but that alone can make me frustrated and feel so isolated at the same time. He doesn't get it, and that's okay, I wouldn't expect him to. But after years of dating men who were narcissists, it is so refreshing to be with someone who loves me as much as I love him. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are still the moments where I get really freaked out because of how good it actually is, and I don't feel like I deserve him a lot of the time, but I think that because he is mentally pretty healthy, it definitely helps me feel more grounded. All in all, I think it has to do with finding someone who you are compatible with and who is VERY patient and understanding. Mental illness is really hard to deal with on your own, let alone in a relationship with someone who doesn't quite get it, as much as they may want to.

,Maine_Coon90,,,[],,,,text,t2_3esjqgbh,False,,"Got the label slapped on me after one session with a psychiatrist at age 18. I'd been in psych care for self harm, suicide attempts and a rather nasty eating disorder for a long time before and diagnosed with depression quite early (OCD was suspected as well but I've mostly gotten over that). Apparently that team (doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists) were thinking BPD but did not diagnose teens with bipolar or personality disorders on principle. The psych who diagnosed me was independent from that team and I'm unsure how much his decision was influenced by my old records. 

I've had multiple psych evaluations from different doctors over the years following that and none have disagreed with the diagnosis (I did have one primary care physician tell me he thought I might have bipolar I rather than BPD, and I happened to agree with him, that's not a psychiatrist or an official diagnosis but it did influence some of my med changes so I thought I'd mention it). I've learned to manage symptoms far, far better now and don't actually see myself in most listed BPD traits at all, but as of last year my psychiatrist's opinion is that I've got BPD, Major Depression (severe and treatment resistant, naturally), CPTSD, and severe substance use disorder.

The only outright false diagnosis I ever had was one of my doctors as a teenager decided I had somatoform disorder NOS. Not sure if she really believed I was ""somatizing"" or outright bullshitting, either way her garbage diagnosis got thrown out when I got a new doctor who quickly clued in that I had uncontrolled diabetes and a couple of herniated disks. 

I've been referred to multiple therapy programs and one on one therapy but I've never actually completed any because I find it to be a huge waste of time. I learned to manage the worst of the symptoms on my own through experience, and if I'm being truthful, my psych medication (antidepressants and antipsychotics) deserves most of the credit for helping me do that. 

My BPD diagnosis didn't really affect my life at all, because after I was diagnosed I googled the symptoms and said ""yeah that doctor's full of shit"" then ignored it for 10+ years. It was only recently (after like the 4th? psychiatrist said, yep, BPD) I conceded there might be something to it and started making an effort to understand what BPD even is and came here to learn about various ways that BPD can manifest in people.

I still don't think I experience most of the symptoms and struggle to see where my psych is coming from.

This is a good way to do it. If you're interacting with a pwBPD what helps the best is **SET**: **S**upport **E**mpathy **T**ruth. This is because splitting can make a person with BPD come off as wanting their cake and eating it too (future wife vs project disaster).

Naturally it's really difficult to be supportive of a person you're about to break up with. It can be as simple as something as an ""I"" statement as basic as ""I care about you"".

Empathy should be pretty easy and straightforward for you. Just remember to avoid telling the person how they're feeling. It's incredibly hard for people with BPD to identify their emotions and they'll get incredibly defensive and angry even if you're correct. Instead, put their experience into words, mirror their body language etc.

Then finally the Truth. Just the facts, as it's up to the other person to use the truth the way they're inclined to do so. ""I can't be in this relationship; it's not healthy for _either_ of us."" for example. 

You may want to block as much contact as possible afterwards, there's likely nothing good coming from those messages. People with BPD tend to come from dysfunctional families that are _enmeshmed_ (lacking defined boundaries). Typically this means the person has learned that love means enmeshment and they don't fully understand boundaries. It can feel _really manipulative_ when they push boundaries in an attempt for both sides to surrender boundaries and get enmeshed once again; the person just doesn't know any better. Thus you need to be _very staunch_ in your boundaries.

Finally because he's already getting like this _two weeks_ in, I'm worried for you and want to offer some sage advice: Trust your gut if you feel like he may get physically violent. Of all the attempted predictions of whether a partner like this may get violent, the other partner's intuition has consistently been the best predictor.

,LetSleepingDogs,,,,,,,,,,,"I searched through the DSM-5 and the BPD is the only illness whose diagnostic criteria include the word ""emptiness"" at all. The word appears in the differential diagnosis section for several other disorders; in each case it's mentioned as something that sets BPD apart from the other disorder. The only other time the word is even used is in footnotes comparing depression to grief:  
  
&gt;In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that ingrief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in MDE it is persistentdepressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure.  
  
It's possible that similar feelings are referred to elsewhere with different words, but I didn't see anything similar mentioned in the differential diagnosis sections I read. It's also possible that what your brother describes as ""emptiness"" doesn't match the way it's used in the DSM-5. Nevertheless, ""chronic feelings of emptiness"" seem to be unique to BPD.

A lot of getting better with bpd is placed on you actively making choices to do things to help you get better. 30 minutes of exercise, eating healthy, good sleep routine, keeping yourself busy are all things that are the steps we take to get better for a lot of mental health disorders and they don't require you seeing a therapist or doctor to do and they aren't magic either they aren't gonna make you better right off the bat these things are maintenance that you should do majority of the time and they will help you live a healthier life in the long run. On the otherhand there is stuff that you will probably need a therapist to help you work through but that doesn't mean you can't start doing the basic self care things you should be doing. You can get better if you put the work in just know it will probably take a while to get results and that's just the shitty part of mental health and especially bpd.

I realize in retrospect that everything that led to me cutting these two girls out was a play by play of classic BPD symptoms. I started making a ton of self destructive and damaging life decisions. It got to be too much for my one friend; she was finishing grad school and I heard through my ex-boyfriend that she needed a break from me. I was incredibly hurt that she was venting about me behind my back and lashed out at her, told her I was done with her and I never wanted to hear from her again. The clincher: she absolutely did not care. She responded with one text before I blocked her: “I understand, I promise to never contact you again.” That hurt, SO fucking much. It proved to me she never wanted me in her life to begin with. I demonized her entirely — I switched from love to hate with the drop of a hat. 

I started to realize, after that, how much my self-destructive and impulsive and risky behaviors harmed my relationships, thereby feeding directly into how someone with BPD ends up with unstable relationships. I won’t be the one to go and beg for the friendships back. The shame stops me. That and knowing that these two girls whom I simultaneously cut out would never try to reach me again.

Start by finding things you like to do outside of this person. It can't be, Oh I like playing video games.. with HER. I like watching movies.. with her. Something completely separate from this person. If you don't know these things, try to remember the things you liked to do when you were younger. I personally had completely dropped all the things that I used to love and hyper focused on this person. I had forgotten about my love for theater, certain types of music, my relationship with God, etc. Then start doing those things. Your identity is wrapped up in this girl right now, which makes her feel like your whole world because she IS. Put yourself out there and make some more friends. Fight the urge to invest every waking second with this person. I know it's so hard but you need to. 

Once you've started finding yourself and your life outside of this person, you will feel less afraid of losing them because you have things other than them to live for. If you continue the way you are going, it will grow and grow. I was to the point of what felt like madness. My therapist said it was like a drug addiction minus the drugs.

Part of it is me just trying to end it before she can, another part is that fucked up part of me that wants her to keep me from doing it, almost like I want her to ""prove"" how much she loves me by not letting me break up with her that easily.

We've been trying to get through it though, especially after the last time when I was majorly dissociating and broke up with her after a small argument the night before. It's messed up and I only recently got the BPD diagnosis which helped explain EVERYTHING and partly why we're still together today, other than the fact that we love each other very deeply. I'm not going to pretend she's this perfect angel who's made no mistakes but what I will say is that it's incredibly important that you use MINDFULNESS in trying to distinguish what's ""real"" and what isn't.

By real I mean: is this fight REALLY worth breaking up over? Think about what's happening in the very moment, right now, as you're arguing or shortly after. If it's an argument over someone having to bail on a date, or not having done the dishes last night, it's not something you need to break up with them over right then and there.

Second most important thing after mindfulness, TAKE SPACE FOR YOURSELF. No matter how much you want to fix it rightnowrightaway nothing can be fixed in seconds like you want it to be. Communicate with your partner that you are feeling extremely upset right now and explain that you are pretty sure it's not 100% to do with the fight you're having (unless you've taken time and mindfulness to be fully sure that it is. Even if it is, take space) and you just need some time to calm down. More likely than not, so does he. It's not going to happen right away, you're just going to have to keep practicing and he's also going to have to learn how to give you space and understand when you're having an episode.

I also get some level of catharsis from the process of looking at apartment ads and trying to figure out what I would actually have to DO if we got divorced, so by the time I've gone over all those possibilities in my mind I'm kind of like ""really? You want to go to all that trouble just because of [insert disagreement/miscommunication here]?"" and then I'm able to pull myself back enough to re-regulate and be more rational. 

There have also been times where it's almost like some kind of amnesia comes over me after a bit and I can't even remember exactly what triggered me or find the words to process it. That feels like a result of dissociation/repression to me though, so it's probably not great, but it does resolve it.. kinda.

And then throughout all this I feel incredibly guilty that I claim to love him but can so easily switch to feeling totally negative about him - whereas he is weirdly patient and loving with me to the point where I honestly don't think the idea of breaking up has ever crossed his mind.

There is so much overwhelming accurate modern research on borderline personality disorder (BPD) that already disputes so much of the claims you've made throughout this thread. PwBPD here have a right to criticize inaccurate mischaracterizations of this devastating illness. You can pull the ""crazy BPD"" card on us when we disagree with you and blame black and white thinking on our differing opinions on how our illness should be described through accurate evidence based research. On a level, BPD is similar to other cluster b pds, but also so distinctively different in terms of motivations for behavior/symptoms. It is evidently linked as a way to react to prolonged childhood trauma/abuse/neglect/invalidation with combinations of genetic components (family history of mental illness, for example). There are many wonderful dedicated mental health professionals who have plenty of information out there on how BPD works. Marsha Linehan and the late Dr. John Gunderson both have created innovative treatments for BPD and have insightful understandings of it. Marsha Linehan herself struggled with BPD many decades ago when she was younger. She recovered, and has dedicated decades to helping others with BPD recover as well as educating families and the public on this complex disorder. 

Believe what you want at this point if evidence backed modern research doesn't convince you to reconsider the claims you've made. Also, not having baseline empathy isn't linked to sadistic behaviors. That is just a toxic notion promoted by media/horrors films that depict it as a motivator for uncaring and murderous intent. With BPD, we can get consumed in our own emotional turmoil, but we have capabilities for remorse and guilt. And through treatment, we can learn how to employ empathy when our emotions are overwhelming us. The brain is literally plastic. And I have plenty of people I care about in spite of wack levels of fluctuating empathy. I'm autistic upon having BPD. To say we just can't care about others, is mischaracterizations. I am living with my mother after years of being parentally alienated from her by my father to support her when her partner passed. We have no choice but to live with an emotionally manipulative grandmother, but I am literally risking retraumatization and emotional neglect to support my mother. Tell me how BPD makes me solely caring about 'my own needs'.",1566508802,{},exqyib5,False,t3_ctzjhf,False,True,t1_exprxqs,/r/BPD/comments/ctzjhf/my_teacher_just_made_me_feel_like_shit/exqyib5/,1566512259,1,True,,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I can empathize with you and recognize that you are in a place in your journey to recovery where you are becoming aware of the abuse you endured and are seeking validation for it. It can be difficult as often times friends and family members don't empathize with the abused male. I recommend these two articles that I believe will give you the validation you need and encourage you to move towards the next steps of introspection and self growth.

However, it's emotionally draining, and I don't know about you, but I don't want to feel intense hatred all the time.  Here are two things I do, personally, that help alleviate the strong emotions and urges:

Picture the person there with you right now.  Not the incident, not your feelings around them, just their face.  Hold it in your mind and just try to see them as a person.  Not a monster or a powerful force that has control over you, but another person, just like you.  I usually picture them with a neutral or even slightly sad expression that shows vulnerability.  I have intense revenge fantasies and episodes of rage, and this genuinely works for me.  

I also find guided forgiveness meditation really works.  The meditation is just for the moment, not long term.  You don't have to forgive them or even consider forgiving them, just go through the motions for your own sense of peace and a stronger grip on reality.  Think about all the times that you have hurt others and extend yourself forgiveness, then think about the people who have hurt you an extend them forgiveness.  It really helps me to think of all the times I have accidentally or intentionally hurt others to put it into perspective that all humans hurt other humans. There's a good, short guided meditation [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbHKCy4f6Dk) that I find works really well for me.

I really want to clarify that I'm not trying to suggest you long term forgive anyone or that people who have hurt you ""deserve"" forgiveness.  I just know that these are in-the-moment techniques that genuinely work for me, and can help me come down from being consumed by anger so I can get on with my day.  I have tried many things for many years and this is what has helped me the most.

I depend on him way too much which will have some serious consequences unless I step up, take control of the situation and end it while I still can. I know I'll miss him, I know I'll feel like shit afterwards, but eventually, I'll learn how to survive completely on my own. That's the main goal, I guess.

,somedude86,,,,,,,,,,,"I've also always felt naturally submissive in sexual relations and went through a heavy phase for a few years in the BDSM scene.  Similar experiences to yours; Doms didn't care about me, the scene was toxic and shitty, I was unfulfilled.  Through therapy and healing I stopped wanting these things and started looking for a relationship instead.  It wasn't a short road but I ended up in a healthy LTR with a vanilla guy, and after being with him for a while and having no urges to ""submit"", gradually found myself craving BDSM again! I brought it up with him and he was open to trying. We now participate in it only once in a while and we both care about each others needs and emotions.  I find my need for it isn't nearly as strong and one or two sessions will get it out of my head for months - probably because now I'm actually getting what I want out of the sessions and not just being used!

I can't help but feel that it's related to my illness, too, but I feel that as long as I do it in the manner that I do, it's fine.  Hopefully this helps you somewhat.  If therapy and healing make you never want to be submissive again, great!  But if you still find you want to down the line I feel you don't need to worry about whether or not it's tied to your illness - it is what it is, just be safe, healthy, and find someone who actually cares and don't settle for less.  I really think the BDSM community is really toxic and the only safe way to do things is to find a relationship based on other mutual interests and mutual respect and then bring it up later.",1515679976,,dsip7ry,False,t3_7piw2y,,,t3_7piw2y,/r/BPD/comments/7piw2y/sex_bdsm_and_bpd/dsip7ry/,1517785547,2,,,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,,,,,,True,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,60354.0,,public,,1515680413.0,,,,,,

I totally get where you're coming from - about one little mistake wiping everything else clean.  What has been helpful for me when something like this happens: Brainstorm the possible outcomes and likelihood of those outcomes actually happening.  In your case it might look something like:

a) [insert worst case scenario here] - chance of that happening: probably close to 0% chance

b) your boss is slightly unhappy, and reminds you to keep a close eye on pricing, etc.  - chance of that happening: 20%?

c) your boss thanks you for using good customer service, and confirms $25-30 isn't much in the grand scheme of things and will balance out.  - Chance of this happening: 60%?

etc..
For me when I look at all the scenarios I am reminded that my boss has much bigger fish to fry and my mistake will not make or break anyone.  If they are a good boss they will know how much that mistake probably worries you more than them!

It is a result of an underdeveloped capacity to process information dialectically.  That is literally the reason that the word ""dialectic"" is used in DBT.

Unfortunately we live in a culture which (to our detriment) subjugates objective reality to subjective reality and as a result, terms such as ""splitting"" become debased rapidly by the very communities for which they were coined.  Therapists who do not correct us when we misuse terminology such as this are equally if not more guilty of perpetuating this problem as well.

I'm kinda in the same boat as you are. I'm with someone (not married), and it was because of this relationship, and her help, that I got on to therapy and discovered I had BPD. Since then, yes, I've put a label on my ""illness"", but have also been able to reflect and acknowledge a lot of my behaviours. Doesn't mean that I don't react and behave impulsively. I still do. But being ""aware"" of these behaviours - even in post-mortem is a huge learning experience and a step towards ""actively"" recovering. 

Unfortunately, recently, I discovered my so-called SO's username  (literally lurked on familiar groups talked about here and figured out all the stuff she's writing about us). Yes, I completely logically understand that she goes there to vent - especially when I'm splitting. I haven't told her that I know. However, she's expressed to me casually that she does visit those places when I split so she can vent. But recently, I've noticed that she's there and talking about things and compartmentalising (as someone here mentioned) me even when we are in a good space together. 

I'm trying REALLY hard not to go crazy in my head. But this is really breaking me and making me literally oscillate between the 2 extremes in my head: 1) I honestly don't deserve to live - to put people through so much in their lives... TO 2) Fuck this relationship. Fuck all relationships. This is ridiculous. She's just pretending to look good and stay ""supposedly strong"" for me - coz she's using this to get validation somehow for everything herself. 

Everything keeps jading between being fake and real. 

I literally cannot concentrate on work or any other part of my life (well, there's not much other than work). Reading the way she's ""ALREADY"" made up her mind about the kind of person I am, is really tearing me apart. Yet, when we speak, we're in a good place.

it's a lot easier said than done, but reach out to your partner. tell him specifically when you are starting to go into the negative thought cycle. if the two of you have to recite out loud, ""everything will be okay! we're going to have fun!"" in order to alleviate the tension, it's what you gotta do.

otherwise, and i know this may not be doable in the immediate future with health insurance not being available at the moment, but pretty much any GP will prescribe xanax if you tell them you are having frequent panic attacks. it helps to take the edge off when you are starting to do things that scare you, and you can eventually taper off.",1550195870,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",egi2nrv,,t3_aqrfr6,,True,t3_aqrfr6,/r/BPD/comments/aqrfr6/an_episodepanic_attack_just_kept_me_from_going_to/egi2nrv/,1550195871,1,True,,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s hard to realize, but it’s scary to others (such as your wife) to try to help or understand your issues. try to understand that she’s not a therapist, and doesn’t have professional experience on dealing with your emotions/feelings. it’s a lot of weight/pressure that you are placing on her shoulders. DONT dwell on the situation. instead; do anything you can to better yourself, for your yourself. learn about yourself, your depression, read studies/articles on your symptoms or disorders.

seek professional help, sounds cliche. but if you TRULY want your wife to be comfortable and safe with you, you will do anything to accomplish that. but dwelling on that night, continually bringing it up, asking about it, will only make your wife more frustrated.  understand that it happened, it was a shitty night; but you can come back from this. 

I dealt with some of these issues, self harm while in relationship, crying spells, impulsive behavior. unfortunately all of that is toxic in a relationship. that doesn’t mean your relationship is screwed, because it’s not. everything will pass, but you need to keep going, and look into getting professional help. there are people out there that know EXACTLY what is going on in your brain, you just have to take initiative. 

before the next time you think about cutting, think about the outcome it will bring, remember this feeling that you are having now. remember how your wife felt. if you don’t want to hurt her or your feelings, you will take control of your actions and prevent yourself from this self harming behavior.

but if you don’t take initiative, and actually try to change your ways... things won’t change, just get worse and more toxic. I wish you the best.

,LostInTheAbsurd,,,[],,,,text,t2_qjvd0,False,,"See lately I've been thinking I might have PTSD, but I can't actually remember any serious trauma.  I mean I dealt with normal stuff, like bullying, and bullying from my older siblings. Also my dad never treated me like my brother or sister and I developed a severe inferiority complex. 

But I know at some point, approximately around the middle of 3rd grade, my personality completely changed. I had been very comfortable talking to people, making friends, expressing my attitude. I was very fiesty. I also really loved going to school. I even remember one time I was really sick, and I lied and said I felt better so I could go to school. I had to ask the teacher to go to the bathroom so I could throw up, and Every time she asked, I would lie and say I wasn't sick. Eventually have in and went home.

But somewhere around 3rd grade I completely shifted. I stopped talking to other students. I completely stopped doing any school work, and ended up never being able to go to recess, because I was supposed to be working on my school work. I never did though. I would just draw, or if be lost in another world in my mind. This is when they started suspecting i had ADD, but somehow when they asked me questions, they determined I was fine. Idk if I lied or not. I didn't officially get diagnosed with ADHD until I was an adult.

Anyway, that's pretty much how my life went, from 3rd grade to high school. I started actually trying in high school, but I always struggled to make myself even care enough to do my school work. Same with college, which I left when I started having health issues. 

I always think back and wonder what happened to me. I went from being a happy, fun, spunky kid, to extremely depressed, hopeless, suffering severe social anxiety. Maybe nothing happened and mental illness just manifested. But the change was just so drastic. I've suspected that maybe I had been sexually molested or raped, just because of a lot of my thoughts and fears around sexual stuff. But I'm not going to go too much into that. I've just always really struggled  being comfortable with sex.

It could just be from being taken advantage a lot when I was too young to understand. But it was never physical. Sorry.

Although I had a previous BAD diagnosis — which bizarrely I have “fully recovered” from — I wouldn’t say I have BPD, although I have a few friends who are. I follow this so I can relate more and be a better more understanding/empathetic friend. This complicates whether I can even contribute to the conversation, but here goes: 

I have had some childhood and adolescent trauma - incessantly bullied, statutory raped and absent parents. Although I’m presently considered neurotypical (if you can even call it being NT after recovering from a mental illness) but I acknowledge that I used to carry this burden of previous trauma around with me. 

I actively journal in the present day, and have a much higher than average intelligence and reasonable memory, however from the age of 17 and under I don’t have one clear memory that cannot directly be attributed to seeing an old photo or having a friend/relative remember a story... 

I can very much relate to memory repression, it continues to this day. Is there any “safe” way to access better memory or to avoid repression? I’d like to try psychotherapy, but I haven’t had a response from the practitioners in my area.

I love his girlfriend,  this came to a shock to me because I respect and love him so much, including his relationship (which he kept hidden from me for months btw). I’ve never (intentionally at least) flirted with him,Ive always respected his boundaries as he has mine because I’m so grateful to have ever ,etc someone who treated me with so much love and kindness, he’s the first person I’ve completely let my walls down and trust. It was hard in the beginning but as we grew closer, he really showed me that he loves me and would never judge me or abandon me, which were the two fears I had that paralyzed me and shut him out. Yet, I really believed him. When he told me I am a good person, it was the first time I could hear that and feel like it’s true. I grew a lot from the time I met him, all the way till now. I am so thankful for how his friendship and love really helped me start to love myself too.

I woke up on Monday with nasty and abrasive texts from his girlfriend, someone I considered my friend, too. I have only ever been nice to her, g
so genuine,y because she and my fp were always there for me. 

The first text I read, calling me a desperate pathetic waste of i life and to go fuck my self was all I could handle, yet she sent plenty more, harassing me while I sat paralyzed in fear not opening any of the fifteen other texts. I think if I read it all i it’s entirety I would have killed myself. I only caught glimpses on the previews, but I couldn’t bear risk opening them. I would have killed myself. 

I texted my fp asking what happened, expressing how hurt and confused I was. He responded “l0srgrl, I cant be your friend anymore. We cannot be friends”. I spiraled begging him to stay, which resulted in his girlfriend sending screenshots of my distraught texts to me and mocking me then insulting my character, and more and more and more. The things I did read, now play on a constant loop in my head. I shut my phone off, I could not take it anymore. Nothing felt real anymore. When I finally open my phone again, I’m blocked on everything. Every trace of him is gone. I cannot process this grief right now. I am complete dissociated. My brain won’t accept that it’s real. But I know it is. 
I do t know how to be real any,ore. I don’t want to be me and come to a realization of how this actually did happen,the one person you ever felt completely safe is gone forever. I would kill myself if I let myself feel the hurricane of pain from that truth. Idk how else to describe anything right now let alone my emotions. I tried to force myself to do dbt chain analysis for emotions but I can’t do it. I’m scared. It will make it too real. I don’t know what to feel. Please help me understand what is happening

I feel rotten to the core. I can’t ever do this again. I’m never loving someone again. I’m never letting someone love me again. I can’t los anger person. I can’t take another hit to my entire being. I don’t think I can live anymore. I cannot process this. I have no one. I have nothing. I can’t bear to have to sit with myself. I could throw up from how disgusted I m to be me. It’s li,e my entire life I’ve tried and tried to purge this demon tossing my insides and outsides up. Then each time I fail To, I realize more and more that it’s me. I’m the disgusting unlovable demon. I need to go. I cause pain I am pain. I am a ball of pain and I bring nothing to this world but pain. I am pain and existsence is pain.

You are familiar with splitting yes?

Its kind of like splitting on my own emotions, i guess the easiest way to discribe it is that my empathy turns on and off randomly. Kinda like how you can be happy one minute or crying the next.

Personally it takes alot of concentration to remember that other people have feelings and can get hurt. I have to constantly remind myself of this around other people.

Its very important to me that I control these impulses, ironically this combined with social skills courses as a kid has made me hyperaware of everything I might be doing wrong, and I can see things from multiple points of view. Like my friend is upset at someone for doing something/saying some thing, I cant be upset/mad for her/with her but i can list various reasons other person might have done it and that usually makes them feel better.

A month ago we got into the biggest fight because I kept obsessing over this coworker that he sorta half-dated before meeting me (she rejected him).
She is honestly gorgeous and I feel so insecure around her (like I have always felt too big and she’s petite). My heart sinks when I run into her. It literally makes me want to throw up.
My boyfriend is attracted to me and he shows it all the time (same as you, boners when we hang out at work, telling me I’m beautiful all the time...). 
He is the most loving and understanding and sweet man on earth and I love him with all my heart. Yet I keep acting like a complete bitch and cornering him into comparing us. 
He says he is so much more attracted to me because of how much of he loves me. But I cornered him by asking « if you didn’t know either of us and ran into both of us at a party, who would you want to talk to first ». He said he did t know and knowing what a sweet man he is it obviously means her.

[],Compassionate_Cat,,,[],,,,text,t2_1rxgevrs,False,,"I think the psychological test here is asking yourself if this problem has to do with the person's action being wrong, or something in our heads being wrong. I wouldn't pretend that my partner could satisfy all of my sexual needs exactly the way I want, that's just some fairy tale bullshit, right? I'd be enthusiastic about helping them orgasm, but if they wanted something I couldn't give them and my partner wanted to look at porn, I'd be glad for them in the same way I'd be glad they're looking at a show on Netflix they enjoy but I don't. After all, I can't create a Netflix special to entertain them with, can I? That's an absurd expectation. Sex is no different. You simply can't be perfect for another person - you can only be you. Now, if your bedroom is dead and they're spending hours on pornhub every day, that's another story. But occasional porn? We're human beings. Insecure, imperfect human beings. And that's fine as long as we acknowledge that we're all insecure and imperfect in some way.

So don't take this response as ""You should never be envious of videos of naked people"", because it's complicated. You're a human being too. It's true that it does hurt to have your partner engaging a very partner-y ... thing... without you. Every human wants attention. Every human feels good when people care about them, especially sexually. So I'm not suggesting you're selfish. This is sort of where the complexity of a relationship comes in, and here I have no helpful advice alas. Here's where my level headed advice turns into cynicism, so you've been warned. I think relationships are almost always have a toxic dynamic of one person getting the upper hand somehow. Either one person is lying to themselves, or both people are lying to themselves, and either both people are getting a crappy deal, or one person is. It's so rare, maybe impossible, for two people to be happy together.

But I'm not saying this to bum you out, I'm just saying that's what I see as reality. If you discover this is also how reality works based on your own experiences, then that can be empowering. Then you can tell yourself something like: ""Okay... I know relationships are bullshit, and I know what I'm in for, and I know what my boundaries are, and I know this relationship is going to full of flaws and human stupidity, and I accept and acknowledge that."" By doing this, you at least immunize from being disappointed when you discover your partner is sort of being an asshole(Not saying they are, just saying it's kind of inevitable from my own bleak yet realistic view of things).",1562888981,{},etk4wy9,False,t3_cc3357,False,True,t3_cc3357,/r/BPD/comments/cc3357/dae_get_hurt_by_knowing_their_partner_watches_porn/etk4wy9/,1562888982,-4,True,,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,0.0,1562975378.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eg. Someone says ""I had a horrific childhood, people with BPD should not have kids"". Obviously that hurts because not all people with BPD are like that. If someone with BPD says something about it like ""Not all of us are like that"", that hurts them because it invalidates their feelings.

[],mummacoconut,,,[],,,,text,t2_1ebxb9rp,False,,"I’m unsure how you could go about this conversation with your partner, my best suggestion would be to have a completely open conversation with him about BPD and how it affects you etc, however it would be best to do it on a relatively good day as you don’t want to accidentally trigger yourself and have the conversation lead off topic due to an emotional reaction, however I understand it’s also impossible to predict moods and they can happen out of the blue sometimes.

As a previous weed user myself, I know how it feels to use it to help with the symptoms of the disorder, I’m about to reach the ‘week without weed’ marker, as it was only a recent decision for me to stop using. It would also be beneficial to let him know that whilst things will get worse during withdrawal and adjustment to the new coping skills, it will also get better. If he is aware of this it may aid him in being able to understand and deal with the added emotional strain that is happening at the moment.

It’s also good to point out that marijuana is only mentally addictive, so the main focus point should be working on the habit of smoking and the mental addiction itself. Putting new coping skills in place may assist you in this process. For example: when I find myself slipping into a negative episode, or into a situation I would usually deal with by having a smoke, I take myself away from the situation and give myself something else to focus on. My preferred tactic is knitting. It’s a simple task which you can do for as long as you like, plus it’s something creative instead of destructive. Also helps that I can stab balls of wool with the needles if I’m ever too stressed out! However watching whatever I’m knitting at the time gradually grow is satisfying to me somehow. I feel like I’m doing something positive with the negative emotion instead of letting it control me.

I hope this helps, and if you ever need someone to talk to whilst you’re going through this, someone who might understand a bit more what you’re going through, feel free to drop me a message :) we can quit together! I believe in you! 

And whilst you may not see much in yourself, there must be a reason your partner is with you, and it wouldn’t be the weed or external factors. You are the sweet and lovely girl he fell for, everyone has bad days, it’s just something that he needs to be aware of if he’s going to have any chance of being able to help you or atleast support you whilst you’re going through it

BPD usually develops as a result of a childhood trauma, like abandonment by someone they trusted and loved. So when triggered the pwBPD often regresses back to that point as a child where their emotional development is stuck. 
As a toddler or young child we develop very strong emotional attachments to the people we are closest to, if something tragic happens during that period of time when they are so emotionally vulnerable like abandonment by the person or persons they trust and love they don't understand and will subsequently develop separation anxiety. Reacting the only way a young child knows how to, becoming impatient, easily frustrated, and unable to control their feelings. Consequently, toddlers/little kids are known to dissolve into tears, become fussy, whiney or throw a fit. Same basic behaviors adults with BPD resort to, when those fears of abandonment and other triggering emotions are set in motion by something someone close to them says or does. 

The good news for a pwBPD is that our brains are still capable of absorbing like a sponge and learning all those coping skills they didn't get as a child.

&gt;I dated someone with BPD, who didn't tell me she had it (no excuse for that ignorance) and who lied about basically everything else she ever said (no excuse for that ignorance), and I desperately try to understand/feel what you are all going through because, contrary to the nonsense you just spouted, I don't look at people who go through serious problems as a joke. In fact, I feel bad for this person that she felt such shame she would just assume I would throw her to the curb.

I'm sorry she hurt you. Not all of us are like that, in fact I'd say most of us aren't. In my relationships and based off what I've read in this subreddit most people tell the person they're seeing they have BPD within a date or two, for me I've done it before I even meet IRL. She might not even have had it, if she was as manipulative as you say. She could've been an ASPD sociopath but she changed the diagnosis to manipulate you, who knows.

&gt;If you met me in person and told me what was up I would try (and probably fail judging on your negative and dismissive presumption towards us NON's) to be there for you and support you in any possible way I could because, after all my research and reading, I understand how difficult it really must be to have BPD.

Most people say this, in practice almost nobody even bothers to begin doing that extensive research, including both of my parents.

&gt;To really try to understand what you all go through so in the event I encounter another person who suffers from this illness I am properly equipped to being a POSITIVE person in their lives because, in reality, people like me who don't have it are usually left in the dark and abused in some way during our time. It is regrettable but it is true.

Yeah, that's good of you. Understanding BPD makes it so much easier to deal with for everyone.

&gt;I experience pain. My fucking brother died in December. I cry almost every single day.

So do I, for little to no reason, for like 7 years. That's the difference between you and me.

&gt; It hurts me so deeply I highly doubt you would understand or even care. How dare you presume we don't experience pain ""like you do""? When did you become the only group to be able to feel pain more effectively or deeper? That is ridiculous and highly offensive.

Because, it is scientifically proven that [you don't.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_pain#Emotional_agony_in_borderline_personality_disorder) If you feel like from what you've read about BPD there isn't a huge difference in how we experience pain then I don't know what to say.

&gt;Barely human? Ignorance? I am going to put this bluntly whether you like it or not: Yes, there is a stigma with mental illness. I think that sucks. I also would give my life right now, for all of you, to take back whatever you experienced when you were growing up so you didn't have to deal with it. That, however, does not excuse you for your actions, your words, and allow you to evade responsibility for prejudging people who do not have this disorder as heartless bastards.

I don't think anyone disagrees with this, however there are people out there who simply do not have the emotional capacity to care about us and it's important for us to recognize that to protect ourselves and others. My ideal partner would be another person with BPD, if I'm being honest.",1552001499,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ei16218,,t3_ayfucp,,True,t1_ei1390y,/r/BPD/comments/ayfucp/why_cant_i_just_handle_life_like_everyone_else/ei16218/,1552001500,1,True,,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1.  I dated someone with BPD, who didn't tell me she had it (no excuse for that ignorance) and who lied about basically everything else she ever said (no excuse for that ignorance), and I desperately try to understand/feel what you are all going through because, contrary to the nonsense you just spouted, I don't look at people who go through serious problems as a joke.  In fact, I feel bad for this person that she felt such shame she would just assume I would throw her to the curb.  If you met me in person and told me what was up I would try (and probably fail judging on your negative and dismissive presumption towards us NON's) to be there for you and support you in any possible way I could because, after all my research and reading, I understand how difficult it really must be to have BPD.
2. To really try to understand what you all go through so in the event I encounter another person who suffers from this illness I am properly equipped to being a POSITIVE person in their lives because, in reality, people like me who don't have it are usually left in the dark and abused in some way during our time.  It is regrettable but it is true.  


I experience pain.  My fucking brother died in December.  I cry almost every single day.  It hurts me so deeply I highly doubt you would understand or even care.  How dare you presume we don't experience pain ""like you do""?  When did you become the only group to be able to feel pain more effectively or deeper?  That is ridiculous and highly offensive.   


Barely human?  Ignorance?  I am going to put this bluntly whether you like it or not:  Yes, there is a stigma with mental illness.  I think that sucks.  I also would give my life right now, for all of you, to take back whatever you experienced when you were growing up so you didn't have to deal with it.

You judge yourself harshly by firm values.

You judge yourself for failing to maintain those values in adversity.

Your identity is only consistent in those values, not your actions.

Then you are those values.

Above all else you want to love and be loved. That is the value by which you judge your actions, and when you fail to be love, you destroy yourself for failing.

That is not love. These values and actions are not yours, they are heresy and they are hypocrisy and they must be stopped.

To act in accordance with your values is to be love.

To act in accordance with your truest need is to love and be loved, to be love.

You are love, already, there is no ""deserve"", that is a word invented by fear. Fear is the heresy that clouds your judgment, the poisonous fruit.

Fear is the lie, the demon to be cast out. You are and know that the only truth is love, no heresy or hypocrisy can overcome that once you remember.

I believe it's important to avoid to the maximum to make a patient dissociate more and a good psychologist is evaluating at any time, during the treatment which would consist at first by the lecture of the events of the life of the patient (LI Timeline), if the patient is dissociating. If he is dissociating the therapist should stop and bring the patient back to ""here and now"" thanks to some specific technics. The therapists applying Integration lifespan therapy believe that the patient shouldn't be encouraged to dissociate more or to think of himself as separate entities, for example the patient shouldn't be encourage to give names to the different personalities and the therapist should use the own words of the patient only to talk about them. 
The idea is to reinforce the integration of all the alters into one unified person. Perhaps if you dissociate a lot the therapist wouldn't be able to finish his lecture of your life the first or second time, perhaps it would take several times, but with time people dissociate less and less when exposed to the reading of the LI timeline",1551993712,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ei0v1gp,,t3_ay1ah5,,True,t1_ei00neu,/r/BPD/comments/ay1ah5/has_anyone_here_tried_edmr_therapy/ei0v1gp/,1551993713,1,True,,False,BPD,t5_2qqdp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of this I missed a lot of school. In my second year of Highschool my guidance teacher told me I wasn't smart enough to get into medical school and that I should aim more realistic like retail or manual labor. Then in my fourth year he told me that because I was off a lot I was not allowed to sit my exams and that I was not allowed to come back for my fifth year and ultimately forced me to drop out with no qualifications, not even a Highschool degree. Right before I left he just had to fucking rub salt in the wound and said ""so, do you still want to go to medical school or have you decided to think more realistically."" I will NEVER forget that sentence for as long as I live. 

I got into college and then had to drop out in the first year because I got glandular fever. Then I tried the first year again and almost had to drop out because my neurosurgy was scheduled for February and I needed two months off college to recover. The only reason I finished that year was because my surgery got rescheduled for June. I got to move to the second year and due to surgery complications I was stuck with crippling headaches and had to see the doctors a lot. The entire year my course tutor kept pressuring me to drop out. She said I wouldn't do well in the exams and that it's a waste of time blah blah blah. All fucking year I heard that shit from her, only to get the best fucking grades in class. Needless to say she was stunned.

My ex was an example of this. He used to be caring, empathic, and never held grudges, but eventually my repetitive BPD episodes slowly drained this out of him. He started picking up on more of my “wrong” behavior and wouldn’t always pick up on his own. For a while I thought he became abusive and lost empathy, but in reality, he had become hyper vigilant himself. We’ve been doing a lot better since I identified my manipulative behaviors and started switching them with actually stating my needs. He’s starting to return the effort too.  

I also try to remember that there have been and will be times when people will think the same towards me. There are probably times when I hurt someone more than I realize, but they chose to let it go. Maybe they put effort towards understanding me that I don’t even know about too.

,gagrushenka,,,[],,,,text,t2_so2sn,False,,"Yes, but doctors are trained to properly interpret the DSM. Laypeople are not. 
I'm not invalidating the suffering and experience of people who have been raised by people who might have NPD, but they can't just say that's what it is when it might not be. They don't have the expertise to make that judgement. When they do make those judgements without any qualification to do so, they open the door for every disgruntled ex to vent about their 'BPD' or 'bipolar' ex or for anyone to make similar judgements about people with issues whose behaviour negatively affected them. 

As for what would a doctor see that others wouldn't? Well, for example, experiences of trauma in small children can lead to the same symptoms as ADHD. Sometimes medications have side effects that cause symptoms similar to mental illness - I knew a girl who was misdiagnosed as bipolar because her epilepsy medication was giving her bad side effects. Brain damage and trauma can have varied effects that might make them look like they're something else. Someone close to me looked very much like he had NPD and his bipolar was a misdiagnosis but it turned out he was also schizophrenic and he needed different medication. In my interpretation of the DSM, he would have ticked every box. He did a lot of things to me and others that wouldn't be unusual amongst the stories over at raisedbynarcissists. But he doesn't have NPD, and I would have been wrong if I'd labelled him as such. I don't know enough about all the other possibilities to make a judgement. That's why I'm saying doctors get to diagnose. That doesn't invalidate people's experiences - does it matter if their parent has NPD or not? They were still treated badly or exploited regardless. Their suffering is still valid even if their parent doesn't have NPD.

[],OpulentPink,,,[],,,,text,t2_5aa6205p,False,[],"Honestly, I tried distracting. I made a schedule where I was busy for nearly every single minute of the day. I followed it for 6 months almost rigorously and it completely wore me out. Even if I don't actively think about the people I've lost I can feel their absence like some sort of pit in my very being. I have sleep issues too in that I have nightmares every night and well, you can imagine what sort of stuff goes on there.

In regards to feeling alienated, I'd say it's sort of different from dissociating. I can't speak for others, but for me dissociating felt like I was existing on a plane above reality, and everything felt hyper real and I was extremely observant of every small detail. Like my soul just went out of my body and was observing everything around it. Alienation and not belonging on the other hand doesn't make me feel that way. I exist in reality, but reality doesn't feel like I'm home. It's more akin to being teleported to a foreign country where everyone speaks your language but acts in the most erratic and odd ways that nothing feels familiar. Like being lost in new city. But there's an element of hatred and resentment in there too. For some reason I'm very much at peace with the idea of death. It feels like a natural end. But everything else about reality doesn't sit well with me at all.

I don't know who to blame, reality or people? Reality allows people leaving to be a thing, Reality allows fickleness to be a thing, for suffering. Can I really blame people for following what reality itself has mandated? Why does reality allow people like me to exist at all? Should I be even pointing fingers and blaming in the first place? All this has made the concept of individuals, society and existence sort of blend into 1 main thing which I feel deep rooted resentment and alienation from. And I feel that because I don't fit this 'great machine' at all. It's hard to rationally convince myself to care for people, but luckily my emotional side is very much functional and cares anyway.

Maybe that's why I never felt I had a life outside the people in it. Maybe my connection to my best friend also served as my connection to the rest of the world. But maybe not, since I miss her as an individual. 

The trans community feel too focused on labels. Coming from a place where trans people have basically no rights a lot of the movement and its cultural identity feels extremely superficial to me. Why create so many barriers between trans and normal women/men? Why have a distinction (apart from the medical field ofc)? I'm still sorting out whether my dysphoria is valid or not, but If I want to be a women, I don't want to be identified separately from 'cis' women.

What these findings — elevated glutamatergic neurotransmission and decreased GABAergic neurotransmission — indicate in the context of the symptoms and pathology of BPD is that the abnormalities in neurochemistry exist in conjunction with abnormalities in functional behavior and neural communication within the brain.

Particularly, because BPD is a disorder of personality, it is likely that these abnormalities exist within the frontal lobes, where streams of sensory perception are integrated into cognition are then translated to behavior and identity. Increased glutamatergic neurotransmission and decreased GABAergic neurotransmission mean that excitatory neuron networks and the signals they carry are not easily insulated or muted. 

Glutamate in particular is perhaps the most generally messenger-like of the neurotransmitters insofar as it generally underlies the transmission of most information within the brain. In the context of this finding, one can conclude that there are areas of the brain in those with BPD which facilitate an abnormally high amount of neurotransmission; coupled with the behavioral and emotional symptoms of BPD, these areas of brain are likely those associated with emotional reasoning, social reasoning, empathy and self-awareness  as well as the integration of emotion and sensation in cognition.

Forgive yourself that you didnt know any better, because you really haven't. And he need to forgive himself for not being strong enough to motivate you to change etc.

I was diagnosed shortly after my divorce, all in the last months. Its tough realising all the wrongs I did, but again, it was the best I knew... 
Not saying that as an excuse, just an explanation.

We didnt cheat, didnt hit them etc.
Were just lost souls that never learned how to deal with those situations and ourselves.

Only good will come out of all this, if we admit, accept, grow, and evolve...

Personally relationships trigger the worst in me, so I avoid it unless I meet someone really worthy. And for now I also warn all my hookups that I am BPD and that they should stay the fuck away, but girls just dont listen.. I try to control myself, but incase the demons come out, they have been warned.

I think its the best approach to inform the people that like you what they will be dealing with.

I mostly like psychedelics, which I think is a healthy drug of choice. I can't take LSD every day or even every week.

It helps me keep away from party drugs being able to delay gratification like that. I know I won't be able to take a big dose of acid if I have bad vibes from a molly hangover.

,imdep,,,[],,,,text,t2_jb521,,,"Yes, you can. I've seen it and now I'm attempting to do this. It's a LOT of work. You really have to be committed to facing your fears and do everything humanly possible to adequately assess your own strengths and weaknesses. Recovery is not only about you anymore when you're training to be a therapist; it's now an ethical imperative to seek help and healing for yourself. Getting therapy and being extremely serious about doing everything humanly possible to gain control over your issues and develop self-awareness is important. Also, you need to learn to regulate and tolerate discomfort. You have to learn to look at the darkest parts of your soul and not crumble/fall apart. You have to learn to fully feel your emotional reactions while keeping it together enough to fully assess your reaction in the best interest of the client. I don't know how I'll do yet, but it's f\*cking terrifying. 

I actually really recommend something more psychodynamic like TFP or MBT if you have access to it if you want to become a therapist...it's really helping me become much more accepting of my imperfections. It increases your reflective capacity...which is THE MOST IMPORTANT THING for a therapist (aside from maybe empathy). TFP, for me, goes beyond the emotion regulation skills that I've learned from DBT. You need to be able to really really took at yourself and dissect your actions without falling apart to be a good therapist. Look into all treatment options for yourself 

Also, go slow if you need to. I love psychology and I've decided that, even if I don;t become a therapist, I might go back to more basic research or go into something like academic counseling (because I know I'm good at that). Try becoming a therapist, do everything you can to make this experience a good one for yourself and for your patients during practicum, and have a good plan B that you would genuinely enjoy pursuing. 

But, you having BPD doesn't automatically disqualify you from becoming a therapist. In fact, if you get to a certain point in recovery, it can actually be a blessing in disguise because I've met people like this. Talk to me in 10 years and maybe I can tell you what's become of my journey...but there are many many other people. ... trust me.

There are times when I realize that I've twisted my therapist's words. However, I also have had experience with a therapist who refused to believe I had a BPD diagnosis because ""I didn't 'feel' borderline"" to her. She also proceeded to say some very disparaging things about BPD that really made no sense. She supported my denying the BPD label for 3-4 years. Obviously the denial was primarily my fault, but her dismissal of my diagnosis was not helping matters. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's ridiculous that she thinks that bipolar disorder has a better prognosis. Yes, bipolar disorder can be managed with meds....so if meds are the only option, then I guess you're fucked if you have BPD. However, borderline personality disorder has six empirically validated treatment modalities developed for it: DBT, STEPPS, general psychiatric management, transference focused psychotherapy, schema focused psychotherapy, and mentalization-based therapy. Seriously. SIX treatments that have data to support their effectiveness. The amount of data supporting DBT is insane. If BPD couldn't be treated, how/why would therapists be creating treatments for this condition? Are these people all liars? Are they fudging their data? Are they selling false hope to their patients? In fact, I've actually heard BPD called the ""good prognosis diagnosis."" Even without doing anything, between the ages of 18-24, and definitely past the 30s, there is a reduction of symptoms. I don't know about you, but there are there books about people who have been cured from bipolar disorder (as in complete remission with no relapses)? No. Didn't think so. However, many people with BPD can actually attain a very long remission. The relapse rate for BPD is actually pretty low. And, for those who do relapse, a subsequent relapse is even lower. There is data supporting all of this. There is also data to suggest high affective empathy amongst people with BPD. Cognitive empathy may be compromised, but it can be learned. If you want/need, I can give you citations for a lot of this stuff if you want to give it to her before you report her to her board. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing. BPD is really hard to treat. It can be ""simple""...I mean, a lot of us when we encounter DBT for the first time think it's bullshit, but it requires tenacity both on the part of the client and the therapist. Seriously, it's taken me over 10 years of therapy (including two years-long stints in DBT and some time in TFP), going through lots of education in psychology, going through counseling training myself, and an incredible amount of social support from friends, family, mentors, therapists, teachers, and even institutions etc. I still am not completely better--I have a long way to go. BPD treatment is painful; I think Linehan once used a metaphor that said that that the pathway out of hell is through a  hot ladder...it is incredibly painful but it's the only way out. It is also may not feel very rewarding in the moment and can feel like you're doing a whole lot of hard nothing for no real immediate reward. So...yes there's treatment, unfortunately it's very difficult but it's far from the doom and gloom diagnosis your therapist seems to think it is. A lot of the early bias comes from the fact that a lot of psychiatrists initially trained with pwBPD who were incredibly low functioning in inpatient treatment. Those who are well drop off of the psychiatrists' radar because they're well.

We've unfortunately been handed a very distressing illness that can be very scary. Not to sound cliche, but I wanted to leave a comment on here to tell you that there is hope for people with BPD to recover, manage their symptoms, and live secure lives full of positives experiences. If you have the resources for it, I highly recommended DBT. It changed my life. I now no longer struggle with an eating disorder, suicidal ideation, self-harm, and I am currently mostly absent of BPD symptoms. I'm not saying it's a cure-all, I still experience intense emotions and heightened reactivity, and sometimes urges to do impulsive behavior. But I am able to manage those things to where it doesn't become harmful for distressing. If you don't have the resources for DBT, there are workbooks you can buy on Amazon that you can do by yourself. And I understand that DBT isn't for everyone, but that's just my recommendation based on my experience with it. If you have any questions feel free to message me. I also want you to know that though sometimes having BPD and feeling emotions as deeply as we do can be a burden, we are also incredible people with many positives to share with the world.
